AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      28

25) Have You Set Business 
Targets for Your Firm?
Immigration lawyers are busier than ever and business is good, and 
while the boom in clients is great for your bottom line, it is important to 
set business targets* for your firm. Business targets will help to keep 
you accountable to your overall goals. Business targets will help you 
determine how many cases you need to onboard to accomplish your 
goals, what kind of time and resources should be spent on individual 
cases, how much that case is worth to your overall firm goals, and how 
much you should charge per case.

Legal technology firm Clio compiled a comprehensive report on Legal 
Trends in 2017. The reported data was collected from subscribers of Clio’s 
practice management software. One of the areas covered in the report 
was assessing and estimating the average value for a case based on 
practice area. The objective for including this metric in the report was to 
allow firms to:

•	 Determine how much to charge for certain types of cases
•	 Estimate how much time and resources should be spent on 

individual cases
•	 Determine how many cases are necessary to achieve a firm’s 

financial goals

•	 Decide how much to spend, if anything, on acquiring new cases

According to Clio’s findings, the average value for a case based on the 
immigration practice area was a little under $1,000–$1,500. 

The study further concluded that:

•	 Only 54 percent of legal professionals were able to estimate their 
annual billings for 2017

•	 Only 40 percent of firms that tracked time had hourly billing targets
•	 Only 50 percent of law firms were able to bill cases based on a set 

budget

Having the capability to measure and track business progress is 
important to every law firm, small or large. But ensuring that each step is 
well-planned and consulting resources like our weekly practice success 
tips can help you understand how to achieve your firm’s business 
targets. Sticking to them even when it’s tempting to stray, will keep you 
and your firm in good health.
