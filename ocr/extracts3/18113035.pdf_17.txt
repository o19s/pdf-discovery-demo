AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      17

14) Determining Billing  
Realization Rates
In a previous Practice Success Tip, we covered Collection Realization 
Rates—how many of your clients pay once they’ve been billed. This 
week, we’ll look at Billing Realization Rates. The billing realization rate 
refers to the difference between how much time is spent on a client’s 
case and how much time is actually billed to the client.

For example, if one researches for six hours, but only bills for three 
because of not tracking time effectively or thinking it should have been 
done faster, that is a 50 percent billing realization rate for that one entry. 
A realization rate of 80 percent or less may spell financial trouble for your 
firm in the long run. A high realization rate means more money in your 
pockets. A rate of 90 percent or above is considered healthy.

Your firm can improve its billing realization rate by:

•	 Tracking time contemporaneously
•	 Promptly billing clients
•	 Designing a plan for regularly communicating with late-paying 

customers
•	 Tracking all past due accounts with thorough aging reports
•	 Sending delinquent accounts to collections within a reasonable 

timeframe
•	 Consistently reinforcing your value to your clients by billing for the 

accurate amount of time spent on a case
•	 Exercising caution when offering discounts, pro bono, or low-bono 

services and write-offs
