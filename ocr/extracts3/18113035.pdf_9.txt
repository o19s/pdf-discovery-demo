8) The Skinny on Tail Insurance
Extended reporting coverage, a.k.a. tail insurance, covers work you did 
while in practice as well as after you leave active practice, especially 
when you retire. Malpractice insurance doesn’t cover when the action 
happens, but when the client discovers the action. For a claim to be 
covered, most policies require a claim be made during the policy period 
and reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period or during 
the extended reporting period as defined in the policy. Most policies 
have a 30- or 60-day window where it will cover claims made after 
the policy expires. But a client could discover long after this window 
something she thinks is malpractice and seek recovery, so extending 
coverage makes sense. Enter tail insurance, which usually comes in 
increments of one, three, five, or unlimited years.

A carrier can build the extended reporting coverage into a policy. For 
example, the AILA Insurance Program underwritten by The Hanover 
Insurance Group offers tails for no charge after three years with them 
if the lawyer dies, retires, or leaves the practice of law because of 
disability. If tail coverage isn’t included in the policy, the cost to buy tail 
insurance is usually between 225 percent and 300 percent of one’s 
annual premium payment. Also, the tail premium cannot be financed 
because it is not for ongoing work, so it can be a hefty financial expense 
if it wasn’t built into the policy.

How Long Should My Tail Be?

Appropriate tail duration depends on your client base and cases. Do not 
just consider when you helped them. Also consider how long they may 
stay in the immigration system and could potentially discover, or think 
they discovered, a mistake made by their lawyer. An immigration case 
can easily last several years, and status changes become available at 
different durations of time. All that, as well as price, should be considered 
when deciding on a tail insurance period.

Always Read the Policy Carefully

Be aware that the terms of a tail can be limited. For example, the carrier 
may call it an unlimited tail after five years, but the fine print has age 
requirements that say something like, “unlimited if the lawyer retires over 
65 years of age, five years if retiring at 60, four years if retiring at age 59,” 
etc., until younger lawyers who leave before 50, say, get no coverage. 
Also, some policies require a lawyer to retire from the practice of law 
completely and may or may not count pro bono in that definition. It is 
important to read the policy terms carefully and discuss the meaning of 
any unclear terms with the carrier.

Tails Are Needed Sooner Than Many Think

Other common instances where extended reporting coverage is used 
are lawyer departures or lateral moves, firm dissolutions or mergers 
and acquisitions, and whenever a lawyer is leaving the practice of law. 
And remember that “retiring from the practice of law” includes leaving 
practice to do something different with your J.D., like faculty, consultant, 
politician, or actress. So even if you are young in your career, you should 
be thinking about tail insurance if you want mobility.
