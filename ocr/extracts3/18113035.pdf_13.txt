AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      13

10) Meet Client Complaints and 
Fears Head On
The immigration process takes longer now than it previously did. Given 
outcomes of two years ago have now become uncertainties. Cases 
proceed slower, require more evidence and applications, and necessitate 
appeal more often. This can set many clients on edge, especially if they 
are repeat clients that have preconceived expectations and timelines.

Road-mapping the new terrain for clients is a must, but it takes time to 
develop that road map. Take advantage of the work AILA did already. Use 
statistics and well-researched information from AILA to put the client’s 
personal experience into context and help readjust expectations. These 
publications can either be shared directly with clients or mined to write 
your own timelines, lists, and roadmaps of current cases:

Deconstructing the Invisible Wall: How Policy Changes by the Trump 
Administration Are Slowing and Restricting Legal Immigration is a 26-
page report that delves deeply into current government protocols and 
policy changes to explain delays and obstacles on many immigration 
fronts. The report finds growing backlogs and increased processing 
time and burdensome and duplicative Requests for Evidence in H-1B 
cases, to name a few hurdles. Business clients will find the statistics 
illuminating. It will help you rewrite any timelines and back up your claim 
that the backlog is no fault of the firm.

Cogs in the Deportation Machine: How Policy Changes by the Trump 
Administration Have Touched Every Major Area of Enforcement is a 21-
page report that illustrates the changes for family-immigration clients, 
from elimination of Temporary Protected Status designations to new 
enforcement tactics and implementation of blanket prosecution policies. 
While sending this report to a client who doesn’t speak English may not 
be an effective client communication option, it contains distillable lists 
and information that current clients would benefit from knowing and 

planning for. Download the report, make the list, and think about how you 
can disseminate what is most important to them right now.

The Daily News Clips, curated national and local current immigration 
news, is easy to scan and pull key issues affecting various client bases. 
It takes 10 minutes in the morning and offers you key topics to highlight 
for your clients, whether families, employers, or both.

We think of practicing law as predominantly applying the law to 
the facts. But when clients talk about lawyers they love, it is often 
the educational steps, the guidance, and counsel that clients point to 
as evidence of lawyer brilliance and loyalty. Use the tools AILA offers to 
reframe the situation for clients, help them see the bigger picture, and 
become more informed consumers.
