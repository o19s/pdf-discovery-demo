AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      8

Call to Action!

Therefore, multitasking is the enemy of your ethical duty to be diligent. 
And it sneaks up on you. Staff want access. Clients want access. Email 
is insidious. Smartphones are fun. But it is time all lawyers put the “Do 
Not Disturb” sign on their office doors and hunker down to do deep 
work for their clients’ cases in order to “vindicate [your] client’s cause…
with commitment and dedication.” Set aside time in two or more-hour 
blocks. Insist on no disruptions unless it is an emergency. Tell staff when 
you will be available. Set up regular meetings and tell them to write down 
their questions for that time, but for now, you need to go practice law in 
an undisturbed bubble.

Within your bubble, turn off the desk phone ringer, turn off the email 
notifications, put away the smartphone, shut down the computer 
monitor if you don’t need it for the task at hand, and dig into your motion 
to reopen with vigor. If you space out for a bit or get antsy, realize the 
brain needs a break and get up to walk around for a few minutes. Blood 
flow helps the brain think. Then sit back down and get back to work. 
The world is full of “opposition, obstruction, [and] inconvenience,” but 
we are lawyers. Practicing law requires we persist through to precious 
rumination. Commit to making time and space for the diligence in 
practicing law on a regular basis and your clients (and your brain) will 
thank you.

For more on the Duty of Diligence see the AILA Ethics Compendium 
Chapter about it, which includes an analysis of the model rule, an 
explanation of how each state’s Rules of Professional Conduct 1.3 
compares to the model rule, and hypotheticals developed and answered 
by experienced AILA members on the Ethics Committee. Other ethics 
concerns? See the entire Ethics Compendium.
