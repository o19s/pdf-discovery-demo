AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      5

Next, ask yourself for examples of how practicing law is a path towards 
mastery:

What milestones have I reached as a lawyer?

What do I still have left to achieve?

What is mastery for my staff positions?

What are the individual stories of mastery that inspire me?

Autonomy is “the capacity to make an informed, un-coerced decision.” 
Autonomy is essential for worker engagement, and some say it is scarce 
in law firms. Lack of autonomy is utterly demotivating. Explore your own 
ideas of autonomy by asking:

What makes me feel autonomous?

Do I have stories of autonomy or lack thereof?

If there is a lack, how can I flip that script?

Reinvent your practice with these self (and team) reflections. Draw 
on this valuable information to motivate and remind you of what is 
important. Sculpt your conclusions into a new mission statement and 
vision for the firm. Most importantly, work towards changes in firm 
culture based on the findings. (This goes for solos too—don’t forget you 
are your own bosses.)

4) What Not to Wear, Law 
Practice Style
Anyone else love makeover TV shows? They can fill a person with hope 
and positivity. They make change look achievable. They also highlight 
common wrong turns people make. There are common wrong turns law 
office owners make too.

Here is What Not to Wear, Law Office Style:

Stop wearing your Gmail/Hotmail/AOL email as your professional 
email. It just doesn’t look good. I know how it happens. You started 
the firm before professional emails were the thing, or business ramped 
up too fast. You have no time to change it and everyone knows you 
by it now, so you just keep using it. But in this day and age, it looks 
unprofessional and lazy, like wearing sweatpants to the office. Get a 
professional email.

Stop going without a website. Same vein as no professional email. 
Maybe you reach your client baseby word of mouth and you think they 
don’t use the internet very much, but the tipping point of a website being 
necessary already happened--about three years ago. Going without a 
website is like forgetting your undergarments. Use Wordpress, Google, 
or Wix to pick a site URL, choose a template, and write simple content to 
give yourself this necessary professional real estate.
