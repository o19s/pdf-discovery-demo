AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      23

Hire a company to test and train your staff. The best training brings the 
problem to life in a current, controlled environment—things like sending 
a spoofed-phishing email that says, “Click here to win a free iWatch!” to 
see how many employees click. LMG Security and Sensei Enterprises, 
Inc. have trained and helped law firms across the country with 
prevention and breach.

Though email is still the number one threat, phishing scams have been 
popping up on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media platforms. Have 
policies and procedures that cover personal website surfing on firm 
computers. Update all your software applications and remember that 
phones can catch viruses, too. Take your time and turn on your phishing 
radar when online. Whenever in doubt about an email you received, call 
the sending party on the phone before clicking any link or attachment. 
(If you don’t know the sender, beware that the person answering the 
phone may be part of the scam.)

21) Creating Hotkeys to 
Streamline Processes
You can customize Hotkeys for your specific workflow. (Since Microsoft 
products are used by most immigration lawyers, we will use it to 
demonstrate.) For example, if you were following the Formatting Text 
Hotkeys workflow (step 4) in Hotkeys: The Key to Efficiency and wished 
there was a Hotkey for turning the text from Times New Roman to Calibri, 
you could make it so by assigning it like this:

1. Go to Word Options.
2. Select Customization from the menu on the left.
3. Select Customize button towards the bottom. It will bring up the 

Customize Keyboard menu.
4. Find Fonts in the Categories menu on the left. (There are hundreds 

of options.)

5. Find Calibri in the Fonts menu on the right.
6. Type the keys you want to assign in the Press new shortcut 

key box.

Careful with taking an already assigned key and reassigning it 
though. Ctrl+B won’t make text bold if you assign it to another action.

This example is in Microsoft products, but you can customize hotkeys in 
other products as well.
