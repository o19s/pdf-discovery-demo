Justice Department Demands Documents and Threatens to Subpoena 23
Jurisdictions As Part of 8 U.S.C. 1373 Compliance Review

The Department of Justice today sent the attached letters to 23 jurisdictions, demanding the production of documents
that could show whether each jurisdiction is unlawfully restricting information sharing by its law enforcement officers
with federal immigration authorities.

All 23 of these jurisdictions were previously contacted by the Justice Department, when the Department raised
concerns about laws, policies, or practices that may violate 8 U.S.C. 1373, a federal statute that promotes information
sharing related to immigration enforcement and with which compliance is a condition of FY2016 and FY2017 Byrne
JAG awards.


The letters also state that recipient jurisdictions that fail to respond, fail to respond completely, or fail to respond in a
timely manner will be subject to a Department of Justice subpoena.


“I continue to urge all jurisdictions under review to reconsider policies that place the safety of their communities and
their residents at risk,” said Attorney General Jeff Sessions. “Protecting criminal aliens from federal immigration
authorities defies common sense and undermines the rule of law. We have seen too many examples of the threat to
public safety represented by jurisdictions that actively thwart the federal government’s immigration enforcement—
enough is enough.”


Failure to comply with section 1373 could result in the Justice Department seeking the return of FY2016 grants,
requiring additional conditions for receipt of any FY2017 Byrne JAG funding, and/or jurisdictions being deemed
ineligible to receive FY2017 Byrne JAG funding.


The following jurisdictions received the document request today:


Chicago, Illinois;
Cook County, Illinois;
New York City, New York;
State of California;
Albany, New York;
Berkeley, California;
Bernalillo County, New Mexico;
Burlington, Vermont;
City and County of Denver, Colorado;

AILA Doc. No. 18012435. (Posted 1/24/18)
