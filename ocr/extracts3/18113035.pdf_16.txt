13) Getting Paid by Your Clients
Many immigration lawyers are looking for ways to ensure that they 
receive payment for work done for clients. Analyzing the firm’s (and 
individual lawyers’) collection realization rates will tell you the difference 
between how much is billed to clients, and how much the clients 
actually pay for.

Collection realization rates of 90 percent or higher are considered 
normal. 80 percent or below are troublesome, especially if combined 
with a low billing realization rate which we will look at in an upcoming 
Practice Success Tip.

If the firm is collecting 80 percent or less, it is time to make some 
changes. Even if the firm is collecting 90 percent, there is room for 
improvement. So, what are other lawyers like you doing to improve their 
collection realization rate?

•	 Accepting credit card payments
•	 Arranging strict monthly payment plans
•	 Billing in a timely manner
•	 Evaluating and declining to represent clients that are a poor fit
•	 Promptly initiating collection actions on past due accounts
•	 Using tightly written agreements spelling out the consequences for 

late payments
•	 Implementing phase/stage flat fee structures
•	 Charging flat fees paid in advance

make better business decisions for your firm and improve your practice!
