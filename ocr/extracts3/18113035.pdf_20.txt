17) Cyberattack Reminders — 
Vigilance Is Best Defense
Cyberattacks happen often. Firm size does not matter. 80 percent of 
businesses—large and small—report attacks. Familiarize yourself with 
current hacks so you and staff do not fall for them:

A client’s email was hacked. Unaware of the breach for months, the 
lurking perpetrator struck when the settlement came through. She 
posed as the client, sent an email requesting funds be wired promptly. 
The law firm was out hundreds of thousands of dollars. Establish a 
policy of never wiring money to a client before the client is called on 
the phone. They could have avoided the loss, but not the information 
breach. Check if your email accounts have been compromised 
at www.haveibeenpwned.com

Same facts, but the settlement check was prepared for the client 
who showed up to get the check on time. But the crook had arrived 10 
minutes earlier and posed as her. Always have your staff ask for photo 
ID before they help a client to funds or information. The number one 
vehicle for phishing attacks is still email.

A paralegal at an immigration firm visits Facebook on her lunch hour. 
In a moment of glee, she clicks on a $75-off coupon for Bed Bath and 
Beyond and fills out the survey. Nothing happens. Later that day, a note 
appears on everyone’s screen: “All your files have been encrypted. To 
unencrypt them send $1,500 in Bitcoin to XXX by XXX date.” The firm 
pays the ransom, but the hacker doesn’t unencrypt the files. The firm is 
down for 10 days and struggles to fill its data holes.

A lawyer gets nominated for an award email. She calls because she 
knows clicking might not be safe. They interview her, asking about her 
life. She never hears back. She realizes they were mining her information 
(i.e. social engineering).

Cybersecurity attacks are constantly shifting. Train your staff to 
recognize scams and tell someone when things go wrong so the firm 
can address it effectively.
