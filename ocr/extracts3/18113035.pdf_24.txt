22) I Don’t Have to Track My  
Time Because …
“I don’t have to track my time because…”

…I do flat fee work.

…I do value-based billing.

…I can recreate my invoice from my emails, phone calls, and documents.

While these answers are common, they are myths. Always, always 
track your time, because of these facts:

Fact 1: You want to have a viable quantum merit claim if the client and 
you part ways before completion of the work for whatever reason. Make 
sure you can prove that you did work that should be paid for by being 
able to quickly present the tasks completed and converted to your 
hourly rate.

Fact 2: Most lawyers want to be able to explain to any court the 
precise time spent on a case if need arises. Whether it is to defend 
against, challenge, or prove a case for timely withdrawal, it is persuasive 
information to offer the court.

Fact 3: Your business needs the data. Hourly and flat fee attorneys need 
to know what types of cases are more profitable or less, who is paying 
or not, and make informed business decisions. Flat fee folks specifically 
need to be able to assess whether the fee is the correct amount. 
Everyone eats it on flat fees occasionally, but you need to be able to 
assess whether you are eating it more times than not. A way to do this 
is by determining what the hourly rate should be, measure how long a 
series of cases took, and divide the flat fee by the average time to see if 
it matches the goal hourly rate.

And the inefficiency in recreating a timesheet? It’s up there with using 
an abacus. Efficient time tracking is one touch to track, one touch to bill. 
Try making tracking as contemporaneous as possible.
