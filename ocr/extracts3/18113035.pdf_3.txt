AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      3

2) Six Sustainability Checks for a 
Harried Practice

This is a tough time to be an immigration lawyer. Advice you gave clients 
two years ago is now wrong. Years of jurisprudence is swept away. 
Things that were straight forward no longer are (e.g., asylum claims 
based on domestic abuse). Things that were tedious are tenfold tedious 
now (e.g., an RFE). Clients are more anxious than before. Colleagues have 
more mobility, and some are choosing to leave their firms to join another, 
go out on their own, or retire. Caseloads are bulging, either from having 
to pick up the cases of colleagues that left or accepting too many 
cases before realizing the case life cycle has grown longer. Appeals are 
more frequent. Many lawyers are putting in 16-hour days, seven days 
a week—something doable for a while but not forever. Some lawyers’ 
families are left feeling bereft and frustrated with their absent lawyer 
spouse or parent. Many of you are markedly exhausted. This increases 
potential for error. And longer, more difficult cases means more adverse 
results and disappointed clients.

Those who find meaning in these difficult times may feel a deep, fulfilling 
sense of purpose. But just as many may be thinking, There must 
be a better way. There may be. Though there isn’t one thing we can 
definitively say everyone should do, here are six common things that 
may make a difference:

Develop client information sheets. Use AILA resources like the Invisible 
Wall Report and your own data about how much longer cases take. Put 
the blame where it belongs and in context for your clients. Share them 
with all clients and constantly reiterate that cases take longer and have 
a less predictable result than they did two years ago, especially with 
clients who have touched the immigration system before. It is important 
to readjust expectations.

Reevaluate your flat/fixed fees. If cases take longer and you are 
charging the same amount, you are making less per case. Make sure it is 
still a livable, viable wage. If it is not, raise it on future cases or move to an 
hourly fee.

Prioritize case selection. Some think this means don’t take any more 
tough cases, and others think it means taking only clients who can pay. 
The truth is, it means all those things. Take the cases that best match 
the vision and mission of the law firm. That means clarifying the vision 
and mission and connecting each client to that purpose.

Hire help. You do not have to do everything yourself. If you are 
overworked, use freelance lawyers and paralegals, virtual receptionists 
and bookkeepers, or hire a full-time or part-time staff. Evaluate where 
you need the most help and start the process of hiring.

Talk with others. There is a woeful amount of isolation in the legal 
profession, made worse by long nights and piles of work that overwhelm 
and deflate morale. There is also no shortage of groups* who would 
benefit from your insight as much as you could benefit from the 
connection. But if you aren’t a joiner, be a starter. Start a group of maybe 
four to eight likeminded lawyers who meet weekly to discuss workload
