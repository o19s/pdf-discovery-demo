15) Understanding Chargebacks 
So You Can Protect Your IOLTA 
Almost everything about lawyers taking credit cards is swell. Lawyers 
get paid faster and more often when they take credit cards and clients 
like it too. The monies collected can be safely routed into a lawyer trust 
account, so there is no commingling of funds. The merchant account 
fees—the 2-3 percent charged by the credit card company—can either 
be considered part of the cost of doing business or charged to the client 
when the merchant account agreement permits—which is legal in all but 
10 states.

There is just one area of caution to be aware of: The Chargeback. A 
credit card chargeback is when the credit card holder thinks a charge 
is invalid or inappropriate and disputes it through the credit card 
company instead of the business, by simply stating, “I am not going 
to pay that charge.” In most situations the amount is then withdrawn 
from the account it was put into and an investigation is launched by the 
company. Sometimes the charge is still found to be valid and the money 
is put back into the seller’s account. Other times the payor “wins” their 
claim and doesn’t have to pay. This is a reasonable system that works in 
most circumstances.

But when those funds were put in a lawyer trust account, or IOLTA, 
the ramifications of a chargeback can be problematic for the lawyer. 
Chargebacks can be claimed on most credit cards up to 180 days after 
the purchase. That means a lawyer with an IOLTA could have collected 
an advance flat fee deposit, done the work, invoiced the client, waited a 
reasonable time for objection, and paid the firm out of the IOLTA by the 
time the chargeback occurs.

When the client says he won’t pay, the credit card processor generally 
pulls the funds from the account it went into without notice to the 
merchant. If that account was an IOLTA, best case scenario, the 
lawyer needs to replenish funds that belong to another client. Worst 
case scenario, it overdraws her IOLTA and her state’s disciplinary body 
contacts her to ask for an explanation of why she has insufficient funds 
and audits her IOLTA records. It is permissible in most states to only keep 
enough of the lawyer’s own money in the IOLTA to cover account and 
check fees. She shouldn’t have a buffer to protect client funds. So, what 
is the best course of action?

Use a credit card processor that will notify the firm of chargebacks 
before pulling the funds and pull the funds only from a designated 
account that is not the IOLTA. One such credit card processor is LawPay, 
which is an AILA member benefit. Just make a point to ask about this 
from the beginning and insist they set it up this way. Explain that the 
money in an IOLTA is not yours—it is still your client’s—and you have 
duties and obligations to protect it.

A chargeback hardly ever happens, but the one time it does could really 
make trouble for a firm. Know how chargebacks are processed with 
your credit card processor and protect your IOLTA and your professional 
reputation from this easy slip up.
