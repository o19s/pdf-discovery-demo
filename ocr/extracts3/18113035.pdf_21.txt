AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      21

18) Tips for Creating a Long-Term, 
Scalable IT Plan for Your Practice
As practices grow and become busier, your legal technology needs to 
scale with your practice to prevent glitches or inefficiency. When your 
legal technology and the way business is conducted don’t align, clients 
can suffer, along with the profitability of your firm. As we continue to see 
dramatic shifts in immigration policy, the number of clients in need of 
your help will continue to increase. Ensure that your IT plan is scalable 
in the long term to keep up with the increasing demand for your legal 
services.

Consider what’s important and where can you maximize. Take stock of 
the challenges your firm currently faces and identify IT solutions that 
can improve overall business function. 

Some common issues faced by law firms include:

•	 Complex invoicing cycles
•	 Difficulty with keeping track of, organizing, and accessing  

electronic files
•	 Inefficient onboarding of new hires to timely meet the  

demands of your growing practice

If these challenges remain unresolved for too long, they can seriously 
hurt your business. Consider hiring legal-specific consultants who can 
apply real-life experience to workflow processes and automation. As 
your practices grow, legal-specific IT consultants can also conduct 
IT trainings for new hires, lifting that burden off your shoulders. Many 
lawyers may attempt to handle their IT needs on their own, but this is 
not advised. Worrying about resolving IT issues should be the least of 
your concerns.

Revisit Your Budget

The minimum IT budget should cover hardware, software, and training 
and development services. Revisit your budget and anticipate the needs 
of your growing firm. Are you hiring a new associate? Do you have an 
adequate workstation equipped with the software and computer to 
meet the demands of their workload? If you are hiring additional staff, 
you may need to budget for purchasing more licenses for software, 
increasing training for new hires, and maintaining well-functioning office 
equipment to keep the work moving along smoothly.

With a combination of the right legal technology, up-to-date office 
equipment, and an efficient legal-specific IT consultant or full-time hire, 
you can maximize the efficiency of your practice and continue delivering 

excellent quality service to your clients.
