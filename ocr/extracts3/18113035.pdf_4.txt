and the current climate, in person or over video or phone. Stay in touch. 
Bond and commiserate. Do not let the frustration build up because it can 
do you harm.

Take care of yourself first. Put on your own oxygen mask first 
before assisting those sitting next to you. In this instance, that means 
recognizing what is sustainable and not overdoing things at the office for 
too long. That means going to the gym, the doctor, the museum, and the 
hockey game. Rejuvenate yourself in ways that work for you because 
no one else is going to call time-out here. And yes, you are being called 
upon to be the warriors of justice that all of us lawyers dreamed of being 
when we went to law school. The beast is at your door. The darkness is 
all around you in the arena. But us humans can’t live in the arena all the 
time. Step back, make time, and savor every weekend, every vacation, 
and every moment you get. Otherwise, you will run out of oxygen and 
not be able to help anyone.

3) Motivation and Its Link to  
Firm Culture 
A common belief in the business world is that only monetary rewards 
motivate. However, science disagrees. Daniel Pink* illustrates the 
disconnect between what science has found and what business 
believes in his popular TED Talk and subsequent book, Drive: The 
Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us. Being a lawyer (though he 
claims not a very good one), he makes a case that financial incentives, 
rather than motivate workers, actually disincentivize them and stunt 
their creativity. This occurs even when there are rudimentary cognitive 
requirements to the work they are doing.

Pink says that motivation is instead rooted in three things: autonomy, 
mastery, and purpose. He says that yes, fair pay is necessary (just to 
get that off the table), but that what actually motivates people is having 
the autonomy to continue to learn and master their craft and to feel that 
their work is rooted in purpose.

There is something to be said about consciously reflecting on why we 
do what we do.

Conclusions derived from consciously reflecting on one’s work can be 
used to boost individual or firm morale, to frame and improve firm culture, 
to revisit or revise the vision and the mission of the law practice, and 
to reinvigorate good feelings about the work we do. This is especially 
important when bad news seems to be the only news. Spend an hour 
answering these questions to the core of what motivates you and your 
staff:

What is the purposefulness of the work you do?

How does it change the world or make a difference?
