IDENTIFYING AND REPORTING FRAUD AND ABUSE 

PURPOSE: Provides guidance regarding the reporting of suspected instances of 
fraud in EOIR proceedings 

OWNER: Office of the Director 

AUTHORITY: 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.0(b),(e) 

CANCELLATION: None 

This policy memorandum is intended to remind EOIR employees to remain alert for fraud in our 
immigration proceedings and to act appropriately when suspected fraud is discovered. EOIR's 
mission is "to adjudicate immigration cases by fairly, expeditiously, and uniformly interpreting 
and administering the Nation's immigration laws." Application and benefit fraud in immigration 
proceedings erodes EOIR's ability to carry out that mission successfully. Accordingly, EOIR 
employees must remain vigilant and assertive regarding potential fraud and misrepresentation in 
order to protect the probity and fairness of all proceedings before the Office of the Chief 
Immigration Judge, the Board oflmmigration Appeals, and the Office of the Chief Administrative 
Hearing Officer. 

Fraud may occur in any immigration case, including asylum cases. As one federal court has 
observed,"[ c ]ases involving fraudulent asylum claims are distressingly common." Angov v. Lynch, 

788 F.3d 893, 902 (9th Cir. 2015), cert. denied 136 S. Ct. 896 (2016). The same court further 
described "an unfortunate reality that makes immigration cases so different from all other 
American adjudications: Fraud, forgery and fabrication are so common- and so difficult to 
prove-that they are routinely tolerated." Id. at 90 I. Although the administration of immigration 
laws may create "an environment where lying and forgery are difficult to disprove, richly rewarded 
if successful and rarely punished if unsuccessful," id., EOIR does not tolerate fraud or 
misrepresentation and should not contribute to any environment that would undermine the 
fundamental integrity of its proceedings.
