AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      14

11) Revise Representation 
Agreements to Reflect  
New Immigration Policies
AILA’s Practice and Professionalism Center is consistently hearing from 
members that many cases now take longer and require more work 
than just a few months ago. If you already track your time and review 
monthly reports to confirm you have the right flat/fixed fee for the work 
you are doing, this is already obvious to you. If you are not tracking time 
in each matter, you still have probably noticed cases take more effort 
and time to resolve.

When cases take longer and require more work, many lawyers are 
asking, “Can I adjust my fees to account for the additional effort, time, 
and responsibility?” After all, who should bear the additional burden? 
The Trump administration? You? Or your clients? So, how do you adjust 
flat/fixed fees already set with current clients? Without an escalator 
clause in your current agreement, it will be very difficult to do. It is a more 
complicated, important conversation that AILA’s Ethics Committee will 
address in the near future.

What about for new matters? Adjusting your representation agreement 
to reflect these new realities is key. Factors often considered include 
increased business costs (e.g., paralegal overtime), additional strategy 
efforts, added research to ascertain new solutions, increased 
stress from being whipsawed by rapidly changing policies, and your 
growing expertise resulting from new challenges. See Rule 1.5 of your 
jurisdiction’s Rules of Professional Conduct if you seek additional 
guidance.

Take time to review your entire model representation agreement to 
adjust the language too. Review the expectations clause (“No guarantee 
of results,” etc.) to make sure you are preparing clients for the present 
uncertainties. Also, review any dual representation language to be clear 
about who is or is not a client in light of the new NTA issuance policy. 
(If you are looking for a new model representation agreement, the AILA 
Practice & Professionalism Toolbox has a variety to fit your case mix.)

Only you can determine your flat or fixed fee for your clients. Be sure 
that amount reflects the effort required so you don’t become resentful 
of matters and clients based on a bad bargain. When that occurs, it puts 
you, your firm, and your other clients at risk. Make sure the flat fees you 
bargain for are good for everyone involved.
