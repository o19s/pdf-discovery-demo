AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      12

Your categories may be labeled by client name, case type, or still set on 
the defaults. To customize them see Create and assign color  categories.

Select the category you wish to make a Quick Step. For example, here 
we take the Important (dark red) category. Rename the Quick Step 
“Important” to match the category at the top where it says Name, by 
typing over Categorize message (otherwise you end up with several 
categorize message quick steps). You can even create a shortcut 
key at the bottom. The dropdown menu on Shortcut key starts with 
Ctrl+Shift+1 and ascends, but you can also tailor these to your own use.

The Quick Steps 
function is flexible and 
customizable as a 
series of steps. Which 
Quick Steps to create 
depends on the way 
your personal work 
flows. For example, 
your Quick Step could 
push the email to a 
follow-up folder, flag 
it, forward it to your 
supervising attorney 
for follow up with a 
flag for him next week, 
say FYI, and create 
an appointment with 
an attachment by a 
click of the mouse or Ctrl+Shift+5. A different click could send it to your 
receptionist with a subject line of, “please set appointment” and create 
a task so you follow up with her to know how it went and when the 
appointment could be scheduled for.

To choose what to Quick Step, think about what you do repetitively 
or struggle to keep on track, and see if there is some of that you can 
shirk onto Outlook to do for you. For example, if you frequently have 
appointment requests you send out and do not get a response, set a 
flag to follow up next week, or if you fail to prepare for meetings you set, 
create a task with a text message.

Two Small Warnings

Be wary of automatically putting something in a folder that you never 
test out your Quick Steps to make sure they work the way you want. 
Sometimes one thinks the steps work one way, but they end up being a 
little different when tested. Tweak accordingly.

Association Law Practice Management  and Technology How To… Video 
Library at Microsoft Office Category. A personal favorite is Use  Microsoft 
Outlook Add-ons for Productivity. A wealth of trainings for lawyer 
law office management can be had by all since the Director of CBA’s 
program, Catherine Sanders Reach, graciously opened the training files 
to the public recently.

Happy Quick Stepping. May the Gods of Efficiency smile upon you this 
day and all others.
