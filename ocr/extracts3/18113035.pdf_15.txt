12) Ten Hiring Missteps to Side 
Step in Your Next Big Hire
Hiring a new employee is a big endeavor—especially the first one. These 
are the top Ten mistakes the Practice & Professionalism Center finds 
immigration lawyers are making when hiring new employees.

In short, don’t do them:

Desperate hiring. Waiting too long to hire leads to desperation. It leaves 
no time to pick the right candidate or oversee and train a new employee 
right when it is most needed. Do not wait until you are utterly swamped 
to hire someone to share the workload.

Lazy hiring. Do not think anyone and their dog can do the job you have 
in mind. A law firm is a carefully tuned machine and everyone’s role is 
crucial. Value each position you hire for, and don’t take the first applicant 
that walks in the door for any of them.

Poorly describing the job. Ever get hired for one thing and find the job 
is something totally different? That is not great for the new employee, 
but it is also not great for the firm. Get the right fit by carefully analyzing 
needs and crafting the job description accordingly before even looking at 
candidates.

Under budgeting for the position. Competitive salary and benefits 
bring better talent. Low salaries and benefits may bring acceptable 
employees but won’t keep exceptional ones. It is as simple as that. This 
is not to say the only thing employees care about is money. Put the right 
salary range on a new position (based on market research) and add 
non-monetary perks like flex-time, teleworking, camaraderie lunches, and 
a superior firm culture to keep top talent.

No future in sight. The position you have may start with limited or no 
benefits, but it shouldn’t remain that way if you have a star employee. 

Similarly, talk about upward mobility and the future of the role from the 
very beginning. A receptionist can become a paralegal, bookkeeper, or 
office manager with the right training and performance. Likewise, does 
your associate have a clear understanding of what the partnership 
track is? Connect the dots for the new employee so it is easy for her to 
envision her future at the firm and follow the path to it.

Wrong questions in interview. Do not ask about religion, family 
obligations, past arrests, and personal information. Avoid things that 
could be construed by others as sexual harassment or prying. Honestly, 
we are lawyers! It’s unbelievable any of us do this, but we do.

No (or inconsistent) onboarding procedures. Ever start a job where 
you feel like you stepped into a tornado? When a new employee starts, 
it is crucial that they feel comfortable, welcomed, and excited about the 
place. Have a plan for how you ease them into the firm and stay with it.

Hiring doppelgangers. People like to hire people who look just like them. 
It’s a human condition, but it is not great for the workplace. A diversity 
of ages, views, and expertise makes firm culture fresh and relevant. To 
avoid hiring your twin, invite others onto the hiring team, ask identical 
questions in each interview, and intentionally place value in what is 
different from you.

Not checking references. Really check references! They do not always 
give you the full story for fear of being sued, so try to read between the 
lines and think about what is not said in the conversation. Speak to 
professional references and at least one prior supervisor. Check LinkedIn 
to see if the reference source is valid and impartial.

Not firing fast enough. If someone doesn’t work out, let them go. Do 
it humanely. Don’t march them out the door and act like they are a 
pariah. Keeping a bad employee, or one that performs well but is toxic, 
is awful for the culture of the firm. It sends a loud, undesirable message. 
The smaller the firm, the bigger the impact, so when you know it’s a bad 
fit, let them go quick.
