AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      25

23) Easy Time-Tracking Solutions
There are many ways to track time—all of them better than not tracking time at all. Lawyers who track time make more money because they capture 
more billable time and understand where it goes. Timekeeping systems are easy to set up and pay for themselves in increased revenue. Look at these 
timekeeping methods and see if one can fit into your law firm. or you can improve the method you currently use.

The overarching goal is contemporaneous timekeeping because the longer you wait to input, the more time is lost, and the more time-consuming 
tracking becomes. Not convinced yet? Start with the paper method for two weeks. Witness the added control and understanding over where the day 
goes and discover how much time you were missing. Then, choose a method/combination that fits your firm best, and double down on setting up the 
procedure.

Timekeeping Method Pros Cons Improvements

Use a legal pad to write down case, 
action, and time. (In “olden days,” lawyers 
would then give to secretary to input time 
into billing system.)

No connectivity required. 
Affordable and available. 
Easy to learn, implement.

Increases paper use. 
Prone to error and delayed entry. 
Inefficient reentry. 
Bulky. 
Single pad with many cases disorganized.

Create timesheet template and put in 
every case file. Fill it out religiously to 
minimize time loss and disorganization.

Electronic 
Same as above but entering it into a Word 
document or similar.

No connectivity required. 
Easy to learn. 
Easier reentry for billing. 
Affordable.

reports unlogged actions and asks where 
to log the time. 

Little training/changes. 
Further automation capabilities.

products. Automates tracking
