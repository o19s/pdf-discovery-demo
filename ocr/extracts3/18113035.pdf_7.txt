6) Multitasking Is the Enemy of 
Diligence

Model Rule 1.3, Diligence, reads, “A lawyer shall act with reasonable 
diligence and promptness” in client representation. It is a cornerstone of 
the legal profession. Comment 1 to MR 1.3 frames the responsibility thus:

A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf of a client despite 
opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer, 
and take whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to 
vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor. A lawyer must also act with 
commitment and dedication to the interests of the client and with 
zeal in advocacy upon the client’s behalf.

Lofty intentions that all lawyers strive towards. But the road to hell is 
paved with good intentions. Multitasking is the enemy of diligence. 
Multitasking came into vogue in the 1990s. Everyone put it on their 

résumé and juggled tasks at work to show off their ambidextrous brain 
power. People really believed it got the job done quicker.

Fast forward to today, where research shows only 2 percent of people 
can truly do multiple things at once and be good at it. That means 98 
percent can’t. When we try to, we are just switch-tasking—switching 
our attention from one task to another, instead of sharing that attention 
over several. With switch-tasking comes errors and slowness. Switching 
from task to task requires our brains to reorient time and again, slowing 
us down and causing us to make mistakes. Error rates increase by 50 
percent when workers are interrupted. Productivity goes down by as 
much as 40 percent, and stress goes up. And because brains mask 
the bumpy transitions from us, people who think they are excellent 
multitaskers are often the worst. Studies show that the average office 
worker loses 2.1 hours per day to distraction, mainly caused by the 
constant toggling between tasks.

Your Brain on Multitasking

For example, say you stop writing a motion to reopen for a client in order 
to answer the phone. You talk with the calling client for 15 minutes. When 
you hang up, you hear your email ping, so you answer a few of the most 
emergent and flag the others. Your secretary knocks on the door to 
ask about a client appointment later today. You come back around to 
your motion to reopen—your brain must expend valuable mental energy 
refocusing on each of these tasks, backtracking, and fixing errors. What 
a waste of time.

And there is a cost in creativity and innovative thinking, which can only 
come from the concentration extended timing focusing on the matter 
affords you. The law is a profession that requires the ability to follow an 
idea or thought down a long network of potential pathways. When you 
try to multitask, you struggle to get down those pathways far enough 
to find original arguments and analysis because you’re constantly 
switching and backtracking.
