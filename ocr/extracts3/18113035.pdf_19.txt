4 Steps to Claim Your Business on Google (and Improve SEO)

Marketing discussions are thick with social media and search engine 
optimization (SEO) talk these days. Online real estate is more valuable 
to many law practices than the physical address. The world isn’t 
changing—it has actually changed. Yet there are still some law firms who 
have not taken the minimal, easy steps to claim their business’ online 
profile with Google--essentially putting a pin on the business in Google 
Maps and Google’s search engine. There is probably no single action 
that helps your search results more than claiming the business’s online 
profile. 

Step 1: Create/Claim

Claim your business on Google for free, by going to Google My Business 
online to create a business profile or review its details. (If the profile is 
already claimed, request ownership.) Fill out Google’s form accurately 
and completely. If you have a virtual law office or share with other law 
offices, it can hurt SEO rankings if the location is pinned to more than 
one business, so use every detail of the address down to the suite 
number or mailbox. Put hours of operation, or by appointment only if 
there’s not standard office hours. Connect it to the website and add 
photographs of the location, parking, and front desk. The more a potential 
client can see exactly how to get there and what to expect, the better. If 
there are multiple locations, list them at manage locations.

Step 2: Verify

Once claiming is completed and double-checked, verify your business. 

Step 3: Mobile

Download the Google My Business application on your smartphone and 
work through the steps there. While you are there, check out some of 
the available analytics and client messaging feature you can use with 
Google My Business, while you are there. 

Step 4: Google Maps

The last step is to claim your business on 
Google Maps as well. Go to Google Maps 
on the desktop or phone application and 
search for your business. Below pictures, 
address, and phone, there is a “claim your 
business” if it is not claimed yet. 

Claiming your business is free, fast, and one of the best things you can 
do to raise your rankings on Google searches. It also makes it easier for 
potential clients to find your office and feel comfortable with making an 
appointment. It is a win-win-win, all around.
