AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      2

1) The Myth of Catching Up
“I’ll just stay at the office another hour to ‘catch up,’” you say. And when 
that isn’t enough time, you continue to stay at the office and then come 
in on weekends … all in the name of “catching up.” You have a beautiful 
to-do list—maybe it’s on a fancy spreadsheet—and as soon as you take 
something off, you put another (or many other) things on the list.

For immigration lawyers in the current political climate, with information 
being disseminated while we sleep, it is becoming a myth to stay 
“caught up.” What we really want is to be competent lawyers and not 
fall too far behind with our work.

Here are three tips to take back control of our time when we feel like we 
are being hit from all sides:

Prioritize: While it may seem like you need to be an expert on 
everything about immigration law and what area you specialize in, ask 
yourself what you need to know – and what can you research when 
necessary? Use your time wisely when you learn something new by 
stepping back, before you go down the rabbit hole. First, use reputable 
sources, such as AILA, to find out the latest “real” news relevant to 
immigration lawyers. Next, focus on going more in depth if you have 
related cases or if the news is in your specialty. Otherwise, simply take 
note and revisit this area of law if needed in the future.

Delegate: You’ve heard it before. With automation being in fashion, 
what can you get off your list using technology or other resources? 
Consider hiring other companies to help with your marketing, scheduling, 
accounting, and other non-lawyer tasks. Many companies are gearing 
themselves to small businesses and make it affordable to outsource 
these tasks to another person or through a user interface your clients 
would be happy to engage with.

Create a Routine: When we are chasing after what is coming at us, 
we truly will feel that we cannot catch up. Be intentional and realistic 
about what you can accomplish in a certain period of time. Schedule 
your days and weeks ahead, knowing that you will, of course, need 
to be flexible. Block out times in the day to work, play, and take care of 
yourself and your family. Consider making more significant adjustments 
to your life, if you cannot maintain a routine most of the time and if that 
is causing you stress.

Ultimately, life and law happen and in order to feel like the vibrant and 
sharp lawyers we are, we need to take charge of ourselves and stop 
chasing the myth of catching up.
