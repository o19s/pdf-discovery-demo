On June 22, 2017, EOIR’s Office of the Director issued a Memorandum, attached as Appendix A, 

reminding all EOIR employees of their responsibilities regarding suspected fraud and abuse and 

directing them to take action where warranted.  

On December 5, 2017, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions outlined for EOIR several principles, 

adherence to which ensures that the adjudication of immigration cases serves the national interest.  

Those principles include one regarding fraud in immigration proceedings: “The attempted 

perpetration of fraud upon the United States government in our immigration court system can lead 

to delays, inefficiencies, and the improper provision of immigration benefits.” Former Attorney 

General Sessions also directed that any and all suspected instances of fraud should be promptly 

documented and reported to EOIR management in accordance with applicable law. The 

memorandum from the former Attorney General is available at 

https://www.justice.gov/eoir/file/1041196/download. 

These policies remain in effect at EOIR, and all employees, especially those who have entered on 

duty after these policies were issued, should review them to ensure compliance. Fraud and 

misrepresentations have no place in immigration proceedings and will not be tolerated.  

To report issues of fraud or abuse, EOIR employees should contact the Fraud and Abuse 

Prevention Program at EOIR.Fraud.Program@usdoj.gov or (877) 388-3840. Complaints or 

questions may also be directed to Fraud and Abuse Prevention Counsel, Brea Burgie, at 

Brea.Burgie@usdoj.gov or (703) 756-8156. 

This PM is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to, create any right or benefit, 

substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States; 

its departments, agencies, or entities; its officers, employees, or agents; or any other person.  

Please contact your supervisor if you have any questions.
