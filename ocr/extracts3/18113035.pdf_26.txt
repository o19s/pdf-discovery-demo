AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      26

24) Coffee Shop Lawyering — 
Five Etiquette Tips for Working 
Anywhere Public
Don’t be a space hog. If alone, don’t nab the giant table and fill seats 
with your laptop bag and coat. Coffee shops are primo real estate for 
many professionals, students, and pedestrians. Aim to be a friendly and 
minimalist neighbor.

Mums the word. Besides the fact that no one wants to hear your loud 
work conversation, you also need to think about confidentiality. Plan 
your call times to coincide with private working areas or have the call 
in your car to protect client confidences and the concentration of your 
coffee shop colleagues.

Be tidy. Don’t be the coffee shop professional with a hundred cords 
tripping everyone on the way to the restroom. Only bring what you need 
and keep it simple. Along with being neat, don’t take the only electrical 
plugs in the coffee shop if you can help it. Charge your devices before 
you arrive, and only plug in if your device needs it.

Have WiFi, will travel. Come with WiFi solutions intact. Coffee house 
WiFi is not always strong enough for the work you have to do, nor is it 
secure enough to use unless you are plugged into your VPN network 
or other solutions for protection. Know how to turn your phone into a 
hotspot and secure it. If you are a frequent flyer at coffee shops, carry 
a portable private WiFi router and understand how to make it secure. 
If you are uncertain about your ability to do these things, limit your 
work to the innocuous and non-client related. For example, you could 
read AILA’s Practice Success Tips and Practice Advisories, delve into 
the Ethics Compendium, do legal research on AILALink and Fastcase, 
or strategize practice management issues without pulling up any client 
information.

Coffee shops aren’t for client meetings. Even when your client is a 
friend or suggests meeting at a coffee shop, and they are open and 
comfortable about their story, discussing their situation in a coffee shop 
is not ideal. The meeting can be interrupted or disturbed in unpredictable 
ways and many believe it doesn’t look professional enough. Further, it 
is the lawyer’s job to educate clients about the attorney-client privilege 
and confidentiality, and to protect those rights even if they don’t see 
the importance. Besides, there are other free or low-cost options with 
meeting rooms (e.g., libraries, court, college-campus meeting rooms, or 
renting office space by the hour). Find an alternative for a client meeting.
