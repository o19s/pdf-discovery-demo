AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      6

Stitch a new phone script. As a person who calls a ton of lawyers, I 
have heard the best and the worst. On the “worst-dressed list,” I have 
heard lawyers answer their own phone in an abrasive, distracted, 
“Hello?” sans introduction or name. I have heard answering services 
who honked, “law offices.” It’s time for a bit of classic customer service. 
Put together a pretty outfit that is the phone script—something personal 
to the firm, professional, and friendly. Get everyone on the same page. 
Something like, “Hello, this is Mary with Smith and Jones, immigration 
lawyers that care. How can I help you today?” Make it your own style, 
but snazzier.

Throw out the hand-me-down fee agreement. For some reason, fee 
agreements make the rounds. An associate leaves a firm and uses the 
old firm’s agreement or asks a mentor for his and adopts it to fit her 
purposes. It gets stale, has old, forgotten, raggedy clauses that don’t fit 
with the new fee arrangement, or says things in tense lawyer-speak—
the equivalent of musty tweed. Pull the old agreement out and shred 
it with the red pen. Or start all over. Look at the sample agreements 
in AILA’s Immigration Practice & Professionalism Toolbox to get ideas. 
Clauses that give lawyers the most trouble are scope of representation, 
costs, fees, and duties of lawyer to client and client to lawyer. Make 
sure you have clauses to resolve disputes with a third-party payor 
that discuss confidentiality and conflicts of interest where dual 
representation applies, and waivers are sufficient where applicable. And 
don’t forget the tone and feel of the agreement. Make sure it fits your 
law firm like a slick business suit—it should say you are professional, 
supremely competent, and confident.

These changes are much like those of a makeover show—they do not 
take long but they have a huge impact. Make an effort to update your 
firm and stay modern to be competitive.

5) Their Emergency Isn’t Yours 
(Until You Say It Is)
Potential clients can be extremely anxious. They can have impending 
deadlines and short timelines. They can have unrealistic expectations. 
Increasingly, there can be no good answers for their immigration issues. 
In the heat of the first conversation or consultation there is a temptation 
to make their problem your problem quickly and to adopt their sense of 
urgency.

But, hold up. It is easier to tell if a case is right for you with a little 
distance. When I was in practice, one potential client’s story simply 
brought me to my knees. I related to it so much personally and in the 
moment, I wanted to take the case on so badly. A couple hours later I 
realized it was too close to home. I would have had an impossible time 
emotionally detaching from the outcome. I passed.

After this, I implemented the Breathing Time Rule: Their emergency was 
not my emergency until I said it was. I had a script I implemented during 
consultations that went something like:

“I appreciate you coming in and sharing your situation so openly and 
honestly with me. Your case is important. I need to determine whether 
it is something I can do with my current case load. I’ll decide by noon 
tomorrow and I’ll call you to let you know my decision. If I decide to take 
the case, I’ll follow up with an emailed engagement letter, but I won’t start 
until you sign and date the form and return it to me with the retainer. If I 
decide I can’t take your case, I’ll refer you to other lawyers who may be 
available. I know this is a tight timeline, but this is my process.”

When their case was particularly emergent, I would promise a phone call 
“by noon tomorrow” and follow through. If they pressured me to ignore my 
better judgment after that, it told me more about them as a potential client. 
Create your own rules and scripts that match your goals and needs; and 
give yourself permission to take your time in signing up a client.
