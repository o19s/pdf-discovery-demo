AILA’S Top 25 Practice Success Tips of 2018      22

19) Making Unbreakable 
Passwords
The average computer user has 40 password-protected accounts but 
only uses about five different passwords on them. Everyone says we 
are not supposed to reuse passwords, but no one could remember 40 
passwords. So, here are some manageable solutions:

Use a password manager. LastPass, Dashlane, StickyPassword, 
and 1Password are examples of password managers that will create 
and store your passwords. Prices range from $12 to $40 per year. The 
right program will be easy to use, notify you of breaches and what 
passwords must be changed, and have two-factor authentication 
options. (LastPass was hacked, but no information was breached 
because their encryption worked.)

Use two-factor authentication (2FA). If you skip the password manager, 
at least use 2FA. This is easy to set up on most accounts. There are 
several types, the strongest being by application. The first time you log 
into an account, it will require a password and a randomly generated 
code that changes every minute. Once that device is “remembered,” 

it will not ask for the random code again (or rarely). Google 
Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator are common examples.

All devices should be password protected. Have an automatic lock and 
password on your work computer when it is inactive for a period. Do not 
keep passwords on your computer and do not keep old password reset 
emails after they are used.

Protecting your password goes beyond just firm data. It includes 
securing other accounts, such as your AILA account. Your password 
should be unique but easy for you to remember!

Finally, if you do reuse your favorite passwords, do not reuse the law firm 
passwords under any circumstance. Make a list of all your password 
protected sites and rate them by risk and security needs, then make a 
“never-reuse” list of the most sensitive ones.

20) Honing Your Phishing Radar
When it comes to protecting your firm and its clients, the best defense 
is a good offense. Use these cyberthreat educational tools (and beware 
of other free services that purport to be trainings in cybersecurity, as 
hackers actually use these as bait to get you to click on them.) Do not 
use other free sites without verification from an IT or cybersecurity 
specialist to educate yourself and your staff to avoid the pain of 
computer malware, hacks, scams, ransomware, and breaches:

Cisco’s OpenDNS has a Phishing Quiz that tests your ability to spot 
spoofed websites. Even a trained eye can miss things or not know the 
latest scams. Take the quiz to keep yourself sharp. After taking it, click on 
“find out why” to get concrete things to look for instead of guessing.

SonicWall also has a phishing IQ test and resources for learning more. 
(By the way, looking at their current attack map is utterly mesmerizing.)

Do Duo’s Phishing Assessment to determine vulnerabilities.
