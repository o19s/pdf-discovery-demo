It is often said that real estate is at the center of almost every financial crisis.  That 

is not quite accurate, for financial crises can, and do, occur without a real estate crisis.  

But it is true that there is a strong link between financial crises and difficulties in the real 

estate sector.1   In their research about financial crises, Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff 

document that the six major historical episodes of banking crises in advanced economies 

since the 1970s were all associated with a housing bust.2  Plus, the drop in house prices in 

a bust is often bigger following credit-fueled housing booms, and recessions associated 

with housing busts are two to three times more severe than other recessions.3  And, 

perhaps most significantly, real estate was at the center of the most recent crisis. 

In addition to its role in financial stability, or instability, housing is also a sector 

that draws on and faces heavy government intervention, even in economies that generally 

rely on market mechanisms.  Coming out of the financial crisis, many jurisdictions are 

undergoing housing finance reforms, and enacting policies to prevent the next crisis.  

Today I would like to focus on where we now stand on the role of housing and real estate 

in financial crises, and what we should be doing about that situation.  We shall discuss 

primarily the situation in the United States, and to a much lesser extent, that in other 

countries.

probability of a credit and house price boom being followed within three years by a recession is between 59 
and 67 percent, depending on the precise definition of a boom episode.

Housing and Government  

Why are governments involved in housing markets?  Housing is a basic human 

need, and politically important--and rightly so.  Using a once-popular term, housing is a 

merit good--it can be produced by the private sector, but its benefit to society is deemed 

by many great enough that governments strive to make it widely available.4  As such, 

over the course of time, governments have supported homebuilding and in most countries 

have also encouraged homeownership.5  

Governments are involved in housing in a myriad of ways.  One way is through 

incentives for homeownership.  In many countries, including the United States, taxpayers 

can deduct interest paid on home mortgages, and various initiatives by state and local 

authorities support lower-income homebuyers.  France and Germany created 

government-subsidized home-purchase savings accounts.  And Canada allows early 

withdrawal from government-provided retirement pension funds for home purchases.6   

And--as we all know--governments are also involved in housing finance.  They 

guarantee credit to consumers through housing agencies such as the U.S. Federal Housing 

Administration or the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.7  The Canadian 

government also guarantees mortgages on banks’ books.  And at various points in time, 

jurisdictions have explicitly or implicitly backstopped various intermediaries critical to 

the mortgage market.   

                                                 
4 The concept of a merit good is defined in Musgrave (1987).  Research suggests that homeownership is 
correlated with higher educational attainment (Aaronson 2000), community involvement (DiPasquale and 
Glaeser, 1999) and lower crime incidence (Rohe and Lindblad, 2013).    
5 An exception to the rule is Germany, where most government policies focus on subsidizing renting, not 
homeownership.  See Campbell (2013).

Government intervention in the United States has also addressed the problem of 

the fundamental illiquidity of mortgages.  Going back 100 years, before the Great 

Depression, the U.S. mortgage system relied on small institutions with local deposit bases 

and lending markets.  In the face of widespread runs at the start of the Great Depression, 

banks holding large portfolios of illiquid home loans had to close, exacerbating the 

contraction.  In response, the Congress established housing agencies as part of the New 

Deal to facilitate housing market liquidity by providing a way for banks to mutually 

insure and sell mortgages.8   

In time, the housing agencies, augmented by post-World War II efforts to increase 

homeownership, grew and became the familiar government-sponsored enterprises, or 

GSEs:  Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBs).  The GSEs bought 

mortgages from both bank and nonbank mortgage originators, and in turn, the GSEs 

bundled these loans and securitized them; these mortgage-backed securities were then 

sold to investors.  The resulting deep securitized market supported mortgage liquidity and 

led to broader homeownership.9   

Costs of Mortgage Credit  

While the benefits to society from homeownership could suggest a case for 

government involvement in securitization and other measures to expand mortgage credit 

availability, these benefits are not without costs.  A rapid increase in mortgage credit, 

especially when it is accompanied by a rise in house prices, can threaten the resilience of 

the financial system.  

                                                 
8 The National Housing Act of 1934 established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Federal 
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC).

One particularly problematic policy is government guarantees of mortgage-related 

assets.  Pre-crisis, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were viewed by 

investors as having an implicit government guarantee, despite the GSEs’ representations 

to the contrary.  Because of the perceived guarantee, investors did not fully internalize the 

consequence of defaults, and so risk was mispriced in the agency MBS market.  This 

mispricing can be notable, and is attributable not only to the improved liquidity, but also 

to implicit government guarantees.10  Taken together, the government guarantee and 

resulting lower mortgage rates likely boosted both mortgage credit extended and the rise 

in house prices in the run-up to the crisis.  

Another factor boosting credit availability and house price appreciation before the 

crisis was extensive securitization.11  In the United States, securitization through both 

public and private entities weakened the housing finance system by contributing to lax 

lending standards, rendering the mid-2000 house price bust more severe.12  Although the 

causes are somewhat obscure, it does seem that securitization weakened the link between 

the mortgage loan and the lender, resulting in risks that were not sufficiently calculated or 

internalized by institutions along the intermediation chain.  For example, even without 

government involvement, in Spain, securitization grew rapidly in the early 2000s and 

accounted for about 45 percent of mortgage loans in 2007.13  Observers suggest that 

Spain’s broad securitization practices led to lax lending standards and financial 

instability.14

Yet, as the Irish experience suggests, housing finance systems are vulnerable even 

if they do not rely on securitization.  Although securitization in Ireland amounted to only 

about 10 percent of outstanding mortgages in 2007, lax lending standards and light 

regulatory oversight contributed to the housing boom and bust in Ireland.15  

Macroprudential Policies  

To summarize, murky government guarantees, lax lending terms, and 

securitization were some of the key factors that made the housing crisis so severe.  Since 

then, to damp the house price-credit cycle that can lead to a housing crisis, countries 

worldwide have worked to create or expand existing macroprudential policies that would, 

in principle, limit credit growth and the rate of house price appreciation.16  

Most macroprudential policies focus on borrowers.  Loan-to-value (LTV) and 

debt-to-income (DTI) ratio limits aim to prevent borrowers from taking on excessive 

debt.  The limits can also be adjusted in response to conditions in housing markets; for 

example, the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England has the authority to 

tighten LTV or DTI limits when threats to financial stability emerge from the U.K. 

housing market.  Stricter LTV or DTI limits find some measure of success.  One study 

conducted across 119 countries from 2000 to 2013 suggests that lower LTV limits lead to 

slower credit growth.17  In addition, evidence from a range of studies suggests that 

decreases in the LTV ratio lead to a slowing of the rate of house price appreciation.18  

                                                 
15 See Task Force of the Monetary Policy Committee of the European System of Central Banks (2009) and 
Connor, Flavin, and O’Kelly (2012). 
16 See Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey (forthcoming). 
17 See Cerutti, Claessens, and Laeven (2017). 
18 See Crowe and others (2011); Duca, Muellbauer, and Murphy (2012); and Glaeser, Gottlieb, and 
Gyourko (2010).

However, some other research suggests that the effectiveness of LTV limits is not 

significant or somewhat temporary.19  

Other macroprudential policies focus on lenders.  First and foremost, tightening 

bank capital regulation enhances loss-absorbing capacity, strengthening financial system 

resilience.  In addition, bank capital requirements for mortgages that increase when house 

prices rise may be used to lean against mortgage credit growth and house price 

appreciation.20  These policies are intended to make bank mortgage lending more 

expensive, leading borrowers to reduce their demand for credit, which tends to push 

house prices down.  Estimates of the effects of such changes vary widely:  After 

consideration of a range of estimates from the literature, an increase of 50 percentage 

points in the risk weights on mortgages would result in a house price decrease from as 

low as 0.6 percent to as high as 4.0 percent.21  These policies are more effective if 

borrowers are fairly sensitive to a rise in interest rates and if migration of intermediation 

outside the banking sector to nonbanks is limited.   

Of course, regulatory reforms and in some countries, macroprudential 

policies--are still being implemented, and analysis is currently under way to monitor the 

effects.  So far, research suggests that macroprudential tightening is associated with 

slower bank credit growth, slower housing credit growth, and less house price 

                                                 
19 See Kuttner and Shim (2016) and International Monetary Fund (2014). 
20 For example, in 2016, the Norges Bank used house price appreciation as a criterion for raising its 
countercyclical capital buffer. 
21 Based on a range of estimates for banks’ cost of capital and for the elasticity of house prices with respect 
to interest rates.  See Macroeconomic Assessment Group (2010); Baker and Wurgler (2013); Hanson, 
Kashyap, and Stein (2011); and Van den Heuvel (2008) for a range of estimates for banks’ cost of capital.  
See Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2012); Glaeser, Gottlieb, and Gyourko (2010); and Rappoport (2016) 
for a range of estimates for the elasticity of house prices with respect to interest rates.

appreciation.  Borrower, lender, and securitization-focused macroprudential policies are 

likely all useful in strengthening financial stability. 

Loan Modification in a Crisis 

Even though macroprudential policies reduce the incidence and severity of 

housing related crises, they may still occur.  When house prices drop, households with 

mortgages may find themselves underwater, with the amount of their loan in excess of 

their home’s current price.  As Atif Mian and Amir Sufi have pointed out, this 

deterioration in household balance sheets can lead to a substantial drop in consumption 

and employment.22  Extensive mortgage foreclosures--that is, undertaking the legal 

process to evict borrowers and repossess the house and then selling the house--as a 

response to household distress can exacerbate the downturn by imposing substantial 

dead-weight costs and, as properties are sold, causing house prices to fall further.23   

Modifying loans rather than foreclosing on them, including measures such as 

reducing the principal balance of a loan or changing the loan terms, can allow borrowers 

to stay in their homes.  In addition, it can substantially reduce the dead-weight costs of 

foreclosure.  

Yet in some countries, institutional or legal frictions impeded desired mortgage 

modifications during the recent crisis.  And in many cases, governments stepped in to 

solve the problem.  For example, U.S. mortgage loans that had been securitized into 

private-label MBS relied on the servicers of the loans to perform the modification.  

However, operational and legal procedures for servicers to do so were limited, and, as a 

result, foreclosure, rather than modification, was commonly used in the early stages of 

                                                 
22 See Mian, Rao and Sufi (2013) and Mian and Sufi (2014). 
23 See Mian, Sufi, and Trebbi (2015) and Campbell, Giglio, and Pathak (2011).

the crisis.  In 2008, new U.S. government policies were introduced to address the lack of 

modifications.  These policies helped in three ways.  First, they standardized protocols for 

modification, which provided servicers of private-label securities some sense of common 

practice.  Second, they provided financial incentives to servicers for modifying loans.  

Third, they established key criteria for judging whether modifications were sustainable or 

not, particularly limits on mortgage payments as a percentage of household income.  This 

last policy was to ensure that borrowers could actually repay the modified loans, which 

prompted lenders to agree more readily to the modification policies in the first place.  

Ireland and Spain also aimed to restructure nonperforming loans.  Again, 

government involvement was necessary to push these initiatives forward.  In Ireland, 

mortgage arrears continued to accumulate until the introduction of the Mortgage Arrears 

Resolution Targets scheme in 2013, and in Spain, about 10 percent of mortgages were 

restructured by 2014, following government initiatives to protect vulnerable 

households.24  Public initiatives promoting socially desirable mortgage modifications in 

times of crises tend to be accompanied by explicit public fund support even though 

government guarantees may be absent in normal times. 

What Has Been Done?  What Needs to Be Done?  

With the recent crisis fresh in mind, a number of countries have taken steps to 

strengthen the resilience of their housing finance systems.  Many of the most egregious 

practices that emerged during the lending boom in the United States--such as no- or low-

documentation loans or negatively amortizing mortgages--have been severely limited.  

Other jurisdictions are taking actions as well.  Canadian authorities withdrew government 

                                                 
24 See Andritzky (2014).

insurance backing on non-amortizing lines of credit secured by homes.  The United States 

and the European Union required issuers of securities to retain some of the credit risk in 

them to better align incentives among participants (although in the United States, MBS 

issued by Fannie and Freddie are currently exempt from this requirement).  And post-

crisis, many countries are more actively pursuing macroprudential policies, particularly 

those targeted at the housing sector.25  New Zealand, Norway, and Denmark instituted 

tighter LTV limits or guidelines for areas that had overheating housing markets.  

Globally, the introduction of new capital and liquidity regulations has increased the 

resilience of the banking system.  

But memories fade.  Fannie, Freddie, and the Federal Housing Administration are 

now the dominant providers of mortgage funding, and the FHLBs have expanded their 

balance sheets notably.  House prices are now high and rising in several countries, 

perhaps as a result of extended periods of low interest rates.   

What should be done as we move ahead?   

First, macroprudential policies can help reduce the incidence and severity of 

housing crises.  While some policies focus on the cost of mortgage credit, others attempt 

directly to restrict households’ ability to borrow.  Each policy has its own merits and 

working out their respective advantages is important.  

Second, government involvement can promote the social benefits of 

homeownership, but those benefits come at a cost, both directly, for example through the 

beneficial tax treatment of homeownership, and indirectly through government 

assumption of risk.  To that extent, government support, where present, should be explicit 

                                                 
25 See Akinci and Olmstead-Rumsey (forthcoming).

rather than implicit, and the costs should be balanced against the benefits, including 

greater liquidity in housing finance engendered through a uniform, guaranteed 

instrument.  

Third, a capital regime that takes the possibility of severe stress seriously is 

important to calm markets and restart the normal process of intermediation should a crisis 

materialize.  A well-capitalized banking system is a necessary condition for stability in 

bank-based financial systems as well as those with large nonbank sectors.  This necessity 

points to the importance of having resilient banking systems and also stress testing the 

system against scenarios with sharp declines in house prices.  

Fourth, rules and expectations for mortgage modifications and foreclosure should 

be clear and workable.  Past experience suggests that both lenders and borrowers benefit 

substantially from avoiding costly foreclosures.  Housing-sector reforms should consider 

polices that promote efficient modifications in systemic crises.  

In the United States, as around the world, much has been done.  The core of the 

financial system is much stronger, the worst lending practices have been curtailed, much 

progress has been made in processes to reduce unnecessary foreclosures, and the actions 

associated with the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created some 

improvement over the previous ambiguity surrounding the status of government support 

for Fannie and Freddie.  

But there is more to be done, and much improvement to be preserved and built on, 

for the world as we know it cannot afford another pair of crises of the magnitude of the 

Great Recession and the Global Financial Crisis.
