 Thank you, Makada.  Good morning and let me also welcome everyone to the 

Seidman Center.  I am very pleased to join you today for this discussion, which 

highlights the important role that minority depository institutions (MDIs) and Community 

Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) play in their communities.  It is your 

presence in these communities and the services you offer that support local businesses, 

jobs, and economic growth.   

 I know this because before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a community 

banker in a small rural town and more recently served as Kansas’ State Bank 

Commissioner.  I understand what it means to try to meet the financial needs of a 

community, whose needs are varied and can present unique challenges to a credit 

underwriter.  I remember working with a customer on a mortgage loan for less than 

$20,000 with a first-time homebuyer’s credit to purchase a mobile home.  It was one of 

the most complicated and time consuming loans that I made during my time as a banker.  

Some larger banks might not be able or even be interested in putting that together, but 

community bankers know how important this kind of service is to their lower-income 

customers.  I’m proud to bring that perspective to the Federal Reserve Board as the first 

governor to fill the role designated for someone with community banking experience.  

 One way to fulfill my responsibilities is by meeting with and listening closely to 

minority and community bankers, consumers, small business owners, and local leaders—

all of the stakeholders with an interest in their communities.  MDIs and their staff play a 

key role, and I will use the knowledge we gain from these interactions to improve our 

work at the Federal Reserve. 

 We aim to help MDIs in three ways: by finding ways to ease your regulatory 

burden, by sponsoring valuable and actionable research on your contributions to your 

communities, and by seeking to better support you through outreach and hands-on 

technical assistance. 

 To achieve these goals, the Fed has developed an extensive outreach program, the 

Partnership for Progress (PFP).  The PFP helps MDIs confront business model 

challenges, cultivate safe banking practices, and compete more effectively in the 

marketplace—all topics that I expect will be addressed today. 

Regulatory Burden  

 One of the most important ways to help MDIs is by reducing regulatory burden.  

We are acting to implement provisions of a new law, S-2155, and reviewing comments 

on several proposals made in 2018 to ensure they do not unduly burden community 

banks.  Our community bank leverage ratio proposal would allow qualifying banks to opt 

out of a more complicated risk-based capital framework.  Other proposals include raising 

to $400,000 the threshold for when an appraisal is required for a residential real estate 

transaction and narrowing the Volcker rule to banks engaged in riskier activities.  We

raised the threshold from $1 billion to $3 billion in assets for banks that could qualify for 

an 18-month examination cycle.  Further, we raised the asset threshold to $3 billion for 

the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy 

Statement.  This change, which exempts small holding companies from consolidated risk-

based capital rules, fosters local ownership of small banks by allowing more banking 

companies with limited access to capital markets to use debt in bank acquisitions.  

With respect to supervision, the Federal Reserve continues to tailor and reduce 

burden by conducting portions of examinations offsite for community banks that prefer 

that option.  The Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program identifies low-risk or, 

conversely, high-risk activities within state member banks and appropriately streamlines 

or expands examination work programs commensurate with the identified risk.  This 

minimizes the burden for banks that are well managed and directs supervisory resources 

to higher-risk activities where they are most needed.   

 Related to regulatory burden is an important initiative, in concert with the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation, to identify healthy minority banking organizations 

capable of acquiring or merging with MDIs in troubled condition.  Our PFP team has 

assisted with the process for establishing new MDIs and worked with MDIs to identify 

advantageous federally sponsored programs with which to collaborate.  I note that 

today’s agenda includes a session on this topic.

Research 

The Board and Reserve Banks also conduct valuable research on the impact of 

MDIs on underserved households and communities.  Last November, we held a webinar, 

which I hope some of you were able to participate in, on recent research on MDIs.  All of 

our MDI research is available on the Partnership for Progress website.  The PFP 

continues to seek to sponsor high-quality research to enhance our understanding of the 

MDI business model and how MDIs serve their communities.  We welcome your input 

on research topics you find interesting and helpful.   

Tech Assistance/Outreach 

 Through this biennial conference and several PFP conferences and outreach 

events each year, the Federal Reserve facilitates networking among MDI institutions.  

District coordinators from each Federal Reserve Bank will serve on local exam teams 

during examinations, and collect feedback from MDIs on how the PFP can provide 

additional assistance. District coordinators meet regularly with MDI management to 

discuss emerging issues and provide technical assistance, especially to those in troubled 

condition, to explain supervisory guidance, discuss challenges, and respond to 

management concerns and inquiries. High-interest items include the Community 

Reinvestment Act, IT and cybersecurity, concentrations in commercial real estate,

interest-rate risk, capital planning and rules, anti-money-laundering compliance, and 

third-party vendor management.  We want to help MDIs navigate supervisory and 

regulatory requirements.  To do that well, we want to continue to develop an open 

dialogue so we can better understand the challenges you face and how we can best help 

you wherever we have the ability to do so. 

 Personal contact and relationship building are important to community banking 

and, I believe, also to community bank oversight.  We want, and need, to hear your 

questions and concerns.  Last April, we invited the leaders of all Fed-supervised MDIs to 

a Leaders Forum so we could spend a day and a half building relationships and talking 

about the needs of MDIs.  We also encourage staff to reach out to MDIs and ensure that 

you are aware of our outreach meetings and research.  Let’s keep this communication 

going.  We engage is these efforts because your institutions are vital to your communities 

and to the American economy.  On behalf of the Federal Reserve, I’d like to once again 

thank you for the work you do in your communities and welcome you to this year’s 

conference.
