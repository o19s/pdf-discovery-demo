Opening Remarks  

by 

 Daniel K. Tarullo   

Member  

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Outreach Meeting 

Arlington, Virginia 

 December 2, 2015 



 On behalf of the Federal Reserve Board, let me join my colleagues from the other bank 

regulatory agencies in welcoming you to this sixth and final outreach meeting being held as part 

of the interagency review process under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork 

Reduction Act (EGRPRA).  As you know, EGRPRA requires the federal banking agencies to 

conduct a decennial joint review of our regulations to identify those that are outdated, 

unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.   

At the third outreach meeting this past spring, I suggested that we could regard the 

EGRPRA review as a success only if it leads to significant reduction in regulatory burden for 

smaller banks.  Over the course of this year, there has been a wide range of comments on a wide 

range of regulatory practices.  But many have been concentrated in what are obviously a few key 

areas of concern to smaller banks.  These include simplifying the regulatory capital rules for 

smaller community banks; modifying the information collected by Consolidated Reports of 

Condition and Income, the so-called “Call Report”; and updating certain regulations and 

supervisory practices under the Community Reinvestment Act to reflect current banking 

practices.   

First, many commenters have urged a change regarding the application of the Basel III 

capital requirements to community banks.  They have argued that simpler capital rules are 

needed to reduce the compliance burden for smaller institutions because it is disproportionate to 

the benefits of the framework’s increased risk sensitivity.  The greater detail of the Basel III 

framework requires a degree of categorization, recordkeeping, and reporting that can be 

particularly costly for smaller community banks.  As I have publicly stated before, I believe that 

it is possible to develop a simpler set of capital requirements for smaller banks that will be

consistent both with the safety and soundness aims of prudential regulation and with our 

statutory obligations such as the Collins Amendment.    

Second, commenters have called for changes to the Call Report.  The Call Report is filed 

quarterly and used by regulators to monitor the safety and soundness, performance, and risk 

profile of each institution and to assess the condition of the banking system.  Many of the 

comments have advocated modifying the types and amounts of information collected by the 

report for community banks to align more closely with the relatively straightforward business 

models of these firms.  

Here, I am pleased to say, the federal banking agencies have not waited for the end of the 

EGRPRA comment process to respond.  In September, we published proposals that would 

streamline and simplify regulatory reporting requirements for community banks arising from the 

Call Report.  These proposals, published under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions 

Examination Council, would eliminate or revise several Call Report data items.  The proposals 

complement other efforts aimed at lessening burden associated with the Call Report.  These 

efforts include accelerating the start of a statutorily required review of the appropriateness of the 

data items collected by the Call Report, evaluating the feasibility and merits of creating a 

streamlined version of the Call Report for community banks, and holding teleconferences and 

webinars to explain reporting requirements and any upcoming changes.  As we complete the 

EGRPRA review process, we will certainly consider other opportunities for change.  

Third, commenters have made recommendations as to how regulations and supervisory 

practices implementing the Community Reinvestment Act should be modernized to reflect the 

ways that banking services are now being provided and that banks are interacting with the 

communities they serve.  Some commenters have requested that the regulations’ asset thresholds, 


- 3 - 
 

which are used to determine the examination method for banks of different sizes, be raised.  

Others have asked for cost-saving procedural changes, such as updating the requirement to 

maintain hard copies of a bank’s public file so as to reflect changes in technology.  Here again, I 

believe there should be ways the federal banking agencies can be responsive to this set of 

concerns.   

 As this is the last outreach meeting of this EGRPRA process, I think it useful to add that 

we are committed to a systematic analysis and consideration of all the comments that we receive.  

This will allow us to prioritize recommendations and act as quickly as possible to adopt them.  It 

is in that spirit of creating priorities for action that I identified those three areas that have 

commanded attention from so many commenters.   

Thank you again for your participation in today’s session.  I look forward to hearing your 

views.
