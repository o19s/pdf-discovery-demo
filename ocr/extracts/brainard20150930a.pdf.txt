I would like to thank the event organizers for inviting me to participate in this 

year’s Community Banking Research and Policy Conference.  Supporting the health and 

vitality of America’s community banks is an important priority for me.  Community 

banks have long been a central provider of finance to Main Street America.  Despite the 

challenging environment of the past several years, community banks have continued to 

play a significant role in a number of key market segments.   

Today I want to focus on one of the most important of those segments--the 

provision of credit to small businesses--and to explore how the traditional role of 

community banks may be affected by the growing role of online lenders.  Some view the 

growth of online platforms as a challenge to community banks in their traditional core 

businesses.  But it is also possible that the very different strengths of community banks 

and online lenders could lead to complementarity and collaboration in the provision of 

credit to small business while recognizing there are important risks that must be managed 

by banks and borrowers.  By working together, lenders, borrowers, and regulators can 

help support an outcome whereby credit channels are strengthened and the possible risks 

are being proactively managed. 

Small Businesses, Small Business Credit, and the U.S. Economy 

Small businesses make up a large and vitally important segment of the U.S. 

economy.  And their vitality hinges centrally on their access to credit. 

More than three-fourths of American businesses have fewer than 10 employees 

and another nearly one-fourth have between 10 and 500 employees.1  In addition to 

                                                 
I am grateful to Robin Prager for her assistance in preparing this text.

constituting the vast majority of firms in the United States, small businesses account for 

about one-half of private-sector employment.2  And small firms, especially new small 

firms, are an even greater source of net new jobs in our economy.3  Thus, ensuring that 

creditworthy small businesses have access to credit is vitally important. 

Discussions of small businesses, along with their credit needs, often fail to 

appreciate the tremendous heterogeneity that exists among these firms and, consequently, 

the variation in their credit needs.  Small businesses include plumbers and electricians, 

medical and dental offices, dry cleaners and hair salons, restaurants and bodegas, as well 

as growth-oriented tech start-ups and small manufacturers.  They range in size from 

having zero employees--which accounts for a very large share of small businesses--to the 

much smaller share of small businesses with a few hundred employees.  Although some 

small businesses aspire to grow quickly, many others are unlikely to grow much at all.  

While some have audited financial statements, most small businesses do not.  Some have 

assets that can be pledged as collateral, but many do not.  Some have a long history of 

solid, profitable performance, while others have short histories or a mixed track record 

with regard to profitability.   

Not surprisingly, there is also considerable variation in the credit needs of small 

businesses.  Some small businesses, particularly very small firms in knowledge or service 

industries, may have little or no need for credit.  Larger small businesses, and those that 

require a substantial amount of equipment or need to hold sizeable inventories, tend to 

have greater credit needs.  Among small businesses that do need credit, funds may be

required for managing cash flow, for purchasing or maintaining property or equipment, 

for building inventory, or for expanding operations.  Depending on the needs, firms may 

be interested in term loans, capital leases, lines of credit, or credit card loans.  The 

characteristics of a small business and the nature of its credit needs influence the type of 

lender that is best suited to meeting those needs. 

Community Banks and Small Business Lending 

Community banks have long been a primary source of credit for small businesses 

and today may continue to have the best business model for fulfilling many small 

business credit needs.4  But changing technology has led to increased competition in this 

product space from both larger banks and, in recent years, alternative lenders.   

Large banking organizations ramped up their small business lending between 

2003 and 2008.  Although they pulled back from this market segment in the wake of the 

financial crisis, their small loans to businesses have been gradually rising since 2011.  

Meanwhile, community banks experienced very modest growth in small loans to 

businesses during the pre-crisis period, followed by a decline from 2009 through 2013 

and a subsequent leveling-off.  Consequently, community banks’ share of the dollar 

volume of outstanding small loans to businesses at commercial banks has declined over 

the past decade.5  Despite this decline, community banks continue to hold about 

50 percent of outstanding small business loans at commercial banks, far in excess of 

their 20 percent share of commercial banking assets and deposits.6   

                                                 
4 For purposes of this talk, I define a community bank as a bank with less than $10 billion in assets, which 

is either independent or part of a banking organization that also has less than $10 billion in assets. 
5 Small loans to businesses are loans to businesses with initial principal amounts of less than $1 million. 
6 Data on bank assets, deposits, and small loans to businesses were compiled from Consolidated Reports of 

Condition and Income, also known as Call Reports, that banks file with the Federal Financial Institutions 


 - 4 - 

To understand the continued strong role played by community banks, it is helpful 

to look at the differences in small business lending between large and small banks.  

Although large banks and small banks now provide about equal dollar volumes of small 

loans to businesses, they tend to provide different types of loans to different types of 

borrowers, using different underwriting methods.  On the one hand, large banks generally 

have some advantages in the provision of transaction-based lending--that is, lending that 

relies on hard or quantitative information such as financial ratios, collateral, or credit 

scores.  Small banks, on the other hand, have advantages in the provision of relationship-

based lending--lending based on context-specific or qualitative information, such as the 

owner’s character and reliability and the needs of the community.  

When we use Call Report data to break down commercial banks’ loans to 

businesses by loan size, it is striking that most of the erosion in community banks’ share 

over the past decade has been concentrated among the very smallest loans--those with 

initial principal amounts less than $100,000.  Among these so-called micro loans, the 

share held by large banks grew from 42 percent in 2005 to 67 percent in 2015.  In 

contrast, large banks’ share of larger outstanding small loans to businesses--those with 

initial principal amounts between $100,000 and $1 million--grew much more modestly, 

from 39 percent to 43 percent, over the same time period.  Business micro loans are 

typically underwritten based, primarily or exclusively, on credit scores because the small 

loan size makes it unprofitable to produce such loans using more costly traditional 

underwriting methods.  Thus, the growth in large banks’ share of micro business loans is 

                                                 
Examination Council.  Data on banks’ small loans to businesses are widely used to proxy for bank loans to 

small businesses because data on the latter are not collected.

likely attributable to their ability to benefit from economies of scale in credit-score-based 

lending.   

Business loans with principal amounts between $100,000 and $1 million are 

generally not underwritten solely on the basis of credit scores--probably because lenders 

are not willing to incur the risk associated with larger loan amounts without the benefit of 

a traditional underwriting approach.  For these larger loans--and for smaller loans where 

the borrower does not qualify based on credit score alone--community banks are often the 

lender of choice.  Their local knowledge and close ties to the communities they serve 

enable community bankers to establish a deep understanding of local businesses that 

allows them to prudently provide credit to borrowers who might not otherwise be 

considered creditworthy.  A number of empirical studies confirm that relationships are 

important factors influencing both the availability and the terms of loans to small 

businesses.7   

Similarly, when we slice the Call Report data to separate commercial and 

industrial (C&I) loans from commercial real estate loans, we see that while community 

banks’ share of outstanding small C&I loans dwindled from about 54 percent in 2005 to 

40 percent in 2015, their share of small commercial real estate loans has remained 

relatively stable, moving marginally from 66 percent to 63 percent.  Community bankers’ 

intimate knowledge of their communities and their familiarity with local economic 

conditions provide an advantage relative to large, geographically dispersed banks in 

underwriting commercial real estate loans.   

                                                 
7 Examples of such studies include Petersen and Rajan (1994), Berger and Udell (1995), Cole (1998), 

Berger and others (2005), and Cole and others (2004).   


 - 6 - 

Since large banks are unlikely to become as knowledgeable about local economic 

conditions or as adept at small business relationship lending as community banks, there 

may be some limits to their expansion in this segment of lending. 

Online Alternative Lenders 

In recent years, online alternative lenders have also made inroads into small 

business lending.  There has been a lot of speculation about the effect of this sector on 

traditional banks:  Will it disrupt their activities, broaden their reach, or maybe a little of 

both?   

Focusing specifically on nonbank alternative online lenders or online marketplace 

lenders, it is important to underscore that the online space is highly dynamic, with a 

number of business models emerging and evolving.  I will touch on two business models 

in particular, recognizing that as these business models are tested, it is likely that some 

will prove more successful than others, and that some may adapt in ways that will cause 

us to revise our segmentation of online alternative lending.8  First, online balance sheet 

lenders generally use their own capital to fund small business credit products that are 

originated either directly on their platforms or indirectly through brokers or referral 

                                                 
8 As the industry has evolved, alternative online lenders have increasingly been referred to as marketplace 

lenders, a term that helps emphasize the growing institutional investor base of the sector.  So while peer-to-

peer lenders initially allowed individual borrowers to connect with individual lenders, individual lenders 

increasingly are being replaced by institutional investors who are turning to online marketplace lenders for 

investment opportunities.  Because some balance sheet lenders are now originating small business loans for 

institutional investors to purchase, balance sheet lenders are also often referred to as marketplace lenders. 

In the Treasury Department’s recent Request for Information, they defined online marketplace lending as 

“the segment of the financial services industry that uses investment capital and data-driven online platforms 

to lend either directly or indirectly to small businesses and consumers.” (See U.S. Treasury, 2015, p. 6.)

partnerships.9  Credit products offered by these lenders are usually short term and include 

loans, lines of credit, or cash advances.10   

Second, peer-to-peer lending platforms, by contrast, act as intermediaries to 

connect borrowers with lenders and to assist investors in identifying and purchasing loans 

that meet their investment criteria.  These lenders can be individuals, banks, or 

institutional investors.11   

Although data are limited on this sector, the data that are available suggest that 

the various types of online alternative lenders have captured a small but rapidly growing 

share of lending since the financial crisis.  In aggregate, the outstanding portfolio 

balances of these lenders have doubled every year since the mid-2000s.12  It is estimated 

that online alternative lenders originated $12 billion in 2014, with unsecured consumer 

loans representing $7 billion and small business loans accounting for approximately 

$5 billion.13  While this amount represents only a small fraction of U.S. unsecured 

consumer and small business lending overall, the rate of growth is notable.  

Much of the growth in online alternative lending has been supported by 

innovative uses of technology that allow lending platforms to streamline and automate 

loan applications, expedite underwriting and quickly price risk, and provide loan 

applicants with quick loan decisions and access to funds.  Online alternative lenders use 

algorithms to provide rapid decisions on loan applications, often taking into account 

                                                 
9 Online balance sheet lenders include companies such as OnDeck, Square Capital, Fundation, 

CAN Capital, Kabbage, and PayPal Credit. 
10 Cash advances, sometimes known as merchant cash advances, capital advances, or business cash 

advances, are credit products that allow businesses to convert future credit card or payment account 

receivables into capital (Lipman and Wiersch, 2015).  
11 Peer-to-peer lending platforms include companies such as Prosper, Lending Club, and Funding Circle. 
12 See Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 42). 
13 For information on online alternative lenders, see U.S. Treasury (2015, p. 6); for more on unsecured 

consumer loans and small business loans, see Morgan Stanley Research (2015).

information from a wide range of sources that are not typically involved in bank 

underwriting of loans.  For example, aggregated information for small business 

underwriting may include data on online banking, accounting, bookkeeping, credit card, 

shipping, supplier, and social media.  So, while traditional banks often focus on personal 

credit scores for underwriting consumer loans and the majority of small dollar, small 

business loans, online alternative lenders may analyze a broader variety of data to 

develop different metrics to measure and price loan risk.  Currently, the largest platforms 

typically offer online or mobile applications that allow consumers and small business 

owners to easily submit information and aggregate vast amounts of data to complete loan 

applications. 

Although rates vary by platform and borrower characteristics, when taking into 

account origination fees and repayment periods, the average annual cost of borrowing,   

or APR, associated with loans and credit products offered by online alternative small 

business lenders tend to be higher than those associated with traditional bank products.14  

Reports suggest that some borrowers are willing to pay a higher price in exchange for an 

easy application process, a quick decision, and rapid availability of funds.15   

While some see online alternative lenders as a disruptive threat to traditional 

lenders, banks increasingly are finding ways to partner with online alternative lenders, 

including through loan purchases and referral agreements.  Loan purchases by 

community banks of loans originated by online alternative lenders have been focused on 

                                                 
14 For example, Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 44) note that many alternative lending platforms charge 

yields ranging from 30 to 120 percent of the loan value, depending on the size, term duration, and risk 

profile of the loan.  Several alternative online lenders advertise lower rates, but industry sources note that 

lending is rarely done at those rates.   
15  For example, see Clark (2014), Cortese (2014), Crowley (2015), and Mills and McCarthy (2014, p. 46).

unsecured consumer debt.  As the percentage of unsecured consumer debt outstanding 

held by community banks has been declining in recent years, several banks have 

partnered with online alternative lenders to grow and diversify their portfolios of 

unsecured consumer debt.16 

In contrast to the consumer loan activity, the small business partnerships that have 

developed so far are largely fee-based referral partnerships.  In these partnerships, banks 

refer to online alternative lenders some of their small business customers who are usually 

seeking loan amounts that the referring banks may see as too costly to underwrite and 

service, particularly in the size range below $100,000.17  For example, in 2014, OnDeck 

announced small business loan referral partnerships with BBVA Compass and with the 

ProfitStars Lending Network, part of the Independent Community Bankers of America 

Preferred Service Provider program.  

Another type of partnership that has been announced recently involves alternative 

online lenders and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that seek to 

provide loans to low-income and underserved borrowers and neighborhoods.  These 

partnerships may enable the CDFI to use the online lender’s technology platform at no 

                                                 
16 In 1994, banks and thrifts with less than $10 billion in assets held about 69 percent of U.S. consumer 

loans, according to an analysis of regulatory filings by SNL Financial.  That share dropped to 19 percent in 

2004 and 9 percent in 2014 (Tracy, 2015).  Recently, BancAlliance, a consortium of approximately 200 

community banks, has partnered with Lending Club to purchase consumer loans originated on Lending 

Club’s platform and the Western Independent Bankers, a consortium of more than 160 independent and 

community banks, have entered into a partnership with Prosper to encourage member banks to use 

Prosper’s platform to facilitate consumer loans for their customers.  Also, Lending Club and Citi 

Community Capital, the community development lending and investing division of CitiGroup, recently 

announced a partnership to facilitate up to $150 million in consumer loans designed to provide more 

affordable credit to underserved, lower-income borrowers in low- and moderate-income communities.  
17 As an indication of the demand for small dollar loans on the part of small businesses, the Joint Small 

Business Credit Survey conducted in 2014 by the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Atlanta, Cleveland, 

and Philadelphia found that more than one-half of small business loan applicants sought $100,000 or less in 

credit.  (For more information, the survey report is available at www.newyorkfed.org/smallbusiness/SBCS-

2014-Report.pdf.)

cost or for a reduced cost in order to make underwriting decisions faster and more cost 

effective.18  These partnerships are still in the early stages. 

Risks and Opportunities 

Across the Federal Reserve System, we are actively following developments in 

the alternative online lending space and have engaged with several alternative online 

lenders over the past few years to learn more about the industry, the technology, and the 

business models as well as engaging with bankers to understand how these developments 

are affecting their markets.19  Most recently, several alternative lenders have participated 

in events where we have joined with community development finance experts to discuss 

ways to adopt platform lending technology to better serve low- and moderate-income 

borrowers and small business owners.20   

We want to better understand the opportunities presented by technological 

advances that may bring new data to bear and help lenders make available credit to a 

                                                 
18 For example, in June 2015, Lending Club and the Opportunity Fund, a California-based CDFI 

microenterprise lender, announced a partnership intended to provide $10 million in loans over a period of 

five months to 400 small businesses in underserved areas of California (for more information, see  

www.opportunityfund.org/media/blog/clinton-announces-partnership-between-opportunity-fund-and-

lending-club).  In 2012, the Association for Enterprise Opportunities (AEO) launched the TILT Forward 

platform, an online lending platform that is powered by OnDeck’s technology and can be used by AEO’s 

network of nonprofit community lenders and other community-based organizations to reach underserved 

entrepreneurs (more information is available at www.tiltforward.com). 
19 In April 2014, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York hosted “Filling the Gaps:  Summit on Small 

Business Credit Innovations.” and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco will be hosting the 

Consumer Financial Services Revolution in November 2015. 
20 For example, in March 2014, the Board and the Federal Reserve Banks of New York and San Francisco 

convened a small group of thought leaders for a discussion on the challenges and opportunities presented 

by crowdfunding investments as a significant source of capital for the community development industry; 

and in March 2015, we cohosted the Financial Innovations Roundtable with the University of New 

Hampshire’s Carsey School of Public Policy and brought together representatives from banks, CDFIs, 

mission-driven lenders, and small business online alternative lenders to talk about opportunities for 

collaboration, the challenges of scaling up small business lending, and potential consumer and safety and 

soundness regulatory issues facing partnerships between regulated financial institutions and alternative 

online lenders. As the sector grows and evolves, we will continue to monitor the development of online 

alternative lenders and the risks and opportunities that they may have for a range of stakeholders.

more diverse set of small business borrowers.  In some cases, partnerships between 

community banks and online platforms may help expand access to credit for consumers 

and small businesses, and help banks retain and grow their customer base.   

As regulators, we also want to help the various stakeholders anticipate and 

carefully manage the associated risks.  Of course, third-party and vendor risks are factors 

that banks should always take into account when introducing new products and services.  

Taking the time to identify and mitigate risks is a prudent step that banks can take to 

avoid unintended consequences when entering into partnership agreements with 

alternative online lenders.  In addition, banks should consider whether the partnerships 

provide new opportunities to diversify their portfolios if they are purchasing loans, and 

whether the partnerships provide opportunities to offer new products that are a good 

strategic fit for their bank and their customers.21   

It is also important for banks to carefully consider regulatory compliance.  When 

purchasing consumer loans originated by online alternative lenders, banks should 

examine whether fair lending or unfair or deceptive acts or practices issues result from 

the origination and underwriting methods used by online alternative lenders.22  To the 

extent that the underlying algorithms used for credit decisionmaking use nontraditional 

                                                 
21 If a bank is considering a referral partnership, the following questions could help identify potential risks:  

Do existing customers have a need for the product or are there less expensive products that would better 

serve borrower’s needs?  Are the features, risks, and terms of the products offered through the referral 

program explained clearly and conspicuously, or are they buried in a lengthy document full of “legalese” 

that makes it difficult for borrowers to make a truly informed choice?  Finally, are the products offered 

through the referral partnership consistent with what would be recommended to a family member?  (See 

Curran, 2013.) 
22 There are several regulatory compliance-related questions that banks should consider.  For example, have 

the loans offered or the lending platform to be partnered with been reviewed for compliance with 

applicable federal and state laws?  Have the loans originated by the partnering lending platform been 

reviewed from a consumer fairness standpoint?  When assessing referral partnerships, have any issues been 

identified that would lead to disparate treatment of customers if banks selectively refer customers to online 

alternative lending partners?  (See Federal Reserve System Community Banking Connections Advisory 

Board, 2014). 


 - 12 - 

data sources, it will be important to ensure that this does not lead to disparate treatment or 

have a disparate impact on a prohibited basis. 

Aside from these risks, banks should consider a variety of others, including the 

implications of credit risk stemming from the purchase of loans and reputational risk if 

referrals to online alternative lending platforms end badly. 

The risks I have described so far have primarily been from the perspective of 

banks considering partnerships with online alternative lenders.  Another important set of 

concerns are focused on the small business borrowers who may be considering online 

alternative loans.  Some have raised concerns about the high APRs associated with some 

online alternative lending products.  Others have raised concerns about the risk that some 

small business borrowers may have difficulty fully understanding the terms of the various 

loan products or the risk of becoming trapped in layered debt that poses risks to the 

survival of their businesses.  Some industry participants have recently proposed that 

online lenders follow a voluntary set of guidelines designed to standardize best practices 

and mitigate these risks.23  It is too soon to determine whether such efforts of industry 

participants to self-police will be sufficient.  Even with these efforts, some have 

suggested a need for regulators to take a more active role in defining and enforcing 

standards that apply more broadly in this sector. 

No doubt, ongoing technological advances and the evolving competitive lending 

landscape will continue to present both challenges and opportunities for community 

bankers who are deeply committed to the provision of credit to small businesses.  I 

remain confident that community bankers will continue to play a vital role in the small 

                                                 
23 For example, see www.responsiblebusinesslending.org.

business lending landscape as the respective business models of online platforms and 

community banks evolve.  The advantage that comes from close relationships with their 

customers and intimate knowledge of their communities that lie at the heart of 

community banking will continue to provide a powerful advantage in serving the vital 

banking needs of small businesses, even as the use of nontraditional sources of data and 

electronic processing platforms may permit faster loan decisions, especially for smaller 

loan amounts, to a broader set of borrowers. 

Thank you, again, to the conference organizers for inviting me to this important 

event and for the opportunity to speak to you today.
