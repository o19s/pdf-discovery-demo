Thank you very much for your invitation to speak at this second annual symposium on 

financial regulatory reform.  Before addressing that topic, I want to say a word about the 

mortgage foreclosure documentation imbroglio, the latest chapter in the recent sad history of 

mortgage finance in this country.   

The Need to Increase Mortgage Modifications 

As you know, inquiries into the extent of, and culpability for, these problems are 

currently being conducted by banking regulators, other federal agencies, and state attorneys 

general.  Regardless of the findings that emerge, and the steps that servicers and others may take 

to correct their mistakes, this episode has again drawn attention to what can only be described as 

a perverse set of incentives for homeowners with underwater mortgages.  Homeowners who try 

to get a modification of the terms of their mortgages are all too frequently subject to delay and 

disappointment.  On the other hand, those who simply stop paying their mortgages have found 

that they can often stay in their homes for a year or more, rent free, before the foreclosure 

process moves ahead.     

This simply is not a good outcome from any broad perspective--not for the revival of 

housing markets, not for the banks and investors that hold the delinquent mortgages, and in the 

longer run, not even for the homeowners themselves, who will ultimately have to move out, 

taking with them a dark cloud over their creditworthiness.   

Several possible explanations have been suggested for this untoward state of affairs--the 

lack of servicer capacity to execute modifications, purported financial incentives for servicers to 

foreclose rather than modify, what until recently appeared to be easier execution of foreclosures 

relative to modifications, limits on the authority of securitization trustees, and conflicts between 

primary and secondary lien holders.  Whatever the merits and relative weights of these various 


2 
 

 
 

explanations, the social costs of this situation are huge.  It just cannot be the case that foreclosure 

is preferable to modification--including reductions of principal--for a significant proportion of 

mortgages where the deadweight costs of foreclosure, including a distressed sale discount, are so 

high.  While some banks and other industry participants have stepped forward to increase the rate 

of modifications relative to foreclosures, many have not done enough.  I would hope that both 

servicers and ultimate holders of the mortgages will take this occasion not just to correct 

documentation flaws and to contest who should bear the losses of mortgages gone bad, but to 

invigorate the modification process. 

Next Steps Down the Reform Road 

I note that while last year's conference was called "Regulatory Reform at the Crossroads," 

this year's event is entitled "The Dodd-Frank Act and the Road Ahead for Financial Regulatory 

Reform."  The metaphor of a long road ahead following key decisions in Dodd-Frank is an apt 

one for the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies that will, over the next 15 to 20 

months, complete implementation of that bill through scores of regulations.  The metaphor also 

applies to elaboration and domestic implementation of the framework for Basel III that was 

agreed to internationally in September.   

Though we may no longer face a major crossroads, the federal banking agencies will 

certainly encounter numerous forks in the road we are travelling.  Choices will be presented 

during implementation of certain Dodd-Frank provisions that set a general direction for change, 

but do not mandate a precise route.  Others will be encountered as we continue the Basel III 

exercise, to which I will return in a moment.  Still other choices will doubtless be required as all 

the member agencies of the new Financial Stability Oversight Council evaluate and, potentially, 


3 
 

 
 

respond to developments in financial markets.  Finally, at least one big crossroad still lies    

ahead--a decision on the future of the government-sponsored housing finance agencies.   

We are, of course, in the middle of the Dodd-Frank implementation process.  Thus, while 

I recognize there is enormous interest in where the Federal Reserve and other rule-writing 

agencies may be headed, I cannot say much about the substance of the regulations that will 

eventually be proposed and adopted.  Indeed, I think it would be inconsistent with the very 

purpose of administrative law requirements for me to come to my own conclusions, much less 

opine publicly on them, before we have made our proposals and evaluated all the comments.    

What I can say is that, in implementing Dodd-Frank, the Board of Governors will be 

guided by the same norms of statutory construction that a court would apply.  Most importantly, 

where Congressional intentions are clear from the language of the statute, we must faithfully 

execute those intentions.  Of course, there are a good many provisions that do not admit of a 

single interpretation, and the implementation of those provisions will require the exercise of 

discretion by the Federal Reserve or other regulatory agencies.   

I can also say that we are following a transparent and inclusive process that goes well 

beyond the classic notice and comment requirements for agencies adopting regulations.  As to 

transparency: At the Federal Reserve, we are entering into the public record a summary of all 

communications with non-government groups or individuals regarding matters subject to a 

potential or proposed rulemaking under Dodd-Frank.  As to inclusiveness: We have joined with 

the other banking agencies in sponsoring a series of joint forums to solicit views from industry, 

academics, and others on some key issues relevant to Dodd-Frank implementation.  We are also 

hearing views on regulatory implementation at meetings that cover a broad range of topics, such 

as at our last Consumer Advisory Council session.

Reforming Minimum Capital Requirements 

Although they had long used bank capital ratios as a supervisory tool, U.S. bank 

regulators did not impose explicit minimum capital requirements until the 1980s.  The proximate 

reason for this change was regulatory concern over the decline in capital ratios of the largest 

banks--a concern reinforced by Congress, as it saw some of those large banks facing enormous 

losses on their loans to foreign sovereigns.  This U.S. regulatory innovation was effectively 

internationalized a few years later in the original Basel Accord.   

At the same time, regulators came to regard capital requirements as a supple prudential 

tool.  As activity and affiliation restrictions were loosened in the United States, capital 

requirements seemed a promising way to protect the public’s interest in the stability of financial 

institutions that had access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window and Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation insurance.  Capital requirements promised to provide a buffer against 

bank losses from any activities in which the bank or its affiliates might engage, a consideration 

of equal or greater relevance in countries with universal banking models.  Some support also 

developed for the proposition that minimum capital levels could, by maintaining a material 

equity value for the bank, serve as a disincentive for excessive risk-taking by management and 

shareholders.   

In the ensuing quarter century, the attention of banking regulators around the world had 

been heavily oriented toward elaborating capital requirements to reflect more precisely the 

particular risks faced by a financial institution.  Capital requirements had, to a considerable 

extent, become the dominant prudential regulatory tool. 

The financial crisis showed that the concentrated, almost all-consuming regulatory focus 

on refining bank capital requirements in Basel II had come at the expense of attention to other 


5 
 

 
 

risks in the financial system.  In particular, there was insufficient appreciation of the implications 

of the growth in size, leverage, and maturity transformation levels of the shadow banking system 

for the balance sheets of commercial banks and for overall financial stability.  The limitations of 

capital requirements as a regulatory tool, such as the frequent lag between declines in asset 

values and reductions in bank capital, were also confirmed by experience during the crisis. 

But it was also evident that capital requirements had simply been set too low in general, 

and with respect to particular assets.  One of the most obvious examples was the capital 

requirement for asset-backed securities in the trading books of banks.  The requirement was 

based on returns over a 10-day holding period, used a one-year observation period that had been 

characterized by unusually low price volatility, and neglected the credit risks inherent in these 

traded instruments.  It was also apparent that at least some of the instruments that qualified as 

“Tier 1 capital” for regulatory purposes were not reliable buffers against losses, at least not on a 

going concern basis.   

It is instructive that during the height of the crisis, counterparties and other market actors 

looked almost exclusively to the amount of tangible common equity held by financial institutions 

in evaluating the creditworthiness and overall stability of those institutions--they essentially 

ignored the Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios in regulatory requirements.  In the fall of 

2008, there was widespread doubt in markets that the common equity of some of our largest 

institutions was sufficient to withstand the losses that those firms appeared to be facing.  This 

doubt made investors and counterparties increasingly reluctant to deal with these firms, 

contributing to the severe liquidity strains that characterized financial markets at the time. 

It is obvious that the post-crisis regulatory system will not be as dependent on capital 

requirements as the pre-crisis regime.  Dodd-Frank itself is testimony to this fact, as are a 


6 
 

 
 

number of changes already made by banking agencies.  There will be increased emphasis on 

market discipline, liquidity regulation, activities restrictions, and more effective supervision.  But 

the crisis reinforces the point that robust capital requirements should continue to be a central 

component of the financial regulatory system.  The U.S. banking agencies, and most of our 

counterparts from countries represented in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, made 

strengthening the capital regime a high priority in the latest financial reform agenda. 

Basel III makes a number of important changes to address deficiencies in the pre-crisis 

capital rules:   

First, reflecting both intuitive good sense and market realities during the crisis, Basel III 

creates a new minimum common equity capital requirement.  Moreover, the agreement provides 

a definition of common equity that will prevent firms or national regulators from including in the 

calculation of common equity certain assets that could dilute its loss-absorbing character. 

Second, the minimum common equity ratio will be set at 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, 

with an additional requirement for a 2.5% “conservation buffer.”   The minimum ratio should be 

understood as defining the amount of common equity needed for a firm to be regarded as a 

viable financial intermediary.  The conservation buffer is a new feature of capital regulation, 

intended specifically to reflect the losses that a firm may suffer during periods of financial stress. 

Thus the concept behind the two-level requirement is that a banking organization should 

be able to withstand losses associated with systemic stress and still be a viable financial 

intermediary.  This concept is comparable to the approach we adopted during the Supervisory 

Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in early 2009.  There, you may recall, we used a special 

stress test to provide a rough estimate of losses that the large banking organizations could face in 


7 
 

 
 

an adverse scenario and asked that they hold capital sufficient to absorb those losses and still be 

above common equity levels that would maintain the firms as viable intermediaries. 

There is no direct way to calculate how much equity is needed to assure markets that a 

banking organization is viable.  In our internal analysis at the Federal Reserve in preparation for 

the Basel Committee deliberations, we analyzed distributions of actual losses suffered by larger 

institutions over the last several decades, on the assumption that an institution that could 

withstand such losses at a high confidence level would be regarded as a viable going concern.  

For the conservation buffer, we looked at actual pre-SCAP losses incurred by large banking 

firms during the recent stress period and SCAP estimates of additional losses associated with the 

recent stress period.  Both these determinations required considerable judgment, and thus we 

developed ranges, rather than point estimates, for the levels we thought reasonable.  In particular, 

government capital injections and debt guarantees in the fall of 2008 complicated the estimation 

of losses that might have been incurred in the absence of too-big-to-fail support.  The ratios 

agreed to in Basel were at the lower end of, though still within, the ranges we had calculated.   

The practical effect of the two-level approach is that banks under stress may let their 

common equity ratio drop below the 7% level that is the sum of the minimum and buffer 

requirements.  However, restrictions on capital distributions will result, which will become 

progressively more stringent as the common equity ratio drops closer to the 4.5% minimum.   

The buffer is thus designed to forestall banks from continuing to pay dividends even as they 

come under stress, a practice observed in some institutions during the financial crisis.  

Realistically, both regulators and markets will expect firms generally to maintain their common 

equity ratios above 7%.

Third, Basel III makes extensive changes to the risk weights assigned to a financial 

institution’s traded assets and counterparty exposures.  As I mentioned earlier, the market-risk 

requirements of the pre-crisis capital regime were woefully inadequate.  In many instances, they 

simply did not reflect the actual risk assumed by an institution.  They also created an invitation to 

arbitrage credit risks by turning them into traded assets with lower risk weights.  It is also 

noteworthy that the changes in risk weights incorporate some elements of a macroprudential 

perspective as, for example, in higher capital requirements on equity investments in other 

financial firms and credit exposures to large financial firms   

Fourth, Basel III provides for a minimum leverage ratio, roughly similar to requirements 

already applicable under national law in the United States and Canada.  While the terms of this 

leverage requirement have been agreed to, there will be a supervisory monitoring period and then 

a parallel run to assess its impact, particularly in countries with no history of such a requirement, 

and to provide for adjustments if warranted. 

Finally, Basel III has a rather lengthy and complicated transition period, with the new 

requirements to be phased in between January 1, 2013, and January 1, 2019.  We favored a 

significant transition period, so as to allow firms flexibility in adjusting to the new regime 

through such means as running off higher risk-weighted assets, adjusting their business models 

gradually, or using retained earnings to add any new capital that might be required under the new 

rules.  To be honest, however, we did not think the transition period needed to stretch over eight 

years.  In fact, it appears that most U.S. banking entities expect to meet the new requirements 

considerably sooner.  However, the lengthy transition period was an important inducement for 

some countries to agree to the new, much stronger standards.

With the agreements reached in July and September at meetings of the Governors and 

Heads of Supervision (GHOS) in Basel, the structure and basic elements of Basel III are clear.  

Details are still being worked out by the Basel Committee.  Then, of course, the U.S. banking 

agencies will need to implement Basel III through domestic capital regulations.   

Basel III is not a perfect agreement, of course.  There are things we would have done 

differently if we were writing a capital regulation on our own.  There will surely be some 

technical challenges in implementing it.  It does not really address some pre-crisis problems in 

capital regulation such as pro-cyclicality.  But it is a major step forward for capital regulation.  It 

will raise minimum requirements substantially, ensure that regulatory capital is truly loss 

absorbing, and discourage some of the risky activities for which the pre-crisis regime required 

far too little capital.   

Basel III was also a major step forward in international cooperation.  In all candor, as 

recently as this past spring I was concerned that we might be unable to agree in Basel on such 

key issues as a distinct common equity requirement.  However, under the strong leadership of 

Nout Wellink in the Basel Committee and Jean-Claude Trichet in the GHOS, we concluded a 

good agreement in timely fashion.  I believe that another factor in turning things around was that, 

unlike at some times in the past, the U.S. banking agencies spoke with a single, unified voice in 

Basel. 

 Obviously, the benefits of Basel III for financial stability will be realized only if they are 

implemented rigorously.  In this regard, it is important to draw a distinction between, on the one 

hand, implementation in the sense of enacting national regulations that incorporate the Basel 

standards and, on the other, implementation in the sense that firms are actually holding the 

amounts of capital called for by the internationally agreed rules. 


10 
 

 
 

The Basel Committee must be able to monitor effectively implementation of, and 

compliance with, these new capital standards.  A number of market analysts have noted that, 

even under current market risk capital rules, there is considerable apparent variation in the risk-

weightings apparently applied by different banks.  We are urging the Committee to explore 

mechanisms for ensuring that these strengthened capital standards lead to a consistency in 

application, as well as in the provisions of relevant domestic regulations. 

Along these lines, we have heard complaints from a few other countries that Basel II is 

not yet operative for our large, internationally active banking organizations in the United States.  

As we have explained, despite the substantial resources devoted by both banking organizations 

and supervisors to the tasks of developing and validating the Advanced Internal Ratings-Based 

Approach in those institutions, we continue to encounter significant difficulties.  The suggestion 

that U.S. banking organizations have thereby gained a competitive advantage is misplaced, 

however.  For one thing, we required significant capital increases as part of the SCAP and the 

Troubled Asset Relief Program repayment processes last year.  Also, we note that the required 

capital levels for some foreign banks adopting Basel II apparently declined from Basel I levels.  

In-depth oversight by the Basel Committee of implementation and compliance would 

allow supervisors from all member countries better to understand issues such as these.  I suspect 

it would also result in supervisors learning from one another and thus improving the quality of 

large institution capital regulation globally.  Although, fortunately, Basel III does not present 

nearly the degree of technical challenge posed by the advanced approach of Basel II, there will 

still be a good bit of opaqueness in how some of its components are implemented and thus a 

continuing need for significant monitoring by the Basel Committee. 


11 
 

 
 

One piece of unfinished business on the international capital regulatory agenda arises 

from the agreement by the GHOS in September that systemically important financial institutions 

should have loss absorbing capacity beyond the Basel III requirements.  This international 

position parallels the Dodd-Frank requirement that the Federal Reserve apply capital 

requirements to large, interconnected financial institutions that are more stringent than those 

applied to other banks.  We think it serves U.S. interests to develop our plans for implementing 

our domestic statutory obligation in tandem with our participation in this international process, 

so as to maximize the chances of convergence of international standards and our own practice.  

Work on this issue in the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board will continue well 

into next year.   

Dividend Policy 

Before closing, I want to address requests for renewed or increased dividends by our 

large bank holding companies, an issue in which there has been substantial recent interest.  

During the crisis, dividends were eventually suspended or reduced to minimal levels by all the 

banking organizations covered by the SCAP.  As the financial system has stabilized, some firms 

have indicated an interest in resuming or increasing dividends, or repurchasing shares.  We have 

been concerned with the safety and soundness implications of resuming or increasing capital 

distributions in the absence of a strong, forward-looking demonstration that the capital position 

of a firm would be protected even under stressed conditions.  Until Basel III was completed and 

Dodd-Frank enacted, it was obviously difficult for any firm to make that kind of demonstration, 

since its future capital needs and potential business model changes were obviously unknown.   

While there continues to be a relatively high degree of uncertainty about near- to 

medium-term economic prospects, the basic questions surrounding capital and regulatory reform 


12 
 

 
 

have now been answered.  We anticipate that some firms with high capital levels that have been 

retaining solid earnings for several quarters will be interested in increasing or resuming 

dividends.  In response to these anticipated requests, we will soon be issuing supervisory 

guidelines applicable to such requests from the largest holding companies for the first quarter of 

next year.   

Although the details of these guidelines are still being finalized, I can say that our 

approach to considering such requests will be a conservative one.  We will expect firms to 

submit convincing capital plans that demonstrate their ability to absorb losses over the next two 

years under an adverse economic scenario that we will specify, and still remain amply 

capitalized.  We also expect that firms will have a sound estimate of any significant risks that 

may not be captured by the stress testing, such as potential mortgage putback exposures, and the 

capacity to absorb any consequent losses.  The firms will also be asked to show how, even with 

their proposed capital distributions, they will readily and comfortably meet the Basel III 

requirements as they come into effect, as well as to accommodate any business model changes 

that might be necessitated by Dodd-Frank. 

Conclusion 

The final set of major Dodd-Frank regulations will not be completed until early 2012.  A 

year from now we will be in the midst of a regulatory process implementing Basel III, and there 

will likely be an active debate over the future of the government-sponsored enterprises.  So I see 

little risk that the third annual conference on financial regulatory reform at George Washington 

Law School will be entitled “The End of the Road.”  Maybe, just maybe, I have given you a title 

for the fourth.  Then again, maybe not.
