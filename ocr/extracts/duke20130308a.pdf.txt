Since joining the Board in 2008 amid a crisis centered on mortgage lending, I 

have focused much of my attention on housing and mortgage markets, issues surrounding 

foreclosures, and neighborhood stabilization.  Today I am pleased to provide some 

comments about the outlook for housing and mortgages.  Before I proceed, I should note 

that the views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the 

Board of Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

I think the evidence is pretty clear that a recovery in the housing market is finally 

under way.  National house prices have increased for 13 consecutive months and are now 

10 percent higher than at their trough in December 2011.1  Construction activity has also 

picked up.  Housing starts and permits are still far below their peaks but have risen by 

about one-third over the past year, and homebuilder sentiment has improved notably.2  

New and existing home sales have increased.  In national surveys, households report that 

low interest rates and house prices make it a good time to buy a home; they also appear 

more certain that house price gains will continue.3  And real estate agents report stronger 

traffic of people shopping for homes.4 

The open question is whether this positive trend is sustainable.  When I look at the 

factors driving recent improvement and those that have inhibited housing recovery 

through the downturn, I conclude that recent gains in the housing market will continue 

and perhaps even strengthen.  My main hesitation with this forecast is that mortgage 

credit conditions remain quite tight for many would-be borrowers, and I suspect that the

easing of these conditions will be a slow and gradual process.  In particular, I expect 

demand to come from a pickup in new household formation, but I also recognize that 

these households may be the very population that faces especially tight credit conditions.  

I will return to the subject of mortgage credit later in my talk. 

Housing Market Overview and Outlook 

Last year’s house price gains were achieved in an environment largely defined by 

historically unusual factors:  a large number of underwater homeowners, which have 

effectively reduced the supply of properties for sale; the fact that foreclosed properties 

continue to represent an outsized, although gradually decreasing, share of sales 

transactions; and strong demand on the part of investors.   

Turning first to underwater homeowners, although the actual number of these 

homeowners is unknown--plausible estimates range fairly broadly from 7 million to 

14 million--it seems clear that some are unable or unwilling to sell their homes because 

they lack the funds to carry out the transactions or are reluctant to realize losses.  As a 

result, some potential sellers have not responded to the signs of housing market recovery 

by putting their properties on the market.  The number of single-family homes for sale 

has fallen to its lowest level in a decade, which has likely contributed to the recent house 

price gains.  Indeed, cities that started 2012 with an outsized share of underwater 

homeowners have seen some of the largest price increases. 

Next, sales of properties from lenders’ real estate owned (REO) inventories 

represented 14 percent of sales transactions in 2012, down from 21 percent in 2010.5  

These sales have damped house prices by increasing the supply of homes for sale and, in

some areas, by reducing the desirability of a neighborhood as a place to live.6  This effect 

may be diminishing, as the foreclosure inventory has gradually started to decline.  The 

decline in REO sales has been partly offset by an increase in short sales, but these 

properties tend to transact at smaller discounts than REO properties.7 

Finally, investors have been attracted to the housing market because of the low 

prices on REO properties.  The properties tend to sell at lower prices because some are 

damaged and because lenders may be more motivated sellers than the typical 

homeowner.  The combination of a low purchase price, a possible steady stream of rental 

income, and the potential for significant capital gains has attracted considerable interest 

from large institutional investors as well as from the mom-and-pop investors who have 

historically dominated this market.  This increase in investor demand has supported 

house prices so far and may continue to provide a floor for them.  

What role will these forces play going forward?  I think house prices will continue 

to rise, as the supply of existing homes on the market will remain quite tight.  I do not 

believe that a flood of houses on the market from households that are currently 

underwater or from bank REO is likely to materialize or to be sufficient to outpace 

growing demand. 

As house price gains continue, more underwater homeowners will regain a 

position of positive equity in their homes.  House price increases of 10 percent or less 

would be sufficient for about 40 percent of underwater homeowners to regain positive 

equity; presumably, some subset of those homeowners will be interested in selling their

homes.  If the majority of newly above-water sellers exit homeownership, they could 

create a substantial increase in overall supply and change the trajectory of house prices.  

But I think it is much more likely that many of them will also purchase a home in the 

same market, perhaps moving up to a larger home or downsizing to a smaller one.  In that 

case, they would create additional demand as well as supply.  And, in any event, the sales 

would provide more clarity about the level of house prices and increase liquidity in these 

markets.   

The weight of the shadow inventory--homes in the process of foreclosure or loans 

90 days or more past due--on home prices is likely to wane as the number of loans 

entering the foreclosure pipeline declines and those already in the pipeline resolve.  I 

think the nature and duration of the effect on prices will vary across the country, 

depending on the location of the shadow inventory and the speed of its resolution.  Some 

evidence of this relationship can be found by comparing the relative performance of 

house prices in states where foreclosures are processed through the court system (judicial 

states) with performance in states where foreclosures do not go through the courts 

(nonjudicial states). 

Through mid-2012, house prices fell further in nonjudicial states than in judicial 

states, likely in part because the faster nonjudicial foreclosure process boosted the for-

sale inventory in those states.  Since that time, though, prices have moved back up in 

nonjudicial states, as the inventory was worked down while prices drifted lower in 

judicial states as inventory accumulated.  Over time, the shadow inventory is becoming 

more concentrated in states with the slower judicial foreclosure processes and will likely 


 - 5 - 

continue to damp house prices in those states.  Nonetheless, the specific dynamics going 

forward will depend on the pace at which these properties are put on the market for sale.  

Investor activity is difficult to predict.  As house prices rise, some investors may 

no longer find purchasing homes to be a profitable enterprise.  Other investors may want 

to lock in their gains and sell properties.  The prospect of steady rental income and 

possible further capital gains, though, will likely continue to be attractive to many 

investors.  In addition, I suspect that the development of large-scale rental of single-

family homes as an asset class has gained enough traction with investors to continue in 

some form. 

For the housing recovery to gain true momentum, however, demand for housing 

among owner-occupiers must increase.  As I noted earlier, household sentiment toward 

homebuying, as measured by households’ assessments of purchasing conditions and by 

homebuyer traffic, appears to be on an upswing and should gradually strengthen demand.  

But I expect the strongest impetus to recovery to come from pent-up demand for housing 

in the form of household formation.  Between 2006 and 2011, roughly 550,000 new 

households formed per year, on net, significantly fewer than the 1.35 million per year 

over the previous five years.  Indeed, household formation from 2006 to 2011 appears to 

have been far lower than in any other five-year period since at least the mid-1960s.8 

Federal Reserve staff research indicates that this decline in household formation 

largely reflects the weak labor market, especially among younger adults.  If you have an 

adult son or daughter still living at home because he or she can’t find a job, it might not 

surprise you to know that the number of individuals aged 18 to 30 living with older 

                                                 
8 The finding is from staff calculations based on data from the Housing Vacancy Survey supplement of the 
Current Population Survey.  See U.S. Department of Commerce (2013), “Housing Vacancy Survey,” U.S. 
Census Bureau, www.census.gov/history/www/programs/housing/housing_vacancy_survey.html.

family members increased between 2006 and 2010 by over 1 million more than would be 

expected by the demographic trend.9  In this downturn, the unemployment rate among 

younger adults rose by more than among the population as a whole.  And when they are 

unemployed or have low incomes, younger individuals are particularly likely to live with 

their parents or older family members rather than moving out on their own.   

As the unemployment rate continues to decline--albeit likely at a slower pace than 

any of us would like--household formation and housing demand should increase.  One 

model suggests that household formation could increase to 1-1/2 million or more per 

year.  If, as seems likely, however, many of these new households rent rather than buy 

their homes, the effect on rental housing could be stronger than for owner-occupied 

homes, and applications for mortgages to purchase homes might recover only slowly. 

Evidence to date of an increase in home purchases by owner-occupiers--as 

opposed to investors--is scarce.  The most discouraging evidence comes from purchase 

mortgage originations.  Data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 

(HMDA) indicate that in 2011, purchase mortgage originations hit their lowest level 

since the early 1990s.  According to Federal Reserve staff estimates, purchase 

originations remained near these subdued levels in 2012 even as mortgage rates hit 

historic lows. 

The drop in purchase mortgage originations, although widespread, has been most 

pronounced among borrowers with low credit scores.  For example, between 2007 and 

2012, purchase originations fell by about 30 percent for borrowers with credit scores 

above 780, compared with a fall of about 90 percent for borrowers with credit scores

between 620 and 680.  Originations are virtually nonexistent for borrowers with credit 

scores below 620. 

Whether this pattern stems from tight supply or from weak demand among 

borrowers with lower credit scores, it has disturbing implications for potential new 

households.  Younger individuals--who have seen the greatest drop in household 

formation--have, on average, credit scores that are more than 50 points lower than those 

of older individuals, a difference that existed even before the recession.   

Staff analysis comparing first-time homebuying in recent years with historical 

levels underscores the contraction in credit supply.  From late 2009 to late 2011, the 

fraction of individuals under 40 years of age getting a mortgage for the first time was 

about half of what it was in the early 2000s.10  The drop was especially pronounced for 

individuals with low credit scores and remained large even after controlling for local 

unemployment rates and for measures of the individual’s demand for credit--a result 

indicating that tight credit supply is an important factor. 

As I noted earlier, household formation has been particularly weak among young 

individuals, who are also a large part of the potential first-time homebuyer population.  

Many of these young individuals have relatively weak credit records and are more likely 

to have had a recent spell of unemployment.  Our staff analysis highlights how tight 

credit conditions are for such individuals in the current environment.  In the early 2000s, 

about one-third of first-time homebuyers under the age of 40 had credit scores below 620, 

and another one-fourth had scores between 620 and 680.  Today, many of these 

individuals would have a difficult time obtaining mortgage credit.

Why Is Mortgage Credit So Tight? 

Why are conditions still so tight for these potential first-time homebuyers, and 

when might they return to normal?  As I’ll discuss next, the mortgage market is reacting 

to a variety of economic, market, and regulatory issues that may not be present in other 

lending markets.  So it’s difficult to predict what a “normal” mortgage market will look 

like when things settle down.  After the crisis we have just experienced, I am pretty sure 

that we don’t want the market to return to the lending environment of the pre-crisis boom 

times.  But I also don’t think it would be a good idea to go back to the quite restrictive 

credit conditions of the early 1980s.   

Part of the tightening in mortgage credit standards is the result of lender fears 

about the economy and the trajectory of house prices.  Of respondents who reported 

tightening mortgage lending standards in the April 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion 

Survey on Bank Lending Practices, more than 80 percent identified concerns about the 

economy or house prices as a factor in their decision.  As the economic recovery 

continues, lenders should gain confidence that mortgage loans will perform well, and 

they should expand their lending accordingly. 

Credit for potential home purchasers with lower credit scores--in particular, the 

first-time homebuyers I discussed earlier--has likely also been affected by capacity 

constraints of mortgage lenders.  As most of you know very well, the mortgage industry 

has been operating near its capacity.  Although purchase originations have been subdued, 

refinancing originations, according to staff estimates, have responded to record-low 

interest rates by more than doubling from mid-2011 to the end of 2012.   


 - 9 - 

The ratio of refinance applications to the number of real estate credit employees--

a measure of capacity constraints--has been at levels near those seen during the record 

2003 refinancing boom.  And, at the same time, each loan takes longer to process, as all 

elements of an application are now fully documented.  Capacity may be slow to expand, 

as hiring and training additional staff takes time and some lenders may judge the boom as 

likely to be too short lived to justify the cost.  Indeed, the number of real estate credit 

employees, as measured by the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, has only edged up over 

the past year. 

When capacity constraints are binding, lenders may manage the surge in 

refinancing demand by holding mortgage rates high relative to lenders’ funding costs.  

That would explain the pattern observed during refinance booms, such as the one in 2003, 

when mortgage rates fell more slowly than yields on mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  

Also, when MBS yields drop sharply, as occurred in September 2012 when the Federal 

Reserve announced its most recent MBS purchase program, the mortgage rate may take 

time to adjust as a result of both capacity issues and the need to process loans with rate 

locks in place.  

Furthermore, when refinancing demand is high, lenders have less incentive to 

pursue harder-to-complete or less profitable loan applications.  In the current 

environment, refinance applications by high-credit-quality borrowers--many of whom 

may have refinanced repeatedly as rates have fallen over the past couple of years--are 

likely the easiest to complete.  And refinances under the revised Home Affordable 

Refinance Program, require substantially less documentation than other loans.  It is 

possible that the abundance of these applications may have had the unintended effect of 


 - 10 - 

crowding out borrowers with lower credit scores, whose applications may be more time 

consuming to process.  Indeed, staff research suggests that the increase in the refinance 

workload during the past 18 months appears to be associated with a 50 percent decrease 

in purchase originations among borrowers with credit scores between 620 and 680 and a 

15 percent decrease among borrowers with credit scores between 680 and 720.  Purchase 

originations among borrowers with higher credit scores appear to be affected to only a 

small degree. 

Any crowding-out effect that does exist due to capacity constraints should start to 

unwind if mortgage rates stay at the current levels or rise, in which case the current 

refinancing boom will begin to run out of steam.  Lenders might then ease credit 

conditions to fill declining refinance pipelines with additional purchase volume.  At the 

same time, as lenders gain more confidence in the strength of the economic recovery and 

the upswing in house prices, their outlook for home-purchase originations may brighten, 

making them more confident in easing standards or increasing capacity.  Even so, there 

are still a number of nonmarket forces at work that could make lenders more cautious 

than normal.   

For example, lenders remain concerned about the risk that they will be required to 

repurchase defaulted loans from the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs)--the so-

called putback risk.  The ability to hold lenders accountable for poorly underwritten loans 

is a significant protection for taxpayers.  However, if lenders are unsure about the 

conditions under which they will be required to repurchase loans sold to the GSEs, they 

may shy away from originating loans to borrowers whose risk profiles indicate a higher 

likelihood of default.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency launched an important 


 - 11 - 

initiative last year to clarify the liabilities associated with representations and warranties, 

but so far, those efforts do not appear to have been sufficient to keep putback risk from 

weighing on the mortgage market. 

Mortgage servicing standards, particularly for delinquent loans, are more stringent 

than in the past due to settlement actions and consent orders.  Servicing rules recently 

released by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will extend many of these 

standards to all lenders.  These standards remedy past abuses and provide important 

protections to borrowers, but they also increase the cost of servicing nonperforming 

loans.  Under current servicing compensation arrangements, servicers receive the same 

monthly servicing fee for the routine processing of current loans as they do for the more 

expensive processing of defaulted loans, a model that assumes that the higher profits on 

routine processing will offset the cost of servicing delinquent loans.  However, this 

compensation model, coupled with higher default servicing costs, may instead make 

lenders less willing to extend credit to lower-credit-quality borrowers, who are more 

likely to default.  A change to servicer compensation models, especially for default 

servicing, could alleviate some of the concern about making these loans, albeit at higher 

costs to some borrowers. 

Another key factor contributing to mortgage lender caution is uncertainty about 

the ultimate regulatory environment.  Regulatory decisions will work individually and 

collectively to shape the cost and availability of mortgage credit in the future.  So it is 

important for policymakers to think carefully about their individual decisions as well as 

how those decisions will work within the full constellation of mortgage regulation.  

Regulatory changes are being implemented to ensure that borrowers have more 


 - 12 - 

protections and lenders take into account the costs that imprudent mortgage lending can 

impose on communities, the financial system, and the economy.  The accompanying 

effect, however, may be tighter credit standards, especially for lower-credit-quality 

borrowers, than prevailed during most of the past decade.  It will be up to policymakers 

to find the right balance between consumer safety and financial stability, on the one hand, 

and availability and cost of credit, on the other. 

The CFPB took an important step toward resolving regulatory uncertainty when it 

released a host of rules in January, including rules on ability-to-repay requirements, the 

definition of a qualified mortgage (QM), loan officer compensation, and servicing 

standards.  

The Federal Reserve and other agencies are in the process of moving forward on 

proposed rulemakings that would implement revised regulatory capital requirements and 

the requirements for risk retention mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which include an exemption for mortgages that meet 

the definition of qualified residential mortgages (QRMs).  These and other prudential 

rules, taken together with the CFPB rules, will further shape the economics of mortgage 

lending.  For example, bank capital rules will specify the amount of capital a bank must 

hold against certain mortgages.  The risk retention rule will specify which loans in the 

QM universe qualify as QRM loans and therefore are not subject to risk retention when 

securitized.  The risk retention rules will also define how securitizers must meet the risk 

retention requirement for mortgages that are not QRMs, and the cost associated with this 

requirement may affect mortgage costs.  I won’t comment today on the rulemakings that 

are still under way.  However, I believe that, as we layer on additional requirements, it is 


 - 13 - 

important to think about the implications of the rules that have already been finalized.  So 

I would like to share my assessment of some potential implications of the QM rule. 

To provide a little context, the QM rule is part of a larger ability-to-repay 

rulemaking that requires lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination that 

the borrower can repay the loan.  Many of the rules’ requirements for verification of 

income, assets, and other payment obligations are probably standard practice for lenders 

today.  But having the rules in place, reinforced with increased legal risk for lenders that 

do not meet the rules’ requirements, helps ensure that these practices continue, even as 

the economy improves and competition heats up.  Borrowers who cannot afford their 

loans can sue the lender for violations of the ability-to-repay rules and claim monetary 

damages.  If the original lender sells or securitizes the loan, the borrower can claim these 

damages at any time in a foreclosure action taken by the lender or any assignee.  If the 

mortgage meets the QM standard, however, the lender receives some degree of protection 

from such potential lawsuits because it is presumed that the borrower had the ability to 

repay the loan. 

Loans outside the QM box may become more costly for lenders and borrowers for 

at least three reasons.  The first reason is the possible increase in foreclosure losses and 

litigation costs.  Although the expected losses from this litigation are likely to be small, 

the full extent of the costs and of lenders’ legal liability will become known only after the 

initial round of ability-to-repay suits are settled by the courts.  The second reason is that 

mortgages that do not meet the QM definition also, by definition, will not meet the future 

QRM standard, and so lenders will be required to retain some of the risk if these loans are 

securitized.  This requirement may increase costs and limit the size of the market.  The 


 - 14 - 

third reason is that investors may be wary of investing in securities collateralized by non-

QM loans because it is difficult to gauge the risks.  A borrower’s ability to repay a loan 

that is not a QM may be based on “soft” information or on idiosyncratic factors that are 

difficult for the investor to observe or monitor.  Investors may respond to this information 

asymmetry by requiring a higher risk premium or by refusing to purchase these securities 

altogether.  For all of these reasons, the non-QM market could become small and illiquid, 

which would further increase the cost of these loans. 

Loans eligible to be purchased, insured, or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie 

Mac, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), the U.S. Department of Veterans 

Affairs, or the U.S. Department of Agriculture are automatically designated as QMs.  

This provision is slated to end no later than January 2021.  As long as such loans remain 

an outsized share of mortgage originations, the QM rule may have less of an effect on the 

availability of mortgage credit. 

As more private capital returns to the mortgage market, though, two aspects of the 

QM rule will have a more significant effect on access to credit:  the debt-to-income (DTI) 

requirement and the provisions that affect interest rates, points, and fees.  Turning first to 

DTI, under the QM definition, borrower payments on all debts and some recurring 

obligations--such as mortgages, credit card debt, student loans, auto loans, alimony, and 

child support--must be 43 percent or less of borrower income.  To gauge the possible 

number of borrowers affected by this requirement, the Board staff looked at households 

in the Survey of Consumer Finances that purchased a home with mortgage credit in the 

two years preceding the survey.  In the 2001, 2004, and 2010 waves of the survey, about 

15 to 20 percent of these households had payments that exceeded 43 percent of income, 


 - 15 - 

although the share spiked to 40 percent in the 2007 survey.11  The households with high 

DTIs tended to have lower income, fewer financial assets, and higher mortgage loan-to-

value ratios than households with lower payment ratios.  Of course, some of these 

households may be able to reduce their DTIs by purchasing a less expensive house or by 

delaying home purchase for the time it takes to pay off some existing debt.  Nonetheless, 

the borrowers most affected by this aspect of the rule are likely also those who currently 

face tight access to credit, such as first-time or less-creditworthy borrowers. 

  The QM definition may also affect lenders’ ability to charge for the risks of 

originating loans to borrowers who are more likely to default.  For example, lenders 

might compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the loan.  However, if 

lenders originate a QM with an annual percentage rate (APR) that is 150 basis points or 

more above the rate available to the highest-quality borrowers (known as a higher-priced 

loan), lenders receive less protection against lawsuits claiming violation of the ability-to-

repay and QM rules.  The extent to which this lower level of legal protection (the 

“rebuttable presumption of compliance”) will affect lenders’ willingness to originate such 

loans is still unclear. 

Very few of these higher-priced loans are being originated currently, reflecting 

the weak mortgage demand and tight underwriting standards that I discussed earlier.  The 

HMDA data suggest that only 4 percent of mortgages originated in 2011 carried APRs 

this high.  However, as demand picks up and lending standards ease, the number of 

                                                 
11 Homeowner DTI is measured at the time of the survey, not at the time of loan origination, and may 
understate the number of affected households if household finances improve after the purchase of a home.  
A recent study by CoreLogic suggests that 25 percent of mortgages originated in 2010 had DTIs greater 
than 43 percent.  See Sam Khater (2013), “The Mortgage Market Impact of Qualified Mortgage 
Regulation,” The MarketPulse, vol. 2 (February), pp. 3-6, www.corelogic.com/downloadable-
docs/MarketPulse_2013-February.pdf.

potentially higher-priced loans may increase.  In 2006--admittedly, not one of the best 

years for prudent mortgage underwriting in this country--about 25 percent of 

conventional purchase mortgage originations were considered higher priced.12   

Lenders who prefer to price for risk through points and fees rather than increases 

in rates also face constraints in originating QMs.  Points and fees on a QM loan may not 

exceed 3 percent of the loan amount, with higher caps available for loans smaller than 

$100,000.  The “points and fees” definition has been expanded from its original 

definition in the Truth in Lending Act and now includes, for example, compensation paid 

to the loan originator in the form of a higher interest rate on the loan.  Unfortunately, data 

on points and fees are limited, so it is difficult to determine how many potential 

borrowers might be affected by this requirement. 

To be clear, many borrowers were overcharged or defrauded by lenders in the past 

decade, and these abuses were concentrated among the more vulnerable parts of the 

population.  It is a positive development if new regulations make such abuses more 

difficult.  Still, the costs associated with mortgage lending, especially to borrowers more 

likely to default, have increased, and if lenders cannot charge enough to recoup these 

costs, they may not be willing to make the loans at all.  As a result, the QM-related 

incentives against charging higher interest rates, points, or fees will likely affect more 

loans than in the past and may, in turn, have a greater effect on credit availability for 

higher-risk borrowers. 

To bring this discussion back to the effect on the housing market, I think the 

ability of newly formed households, which are more likely to have lower incomes or 

weaker credit scores, to access the mortgage market will make a big difference in the

shape of the recovery.  Economic improvement will cause household formation to 

increase, but if credit is hard to get, these will be rental rather than owner-occupied 

households.  And without first-time homebuyers, the move-up market will be sluggish, 

new and existing home sales will be more subdued, and purchase mortgage volumes will 

return only slowly. 

As I’ve noted, credit availability to newly formed households is being affected by 

a variety of economic, market, and regulatory factors.  Some of these factors are likely to 

ease, whereas others will be more permanent.  As a result, this housing recovery may 

look different than previous ones.  In particular, tighter mortgage credit and sustained 

investor interest in single-family rental properties may result in a lower homeownership 

rate than in the past.  However, the same regulations that could contribute to tighter 

mortgage credit should also ensure that more of those homeownership experiences 

succeed. 

The Role of Monetary Policy 

I would like to conclude with a brief discussion of the role of monetary policy in 

the housing recovery.  The fact that mortgage purchase originations have remained nearly 

flat at a time when interest rates have hit historic lows naturally raises the question of 

whether monetary policy is effective in stimulating the housing market and thereby the 

broader economy.  As I will explain next, I believe that the answer is yes. 

Monetary policy has clearly set the stage for a revival of the housing market.  

Record-low interest rates have sparked interest in homebuying.  Monetary policy has 

contributed significantly to the recent improvement in the labor market and thereby 

begun to ease one of the main sources of weak housing demand.  Monetary policy has

likely also supported investor demand for purchasing houses, as the expected return on an 

investment in housing is more likely to exceed the low yields available on Treasury 

securities and other debt instruments.  Households may be making the same calculus as 

investors. 

The interest-rate-sensitive housing market is affected by all of the tools of 

monetary policy, but purchases of agency MBS have a more direct effect on the mortgage 

market.  So, without delving deeply into monetary policy generally, I would like to make 

a few observations about the efficacy and costs of MBS purchases specifically.  In doing 

so, I want to reiterate that these are my views and may not be in accord with those of my 

colleagues on the FOMC.  

In many ways, purchases of MBS have the same downward effect on the general 

level of long-term interest rates as purchases of other longer-term securities.  But, in 

addition, purchases of agency MBS reduce the spread between Treasury and MBS yields 

and thus, compared with purchases of Treasury securities, have somewhat larger effects 

on mortgage rates.  This larger effect was especially true in the first round of purchases in 

2009 when investor uncertainty about the degree of government support for agency MBS 

was quite high.13  MBS purchases also influence MBS yields by affecting the cost of 

hedging the risk (known as convexity risk) that mortgages prepay more quickly when 

rates decline or more slowly when rates increase, because, unlike some mortgage market 

investors, the Federal Reserve does not hedge such risk.   

Lower MBS yields result in lower mortgage rates, which can spur the economy 

through elevated home-purchase and refinancing activity.  But this effect is not yet fully 

                                                 
13 See, for example, Diana Hancock and Wayne Passmore (2011), “Did the Federal Reserve’s MBS 
Purchase Program Lower Mortgage Rates?” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 58 (July), pp. 498-514.

transmitted to the economy, as the difference between MBS yields and mortgage rates is 

still somewhat wide and, as I discussed earlier, tight credit has prevented many 

households from accessing the low rates.  Any improvement in credit conditions would 

thus act to improve the efficacy of MBS purchases.  Similarly, policies that constrain 

mortgage lending or increase its cost would reduce efficacy. 

I think the additional impetus to housing from MBS purchases is appropriate for 

at least three reasons.  First, the housing market has suffered extraordinary damage 

during the past few years.  Second, even with the recent positive signs, housing 

investment has contributed far less to economic growth than in a typical recovery.  And, 

third, even as terms and standards on other types of credit have eased, standards for 

mortgage credit remain quite tight.  

While the purchase of agency MBS has some special efficacy in supporting 

housing markets, the peculiarities of the MBS market itself present some potential market 

functioning issues that bear monitoring.  The MBS market is not as deep or as liquid as 

the Treasury market, and the total size of the market is not growing as quickly.  As 

refinancing activity slows, the gross pace of new MBS issuance could slow as well, and 

Federal Reserve purchases at the current level could leave an even larger footprint in the 

secondary mortgage market.  So it is entirely possible that it might be appropriate at some 

point to adjust the pace of MBS purchases in response to developments in primary or 

secondary mortgage markets.  Within the context of the Committee’s judgment about the 

appropriate overall level of monetary accommodation, such an adjustment could result in 

an increase or decrease in the pace of total asset purchases, or it could lead to a change in 

the composition of purchases.

Finally, the statement of exit strategy principles provided in the June 2011 FOMC 

minutes contemplates the sale of MBS once the Committee has begun to remove policy 

accommodation in order to return the System Open Market Account to an all-Treasury 

portfolio.14  As our holdings of MBS become larger in both absolute terms and in relation 

to the overall supply of agency MBS outstanding, we could reach a point where market 

functioning concerns begin to outweigh the efficacy of such purchases.  Or we might 

conclude that sales of MBS in volumes sufficient to meet the parameters of the exit 

strategy principles might create significant market disruptions.  In either case, I think we 

should consider alternatives, such as holding the securities for longer or allowing them to 

roll off more gradually. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion, I am optimistic that the housing recovery will continue to take root 

and expand.  While low mortgage rates are helping support the recovery, I believe it will 

be the pent-up demand of household formation unleashed by improving economic 

conditions that will provide real momentum.  However, the strength of this momentum 

will be determined by credit availability to these new households, an availability that may 

be much slower to return as mortgage market participants assess the regulatory, market, 

and economic environment.  I think that if such credit is not readily available, the housing 

recovery will still continue, but the mix of owner-occupied and rental housing and the 

level of mortgage originations might be quite different.
