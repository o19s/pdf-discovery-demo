Good morning.  I am sorry that I am not able to be with you today at the FRBNY for this 

important meeting.  I thought that I would begin by discussing the LIBOR related events that 

have brought us here, and then talk about the way forward.   

LIBOR gained negative public attention when reports began to surface during the 

financial crisis that employees at some banks had attempted to manipulate the rate by altering the 

quotes they submitted for use in the calculation of LIBOR.  A number of agencies,  including the 

Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), the Department of Justice, and the U.K. 

Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), took the lead in investigating and prosecuting the cases of 

LIBOR manipulation that were uncovered.  The Federal Reserve also joined in international 

efforts to strengthen LIBOR.  Among other things, we joined the ICE Benchmark 

Administration’s (IBA’s) LIBOR Oversight Committee as an observer, and we also worked 

intensively with international authorities and IBA in developing and encouraging the reforms set 

out in IBA’s Roadmap for LIBOR.   

But at the same time, as we and other authorities collected data on the transactions 

underlying banks’ submissions to LIBOR, we began to see that those transactions were relatively 

few and far between.  As a result, many began to question whether LIBOR could be truly and 

permanently fixed.  To be sure, much has been done to address the cases of attempted 

manipulation, and LIBOR has much stronger governance in place than it did before the crisis.  

The question instead was whether there were enough actual LIBOR transactions to form a stable 

basis for this critical rate.  

Since many of the pressures around LIBOR stem from the low level of underlying 

transactions, let me share some data regarding activity in U.S. dollar wholesale funding markets.  

Today, there are 17 banks that submit quotes in support of dollar LIBOR. Some have suggested 


- 2 - 
 


requiring more banks to submit LIBOR data, but doing so would not materially improve the 

situation.  The panels in Figure 1 show the distribution of daily aggregate wholesale dollar 

funding volumes for the 30 global systemically important banks (or GSIBs).  The data here 

include all of the Eurodollar, federal funds, CD, and commercial paper transactions that the 

Federal Reserve has access to--the most complete picture of U.S. dollar unsecured funding that I 

am aware of.  For one-month funding, shown in the top panel, the median daily volume of 

transactions by these banks since money-market reforms took effect last year was just over $1 

billion.  For three-month funding (the middle panel), the most heavily referenced LIBOR tenor, 

the median is less than $1 billion per day.  On some days we see less than $100 million.  If we 

compare this to the more than $100 trillion in outstanding volumes of U.S. dollar LIBOR 

contracts, it should be clear that the activity in this market is miniscule compared to the size of 

the contracts written on it.    

In our view, it would not be feasible to produce a robust, transaction-based rate 

constructed from the activity in wholesale unsecured funding markets.  A transactions-based rate 

from this market would be fairly easy to manipulate given such a thin level of activity, and the 

rate itself would likely be quite volatile.  Thus, LIBOR seems consigned to rely primarily on 

some form of expert judgment rather than direct transactions.   

As we discussed these issues with the officials in the United Kingdom who oversee and 

regulate LIBOR, we also became aware that they were receiving a steady stream of requests, and 

sometimes demands, from banks seeking to leave the LIBOR panels.  The use of expert 

judgment in submissions allows LIBOR to be published every day, but many banks are now 

understandably uncomfortable with being asked to provide judgment about something that they 

do very little of.  In his July speech, Andrew Bailey discussed the efforts of the FCA to keep 


- 3 - 
 


these banks on the panels.  Market participants should understand that the official sector has 

done everything it can to stabilize and strengthen LIBOR.  Without the intervention of U.K. 

authorities, LIBOR would be in a weaker state today. 

But that balancing act has grown increasingly difficult.  As time has passed, some banks 

have grown more resistant to public-sector entreaties to remain on the panels.  As you know, one 

bank left the U.S. dollar panel last year.  At the same time, we have had to confront the fact that, 

if banks could not be persuaded to voluntarily remain on panels, then the legal powers to compel 

them to do so were limited.  Under European Union benchmark regulations, which LIBOR will 

soon be subject to, authorities can only compel submissions to a critical benchmark for a period 

of two years.  Given this time limit, brokering a voluntary agreement with the submitting banks 

to stay on for a longer period was the last, best choice that authorities had available to guarantee 

some further period of stability for LIBOR.  CFTC Chairman Chris Giancarlo and I have 

publicly supported the FCA’s efforts to secure an agreement with the submitting banks to stay on 

through the end of 2021, and we have encouraged the U.S. banks that submit to LIBOR to 

cooperate with FCA’s effort.   

Of course, LIBOR may remain viable well past 2021, but we do not think that market 

participants can safely assume that it will.  Users of LIBOR must now take in to account the risk 

that it may not always be published.  While the public’s understanding of this risk has increased 

significantly since Andrew Bailey’s speech, the official sector has been concerned about it for 

some years, as reflected for example in our public comments and in the annual reports of the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Given our understanding of the risks to LIBOR, the 

Federal Reserve convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (or ARRC) in 2014 in 

cooperation with the Treasury Department and CFTC.  Consistent with recommendations from 


- 4 - 
 


the Financial Stability Board (FSB), we charged the ARRC with identifying a robust alternative 

to U.S. dollar LIBOR and with developing a plan to encourage its use in some derivatives and 

other transactions as appropriate.   

The ARRC has accomplished the things that we asked of it.  I want to thank the members 

for their work and also to extend my special thanks to Sandie O’Connor as the chair of the 

ARRC.  Sandie will discuss the ARRC’s work shortly, but I’ll make a few points.   

First, I’d note that, like most market participants, the ARRC members initially had a 

difficult time conceiving of any kind of transition from LIBOR.  As is the case for all of you, a 

transition will be a complicated task for the broker-dealers and other members of the ARRC, and 

will involve significant costs.  Over time, however, I think the ARRC members have developed a 

greater understanding of the risks to LIBOR and now see that, despite those complications and 

costs, a transition may prove necessary.  I also think that, having had time to consider the 

transition plans that Sandie will talk about, ARRC members have become more comfortable with 

the idea that a transition is feasible, even if the necessity of achieving it is regrettable.  

  Second, it is clear that any rate the ARRC selected as a potential alternative needed to be 

highly robust.  There would be no point in selecting a rate that might find itself quickly in the 

same kinds of conditions that LIBOR is in now.  In our view, the ARRC has chosen the most 

robust rate available.  In general, only overnight unsecured or secured funding markets appeared 

to have enough underlying transactions to produce a robust rate.  The overnight Treasury repo 

market is the largest and most active market in any tenor of U.S. rates markets.  Figure 2 

illustrates the point:  the transactions underlying the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), 

at about $700 billion per day or more, are much larger than the volumes in overnight unsecured 

markets, even much larger than estimates of the volume in Treasury bills, and they dwarf the 


- 5 - 
 


volumes in other term markets.  The alternative reference rate needs to be able to stand the 

weight of having trillions of dollars written on it, and the ARRC has definitely met this standard 

in choosing SOFR.   

 Third, we charged the ARRC with devising plans for a voluntary transition that 

encouraged the use of their recommended rate where appropriate.  We have never told anyone 

that they cannot use LIBOR.  The ARRC did consider whether other cash products could move 

from LIBOR to the rates it evaluated, but their paced transition plan has focused on derivatives 

because that is where the largest gross exposures to LIBOR are, and because it may be easier for 

many derivatives transactions to move away from LIBOR to a new rate.   

Now, however, market participants have realized that they may need to more seriously 

consider transitioning other products away from LIBOR, and the ARRC has expanded its work 

to help ensure that this can be done in a coordinated way that avoids unnecessary disruptions.  

Sandie will discuss plans to eventually create a term reference rate, which may help to smooth 

any transition.   That term reference rate would have to be built by first developing futures and 

OIS markets that reference SOFR.  It will likely never be as robust as SOFR itself, and so 

derivatives transactions will almost certainly need to be based on the overnight rate, but a term 

reference rate could conceivably be used in some loan or other contracts that currently reference 

LIBOR.   

All of the work that we will talk about today will help, but we have to acknowledge that 

the transition will be complicated.  Unfortunately, as I have discussed, we cannot guarantee that 

it won’t be necessary.  The most complicated aspects involve the legacy contracts that reference 

LIBOR, many of which do not have strong language in place if LIBOR were to stop publication.  

The FSB has been working with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (or ISDA) 


- 6 - 
 


to devise better language for derivatives, and ISDA’s Scott O’Malia and Katherine Tew Darras 

will discuss that work later this morning.  As people now consider the risks around LIBOR for 

other types of contracts, they will need to go through their documentation to understand what the 

fallback language is and how it can be improved.  We will also discuss those issues today.  This 

is important work, both for the parties to these contracts and for our financial stability.  While 

there may be no perfect contract language or fallback, good risk management requires that we 

work together to find language and fallbacks that are robust and that limit unintended valuation 

changes.  

So, while much work has been done, there is more still to do.  I have been heartened in 

seeing that many market participants are already confronting these issues.  For some, Andrew 

Bailey’s speech was a difficult wake-up call.  But the efforts we have undertaken with the ARRC 

show what is possible when the official sector works collectively with market participants.  If 

market participants are willing to continue to work together, then we can safely achieve the 

transitions needed to create a better and more robust system that will help to ensure our ongoing 

financial stability.
