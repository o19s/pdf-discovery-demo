Why Persistent Employment Disparities Matter for the Economy’s Health 

Remarks by

at 

“Disparities in the Labor Market: What Are We Missing?” 
a research conference sponsored by the 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

Washington, D.C. 

September 26, 2017 



I want to compliment the organizers and others for gathering an outstanding group 

of researchers and papers for this conference.  Understanding why some groups 

persistently fare better than others in the job market and how these disparities may affect 

the economy’s overall performance is vitally important to the Federal Reserve.  While 

opportunity and inclusion have long been central to American values, it is increasingly 

clear that they are also central to the strength of our economy.1   

As directed by the Congress, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate is to promote 

maximum employment and stable prices.  In fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a 

similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum employment.  That is because the level of 

maximum employment depends on “nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and 

dynamics of the labor market,” which “may change over time and may not be directly 

measurable.”2  Understanding how close the labor market is to our full-employment goal 

requires consulting a variety of evidence along with a healthy dose of judgment.  The 

recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes in the 

economic landscape serves us well by requiring FOMC participants to develop a nuanced 

understanding of labor market developments.   

This approach to maximum employment has allowed the FOMC to navigate the 

current expansion in a way that has likely brought more people back into productive 

employment than might have been the case with a fixed unemployment rate target based

on pre-crisis standards.  This is especially true at a time when the traditional Phillips 

curve relationship is flatter than in the past, which means that price inflation is likely to 

be less informative regarding labor market tightness than it was previously.3  It therefore 

seems particularly valuable to look beyond inflation and headline unemployment to 

assess the strength of the labor market.  Even when aggregate economic statistics look 

strong, studying geographic areas and demographic groups that are not faring as well can 

point to ways of further improving the economy’s performance. 

The Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor 

force participation, income, and wealth because they may have implications for the 

growth capacity of the economy.  When we consider appropriate monetary policy, we 

need to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive 

price inflation.  At a time when the retirement of the baby-boom generation looks likely 

to be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to 

consider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for 

some prime working-age groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could 

increase the labor force and boost economic activity.  

More broadly, when a person who was previously unemployed or discouraged 

secures a job, not only does it boost the economy, but that person also may gain a greater 

sense of economic security, self-sufficiency, and self-worth and be better able to invest in 

their family’s future.  With a richer understanding of economic or social barriers that 

inhibit labor market success and prosperity for some groups, we may better grasp how

much these individuals can be helped by broad economic expansion and how much 

targeted intervention is required through other policy means.   

There is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth 

rate and equality of opportunity.  Large disparities in opportunity based on race, ethnicity, 

gender, or geography mean that the enterprise, exertion, and investments of households 

and businesses from different groups are not rewarded commensurately.  To the extent 

that disparities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect 

such disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged 

groups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth 

will fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.4   

Aside from reducing the long-run productive potential of the economy, 

persistently high levels of income and wealth inequality may also have implications for 

the robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of aggregate 

spending in the United States.  The gaps in household income and wealth between the 

richest and poorest households are at historically high levels, as income and wealth have 

increasingly accrued to the very richest households.  For example, results from the 

Federal Reserve’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is due to be released 

soon, indicate that the share of income held by the top 1 percent of households reached 

24 percent in 2015, up from 17 percent in 1988.  The share of wealth held by the top 

1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.5  Some research 

suggests that widening income and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in

the aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of 

any additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are 

likely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.6   

Disparities by Race and Ethnicity 

 When we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we find 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.7  In August, the national 

unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked 

substantial differences across different demographic groups.  As shown in figure 1, 

unemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians, 

5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 7.7 percent for African Americans.  Labor force 

participation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than 

unemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at 62.2 percent.  These 

differences are not a recent development--similar differences across racial and ethnic 

dimensions have existed for as long as these data have been collected.  Even more 

striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic 

groups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age 

and education levels.8   

 Although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups 

are still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably 

during the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades.  Differences in 

unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during 

                                                 
6 See Bernstein (2013) and Alichi, Kantenga, and Solè (2016) for more on the potential link between 
income and wealth inequality and consumer spending.

8 See Cajner and others (2017) for more on racial gaps and the labor market.

recessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and 

these differences shrink during recoveries.  For example, in the second quarter of 2017, 

the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 percentage points 

higher than for white adult men.  This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to 

the smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.  

Differences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women 

relative to white women, and for Hispanics relative to whites.  Since racial disparities 

tend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that 

racial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall 

unemployment rate falls further.9   

More broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in families’ income and wealth.  

According to forthcoming findings from the latest SCF and as shown in figure 3, the 

average income for white families in 2015 was about $123,000 per year, compared with 

$54,000 for black families and $57,000 for Hispanic families.10  Disparities in wealth, 

shown in figure 4, are even larger:  Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016 

were about $933,000, compared with $191,000 for Hispanic families and $138,000 for 

black families.11  Moreover, these racial and ethnic gaps in average family income and 

                                                 
9 Data on recent estimates of unemployment rates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity 
are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Historical gaps are provided by Cajner and others 
(2017). 
10 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data.  Recent estimates of household income from Current 
Population Survey data and reported by the Census in Semega, Fontenot, and Kollar (2017) are 
qualitatively similar, in that between 2013 and 2016 for both sets of data, family income has increased for 
whites, blacks, and Hispanics (with greater increases, in percentage terms, for black and Hispanic families). 
11 Racial and ethnic differences in median income and wealth are somewhat smaller.  For example, in 2016 
median income for white families was about $61,000, compared with $35,000 for black families and 
$39,000 for Hispanic families.  Median wealth was about $171,000 for white families, compared with

wealth have generally widened rather than narrowed over the past few decades.  Based on 

SCF data, median family wealth has grown much more rapidly for white families than for 

other families over the past few decades, while median family incomes have risen by 

about the same amount for white, black, and Hispanic families.   

As the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the 

sidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in 

employment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue.  

That said, the benefits of a lengthy recovery can only go so far, as the research points to 

some barriers to labor market outcomes for particular groups that appear to be structural.  

After controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these 

factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and 

informal social networks that may be an important source of information and support 

regarding employment opportunities.12  While the policy tools available to the Federal 

Reserve are not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent 

disparities in labor market outcomes, understanding these barriers and efforts to address 

them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth.   

Geographic Disparities   

The Federal Reserve System benefits not only from our engagement with 

research, statistics, and surveys, but also from our presence in communities all across 

America.  This local presence, by design, provides valuable perspectives on how 

Americans in different communities are experiencing the economy and the varied 

                                                 
about $20,000 for black and Hispanic families. The larger gap in average income and wealth than median 
income and wealth reflects a greater concentration of income and wealth among the wealthiest white 
families than for other races and ethnicities. 
12 For example, see Fryer (2011) and Ritter and Taylor (2011).

challenges that lie beneath the aggregate numbers.  While traveling around the country 

with our community development staff, I have been struck by the widening gulf between 

the economic fortunes of our large metropolitan areas and those of our small cities, 

towns, and rural areas. 

The statistics bear this out. Over the past 30 years, the convergence in income 

across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.13  Much of the gains in 

employment, income, and wealth since the end of the recession, and more broadly over 

the past few decades, have accrued to workers and families in larger cities.  Since some 

workers and families may find it difficult to move, this concentration of economic 

opportunities in larger cities may have adverse implications for the well-being of these 

households and, potentially, the growth capacity of the economy as a whole.   

  Although pockets of opportunity and poverty are found in large metropolitan and 

rural areas alike, a greater share of the new jobs and business establishments created 

during the recovery that followed the Great Recession have been in larger metro areas 

than was the case in previous recoveries.14  In countless rural towns and small cities we 

are seeing how a deep economic setback can leave a profound and long-lasting mark.  

These experiences challenge common assumptions about the ability of local economies to 

recover from a setback.  This could be the legacy of the concentrated presence of an 

industry that experiences decline due to trade or technology, or it could be the byproduct 

of a lack of connectivity--whether by highways or broadband.  Technological change, 

globalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to the U.S. economy, but 

                                                 
13 See Ganong and Shoag (2017) and references therein for more on the decline in income convergence. 
14 See Goetz, Partridge, and Stephens (2017) and Economic Innovation Group (2016) for details on 
growing regional differences during the recovery.

there are troubling signs that less diversified or connected localities have a diminished 

ability to adapt.  And the evidence suggests that concentrated economic shocks and the 

associated labor market stress also have broader consequences for health and mortality.15   

 To provide some sense of the magnitudes, on average over the past year the 

unemployment rate for adults of prime working age (25 to 54) was about 1 percentage 

point higher in nonmetropolitan areas than in larger metro areas.16  But there is an even 

greater gap in labor force engagement, as can be seen in figure 5.  The participation rate 

for prime-age adults in larger metro areas is currently nearly 3-1/2 percentage points 

above the participation rate for prime-age adults in nonmetro areas.  Interestingly, the 

geographic participation rate gap between more and less populous areas is apparent for 

all races as well as, in recent years, for both men and women.17 

 This gap in labor force participation between large cities and other areas has 

widened substantially since just before the Great Recession:  Since 2007, the 

participation rate for prime-age adults in nonmetro areas has fallen nearly 3 percentage 

points, as compared with less than 1 percentage point on net in larger metro areas.  

Indeed, since 2007, the large decline in labor force participation in small metro and rural 

areas can explain about 40 percent of the economy-wide decline in prime-age labor force 

participation, even though these areas account for a smaller 25 percent of the population. 

Before discussing possible contributors to this growing participation gap, it is 

important to emphasize that less populous areas appear to be falling behind in ways 

                                                 
15 See Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Pierce and Schott (2016b). 
16 Larger metro areas are defined as metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with a population of 500,000 or 
larger, while smaller metro areas are MSAs with population between 100,000 and 500,000, and nonmetro 
areas are the remainder; see Weingarden (2017).   
17 This gap appears to be a post-crisis phenomenon for women, while for men the gap began to widen in the 
1990s.

beyond these employment outcomes.  Based on forthcoming SCF data, for example, the 

average annual income for families in metro areas was about $54,000 higher than for 

families in nonmetro areas, and the average wealth holdings for families in metro areas 

exceeded average wealth for families in nonmetro areas by nearly $500,000--and these 

gaps have more than doubled over the past three decades.18  The gaps in many other 

measures of well-being have widened as well.  In small towns and rural areas, college 

attainment rates have increased by less, disability rates have increased by more, divorce 

rates have risen by more, and mortality due to lung disease, cancer, or cardiovascular 

disease have either improved by less or worsened by more.19  Opioid use is also most 

prevalent in less populous metro and rural areas.20   

I have seen many of these challenges first hand.  In the small towns and hollers of 

eastern Kentucky, I visited with community development financial institutions that are 

trying to plug the gap in access to credit so that small businesses can continue operating 

and hiring locally, and so that families can access housing that is safe and affordable.  In 

rural communities in the Mississippi Delta, I learned about diminished access to financial 

services available to rural residents, which can be a barrier to housing and business 

investment and pose vexing challenges to local governments.  In Texas, I learned about 

barriers to economic development in the rural colonias areas on the southern border 

associated with underinvestment in physical and broadband infrastructure.21   

18 Staff estimates from forthcoming SCF data.  Although the difference in average income and wealth has 
grown, there has been little change in differences in median family income and wealth in larger metros 
relative to other areas.  The widening gap for average income and wealth, but not for median income and 
wealth, is because in larger metro areas income and wealth has become increasingly held by wealthier 
families.

As we consider the long-term health of the U.S. economy, it is important to better 

understand the decade-long decline in aggregate labor force participation.  It is striking 

that in larger metro areas, the labor force participation rate for prime-age men has 

recently retraced much of the decline experienced during the recession, while in smaller 

metro and rural areas, the labor force participation rate remains well below its pre-

recession level, with only modest improvements of late.  The evidence increasingly 

suggests that much of the decline relates to a sustained decline in job opportunities for 

prime-age men, especially less-educated prime-age men, resulting in languishing wages 

relative to other groups.22  Indeed, it is notable that the striking decrease in labor force 

participation rates for nonmetro areas relative to large metro areas is highly concentrated 

among adults with no more than a high school education, who comprise a larger share of 

the prime-age population in nonmetro areas.  The labor force participation rate for adults 

with no more than a high school education has fallen to 72 percent in nonmetro areas--

about 3-1/2 percent below larger metro areas.23 

Although the precise causes of this decline are still not fully settled, one 

contributing factor is advancing automation and computerization.24  Another contributor 

is globalization.  For example, a growing body of research has identified a steeper decline 

in the employment and labor force attachment of prime-age men in areas of the country 

22 Most analysis suggests that at least half of the decline in the aggregate labor force participation rate since 
2007 is attributable to the aging of the population, with a significant portion of the decline that is not 
related to aging attributable to a longer-run decline in participation for younger individuals and prime-age 
men; for example, see Aaronson and others (2014) and the Council of Economic Advisors (2014).  For an 
overview of factors potentially attributable to the decline in labor force participation of prime-age men, see 
the Council of Economic Advisors (2016). 
23 These estimates are based on data from Weingarden (2017). 
24 For an overview of factors that have potentially impacted job opportunities for this group, see Autor 
(2010).  For examples of research on the recent labor market effects of technology and automation, see 
Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2015) and Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017).

that specialized in the industries that were most negatively affected by increased imports 

from China.25   

Research suggests that some of the decline in prime-age labor force participation 

relates to some individuals’ reduced ability or desire to work, in some cases resulting 

directly from the ongoing decline in job opportunities.  There are many reasons why 

some prime-age men may be less willing or able to work.  One possibility is that the 

unusually long spells of nonemployment associated with the Great Recession may have 

eroded job skills and informal employment networks.  Another possibility that is 

increasingly in focus is that physical disabilities, as well as sharp increases in opioid use, 

have increasingly inhibited some individuals from participating in the labor force.  The 

fraction of prime-age men receiving disability insurance benefits has increased from 

1 percent in the late 1970s to 3 percent more recently.26  Recent research also finds that 

among all prime-age men who are not in the labor force, about one-third reported having 

at least one disability, and nearly one-half reported taking pain medications daily.27  

These supply-side explanations may be related to the drop in labor demand:  the despair 

related to diminished prospects of a stable and quality job may lead to substance abuse 

and related health or mortality concerns.28 

25 For national-level estimates of the labor market effects from cheaper Chinese imports, see Pierce and 
Schott (2016a) and Acemoglu and others (2016).  For evidence related to cross-country differences in these 
effects, see Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013), and Pierce and Schott (2016b). 
26 See Council of Economic Advisors (2016). 
27 Krueger (forthcoming) describes evidence from a variety of surveys showing that a significant fraction of 
prime-age men who are out of the labor force report having pain, being in poor health, or taking medication 
related to this pain, and that these behaviors are far more common among prime-age men than prime-age 
women. 
28 See Case and Deaton (2015, 2017). 


- 12 -

At least some of these explanations potentially relate to the growing divide 

between large metro areas and other areas of the country.  As noted earlier, the opioid 

epidemic appears to be particularly acute in smaller cities and rural areas.  In addition, 

employment in non-metro areas tends to be more concentrated in manufacturing, which is 

the sector that has experienced the largest decline in employment from automation and 

globalization.29  Similarly, research suggests that workers in less populous areas have 

been more likely to be directly affected by increased import competition from China due 

to the geographical distribution of industries.30  And for many less populous areas, job 

opportunities are less diverse than in bigger cities, so that when a plant shuts down, there 

are fewer local alternative job opportunities for unemployed workers, especially with 

comparable levels of employment security or benefits.   

These striking results naturally raise the question of whether we are seeing 

heightened migration from the less populous areas to the larger metros with greater 

economic opportunity.  A conventional assumption in economics is that regional 

differences should narrow over time as workers move toward areas where jobs are more 

plentiful and wages are higher.31  In reality, Americans’ propensity to move is currently 

at its lowest level in many decades.  In 2016, the fraction of the population that had 

moved within the United States in the past year was 11 percent, down from 17 percent or 

more in the early 1980s, with the steepest decline in the fraction of people moving longer 

distances, across county or state lines.32  The evidence suggests that the decline in 

29 Based on staff analysis of publically available data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on 
metropolitan and nonmetropolitan employment by industry. 
30 This observation reflects unpublished calculations from Pierce and Schott (2016b). 
31 See Blanchard and Katz (1992). 
32 Data on internal migration rates come from the Current Population Survey and are published annually by 
the Census Bureau; see “Table A-1.  Annual Geographic Mobility Rates, by Type of Movement:  1948-
2016,” https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/geographic-mobility/historic.html.  


- 13 -

geographic mobility cannot be fully explained by population aging, by the housing boom 

and bust, by changes in the composition of industries, by the increasing ease of 

telecommuting from longer distances, or by the rise in dual-earner households which may 

make work-related relocation more difficult.  Some of the decline may be related to 

changes in the labor market, perhaps because workers are more likely to perceive that job 

opportunities are no better elsewhere, and consequently that the labor market returns to 

switching jobs or locations--in terms of better wages or higher job quality--have 

declined.33  Also, zoning requirements may be boosting housing costs in cities where job 

opportunities are most abundant, such as San Francisco, pricing out many potential 

workers and inhibiting migration.34 

Whatever the reason, the fact that families are less likely to move now than in the 

past suggests that many of those in less populous areas are not able to access the 

economic opportunity present in denser and more diversified large metropolitan areas at a 

time when the gap in labor market outcomes for larger metros relative to other areas 

continues to grow.   

Federal Reserve Work on Labor Market Disparities 

The Federal Reserve is deeply engaged in understanding disparities through our 

data collection, research collaboration, and community development work.  One way the 

Federal Reserve seeks to obtain a clearer picture is by collecting data ourselves.  For 

instance, some of the data I have cited today come from the Federal Reserve’s triennial 

Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides detailed information on income and 

33 For a discussion of the multidecade decline in internal migration and its potential causes, see Molloy, 
Smith, and Wozniak (2011, 2017) and Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2017).

wealth holdings by demographic groups.  The Survey of Household Economics and 

Decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, employment, housing, and 

debt; the Survey of Young Workers provides insights into younger adults’ employment 

experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the Enterprising and Informal Work 

Activities Survey provides information about income generating activities that are often 

outside the scope of other employment and income surveys.35   

Across the Federal Reserve System, a variety of initiatives are aimed at 

understanding economic disparities and how to foster more-inclusive growth.  The 

Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 

brings together researchers from a variety of fields to analyze barriers to economic 

opportunity and advancement.  The Economic Growth and Mobility Project at the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia aims to bring together researchers with community 

stakeholders to focus on differences in poverty and economic mobility across 

demographic characteristics.  The Investing in America’s Workforce Initiative is a 

collaboration between the Federal Reserve System and academic research institutions to 

promote investment in workforce skills that better align with employers’ needs.36 

All of that brings me to today’s conference, which I am confident will make an 

important contribution to this mission.  I am heartened to see so many researchers and 

35 Further information on these surveys are found on the Board’s website; see the Surveys of Consumer 
Finances, https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm; the Survey of Household Economics and 
Decisionmaking, https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm; the Survey of Young

practitioners from a variety of backgrounds focused on these important issues.  This 

conference is part of our efforts to hear from experts with diverse backgrounds and 

perspectives to better understand the nature and implications of labor market disparities. 

A deeper understanding of labor market disparities is central to the mission of the 

Federal Reserve because it may help us better assess full employment, where resources 

may be underutilized, and the likely evolution of the labor market and overall economic 

activity.  We look forward to hearing what you have to say about these important 

questions and learning what other questions are in need of attention. 

Note: On September 27, 2017, a typo was corrected to change $25,000 to $54,000 in the following 
sentence on page 9: "Based on forthcoming SCF data, for example, the average annual income for 
families in metro areas was about $54,000 higher than for families in nonmetro areas, and the average 
wealth holdings for families in metro areas exceeded average wealth for families in nonmetro areas by 
nearly $500,000--and these gaps have more than doubled over the past three decades." The original 
number incorrectly stated the median instead of the mean.
