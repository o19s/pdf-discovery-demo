Thank you very much to the Institute of International Bankers for inviting me to speak 

here today.  Among my first areas of focus when I was a very young lawyer starting out in my 

career well over 30 years ago was providing advice to foreign banks and financial firms 

operating in the United States, and I learned then just how integral, essential, and welcome a part 

your firms play in our domestic financial sector.  Non-U.S. firms serve as an important source of 

credit to U.S. households and businesses and contribute materially to the strength and liquidity of 

U.S. financial markets, so it is critical--not just as a matter of fairness but as a matter of our 

domestic interest--that we as regulators ensure that they operate in a fair and open financial 

services sector.  I view that as an important part of my job.  

So today I want to share my perspective on the appropriate regulatory environment for 

foreign banks operating in the United States, as well as some thoughts on specific elements of 

that regime.  Before doing that though, we should take stock of the pre-crisis history of foreign 

firms operating in the United States.   

First, the financial crisis revealed that in times of stress, international banking firms with 

large and complex local operations can contribute to instability in those local markets and can 

require extraordinary support from local authorities.  Second, a number of foreign financial 

institutions expanded the size and complexity of their U.S. operations at a rousing pace and scale 

prior to the crisis, and we did not adjust our local regulatory and supervisory approaches to 

address the increased risk associated with this expansion.  As a result, the difficulties faced by 

the U.S. operations of non-U.S. banks during the crisis mirrored that of their similarly sized 

domestic counterparts, underscoring a need for increased resiliency of both domestic firms and 

the U.S. operations of foreign banks.

To bolster that resiliency, the environment for foreign banks operating in the United 

States underwent a number of changes.  While there are important differences, those changes for 

foreign firms broadly parallel many of the changes instituted for domestic firms.  My Federal 

Reserve colleagues and I have termed these the core post-crisis regulatory reforms: capital, 

liquidity, stress testing, and resolution planning.1  Of course, the obvious and most prominent 

difference for foreign firms--as attendees of this conference certainly know--was the introduction 

of the intermediate holding company (IHC) structure, to which the post-crisis regulatory reforms 

apply. 

In my estimation, these reforms have gone a long way toward meeting our goal of a more 

resilient financial system.  That said, we are now at a point--with ten years of experience in 

setting up and living with the body of post-crisis regulation--where it is both relevant and timely 

to examine the post-crisis reforms and identify what is working well and what can be improved.  

If none of the regulatory measures implemented up to now were capable of improvement, this 

would be the first project of this scale and complexity conducted that had been done exactly right 

the first pass through.  If there was still work to be done after Hammurabi, there is probably still 

some work to be done now after Dodd and Frank.  In particular, as I have said elsewhere, we 

should be looking to see where we can achieve our regulatory objectives in ways that maintain 

our measures’ effectiveness, but improve their efficiency, transparency, and simplicity.  As part 

of that effort, we will consider additional tailoring and flexibility of our regulations in light of

their impact on foreign banking organizations (FBOs) based on lessons learned over the past 

several years.   

  To illustrate how I am thinking about these issues, I want to focus in my remarks today 

on two specific regulatory examples.  These are, of course, not an exhaustive list of work to be 

done in the regulation of FBOs, but they tend to be near the top of the feedback list from both the 

industry and supervisors.  First, I will discuss the application of enhanced prudential standards to 

FBOs, including our flexibility in implementing certain aspects of these standards.  I will also 

offer some initial thoughts on opportunities for further tailoring that regime for FBOs.  Second is 

the Volcker rule.  I will provide some of my initial thinking on how we might be able to improve 

the Volcker rule, both generally and in its application to FBOs in particular.     

Enhanced Prudential Standards 

In implementing enhanced prudential standards for foreign banks with a large U.S. 

presence, we sought to ensure that firms hold sufficient local capital and liquidity--and have a 

risk management infrastructure--that is commensurate with the risks in their U.S. operations.2  

And in general, that approach is meeting many of the broad goals the Federal Reserve set out to 

achieve.  Today, foreign banks with large U.S. operations are less fragmented, maintain local 

capital and liquidity buffers that align to the size and riskiness of their U.S. footprint, and operate 

on equal footing with their domestic counterparts. 

                                                            
2  The U.S. intermediate holding company structure provided for consistent application of capital, liquidity, and 
other prudential requirements and consistent supervision across the U.S. subsidiary operations of an FBO.  See 12 
USC 5365; Enhanced Prudential Standards for Bank Holding Companies and Foreign Banking Organizations, 79 
Fed. Reg. 17,240 (March 27, 2014).

Our current approach aligns with other jurisdictions that host a large and complex foreign 

bank presence.  For example, the European subsidiaries of U.S. banking firms have long been 

subject to Basel-based standards imposed by the European Union and the United Kingdom as 

host regulators.  In addition, European regulators are contemplating a holding company structure 

for the local operations of foreign banks to reduce fragmentation and ensure effective local 

supervision, similar in many ways to Federal Reserve rules.  

In adopting the enhanced prudential standards, however, the Board has acknowledged 

both the uniqueness of FBOs--as the U.S. operations are a small part of a larger firm--and the 

diversity of foreign bank operations in the United States.  The Board contemplated from the 

outset that circumstances may require application of the rule’s requirements to be adjusted in 

light of an individual firm’s structure or risk profile.  The Board has exercised this authority in 

the past, and I want to stress that we will continue to provide flexibility where appropriate to 

accommodate these differences.   

For instance, in implementing enhanced risk management standards, we have focused on 

outcomes--a strong control environment for foreign bank operations in the United States--while 

providing some flexibility in how those outcomes are achieved.  We have allowed the global risk 

committee to serve as the risk committee for the U.S. operations rather than require the creation 

of a standalone committee.  Further, for foreign banks with large U.S. branches but no IHC, the 

Board has acknowledged the challenges associated with the location of the risk committee.  The 

Board has accordingly allowed risk committees at U.S. holding companies as well as managerial 

committees located in the United States, provided that the global board provided appropriate 


- 6 - 
 


oversight.3  We are committed to continuing this outcomes-focused approach and to refining it 

where needed. 

Further, we recognize that effective stress testing regimes can take many different forms, 

specifically when interpreting the home-country stress testing requirements of the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Board has acknowledged, for example, 

that a foreign bank’s internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) may meet the 

minimum standards, provided that the firm’s ICAAP is on a consolidated basis and reviewed by 

the home country regulator.   

In addition, while we believe that the IHC requirement serves a valuable role in ensuring 

consistency of regulation across U.S. operations of an FBO, the Board has reserved authority to 

approve multiple IHCs if circumstances warrant based on the FBO’s activities, scope of 

operations, structure, home country regulatory framework, or similar considerations.  For 

example, the Board’s enhanced prudential standards rule contemplates allowing multiple IHCs in 

cases where home country legal requirements inhibit the combination of certain bank and 

nonbank operations.   

In practice, and in several instances, the Board has permitted a foreign bank to maintain 

certain U.S. subsidiaries outside of its IHC, so long as the foreign bank did not have practical 

control over that subsidiary.4  In addition, the Board recently approved an application by a 

foreign bank for a second IHC.  Part of our rationale for approving the dual IHC structure was 

                                                            
3 See 12 CFR 252.155(a)(3) (requiring an FBO with U.S. branches and agencies and combined U.S. assets of        
$50 billion or more to maintain its risk committee as a committee of the board of directors of its U.S. intermediate 
holding company (as applicable) or as a committee or the global board of directors (or equivalent thereof)); see also

dated October 19, 2016, related to the risk committee requirement.

the enhancement of recovery and resolution options of the global firm.  In granting the 

exception, the Board applied enhanced prudential standards to the two IHCs in the same manner 

that would apply to a single IHC, to maintain a level playing field and align incentives for the 

safe and sound operation of both IHCs.  This approach allows us more flexibility in addressing 

firm-specific structure needs, while maintaining the goals of the enhanced prudential standards 

more generally.  We will continue to consider future applications based on the merits of the case.  

Finally, to the extent that foreign banks have decided to reduce the scope of their U.S. 

operations to reduce the application of some of the enhanced prudential standards, the Board has 

accommodated requests for extended transition periods, so as to avoid unnecessary investments 

in infrastructure that ultimately would not be required by regulation. 

We are committed to tailoring our regulatory and supervisory regimes to align with the 

risk posed by financial institutions to the U.S. financial system.  We are also continuing to 

evaluate whether our rules are sensitive to changes in the risk profile of banking organizations.  

We want our rules both to increase in stringency as firms’ risks grow and, just as important, to 

decrease in stringency when firms have actively reduced their risk profiles.   

The Volcker Rule 

 Let me turn now to the Volcker rule.  Not to put too fine a point on it, but I believe the 

regulation implementing the Volcker rule is an example of a complex regulation that is not 

working well. 

 The fundamental premise of the Volcker rule is simple: banks with access to the federal 

safety net--Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance and the Federal Reserve discount 

window--should not engage in risky, speculative trading for their own account.  Whatever one’s 


- 8 - 
 


view of this basic premise, it is the law of the land.  Taking that premise as a given, we have to 

ask how to improve the framework of the implementing regulation to make it more workable and 

less burdensome in practice from both a compliance and supervisory perspective.   

 I think we all can agree that the implementing regulation is exceedingly complex.  As one 

example of specifics, among many, the statute and implementing regulation’s approach to 

defining “market making-related activities” rests on a number of complex requirements that are 

difficult or impossible to verify objectively in real time.  As a result, banks spend far too much 

time and energy contemplating whether particular transactions or positions are consistent with 

the Volcker rule.     

Some of you may quite sensibly be asking, “If the deficiencies of the regulation are so 

apparent, how did we get here?”  Despite the best of intentions in crafting the regulations, no one 

seems to be happy with the complex rule we wound up with.  This has a very positive 

consequence:  I have heard nothing but support from all of my regulatory colleagues for the 

proposition that the regulation is overly complex and would benefit from streamlining and 

simplifying to improve its workability in practice.   

We are actively working with our fellow regulators in seeking ways to further tailor and 

to reduce burden, particularly for firms that do not have large trading operations and do not 

engage in the sorts of activities that may give rise to proprietary trading.  We also appreciate the 

broad extraterritorial impact of the rule in its current form for foreign banks’ operations outside 

of the United States.  To that end, we have, with the full cooperation of all five Volcker 

regulatory agencies, picked back up the process that was begun last fall to engage in a 

rulemaking process subject to the Administrative Procedures Act and develop a proposal for 

public comment that would make material changes to the Volcker rule regulations.  In that 


- 9 - 
 


process we will take account of our own experience with the regulations since implementation, 

and we also want to take account of the views of market participants and other interested parties 

with views on the Volcker rule, including what is working and what is not.  We expect this 

process will proceed with dispatch. 

 We must also work within the confines of the statute.  For example, a number of my 

current and former Federal Reserve Board colleagues have expressed support for Congress 

providing an exemption from the Volcker rule for community banks, which is something I also 

support. 5  Short of a statutory exemption, we can only do our best to mitigate burden on 

community banks that generally do not engage in the types of activities the Volcker rule was 

intended to cover.6  Statutory changes likely would make our work of streamlining more 

straightforward and complete, but we have a fair bit that we can accomplish even absent such 

changes.  

 What are some of the improvements that we are thinking about that would be possible 

within the regulation itself?  As an initial matter, it should be clearer and more transparent what 

is subject to the Volcker rule’s implementing regulation and what is not.  The definition of key 

terms like “proprietary trading” and “covered fund” should be as simple and clear as possible.  It

Community Bankers Conference, New York, NY, May 14, 2015), 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20150514a.htm. (“I believe community banks should not face 
significant burdens from complying with these requirements, so I support raising the asset threshold for both the 
Volcker rule and incentive compensation rules, perhaps to $10 billion. In the event where the actions of a 
community bank might raise concerns in either of these areas, that could be addressed through our normal 
examination process.”); see also Daniel K. Tarullo, “Departing Thoughts,” (speech at The Woodrow Wilson School, 
Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, April 4, 2017), 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20170404a.htm. (“The third problem, also in the statute, is that 
the Volcker rule applies to a much broader group of banks than is necessary to achieve its purpose. As I have said 
before, the concerns underlying the Volcker rule are simply not an issue at community banks.”)

should not be a guessing game or require hours of legal analysis of complex banking and 

securities regulations to determine if a particular entity is a covered fund.  It should not happen--

although it has happened--that our supervised firms come to us and ask questions about whether 

a particular derivative trade is subject to the rule, and we cannot give them our own answer or a 

consistent answer across the five responsible agencies.  Supervisors need to be able to provide 

clear and transparent guidance on what is covered by the Volcker rule and what is not.  This 

would benefit not only the firms, but the supervisors at the agencies as well.   

 Again, a good example is the exemption for market making-related activities, which is 

one of the key exemptions from the prohibition on proprietary trading.  The rule contains a 

gaggle of complex regulatory requirements, but the statute contains merely one--that the market 

making-related activities are designed not to exceed the reasonably expected near-term demands 

of clients, customers, or counterparties, otherwise known as RENT’D.7  We are considering 

different ways to use a clearer test for RENT’D.  We want banks to be able to engage in market 

making and provide liquidity to financial markets with less fasting and prayer about their 

compliance with the Volcker rule.       

 As I noted earlier, we also understand that the Volcker rule has had an extraterritorial 

impact on FBOs.  With respect to foreign banks, there are at least a few places where we would 

like to revisit the application of the final rule based on concerns raised by market participants and 

others over the past four years of implementation.   

 In particular, there are certain foreign funds--funds that are organized outside the United 

States by foreign banks in foreign jurisdictions and offered solely to foreign investors--that are

subject to the Volcker rule due to Bank Holding Company Act control principles.  Last summer, 

the banking agencies, in consultation with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the 

Commodity Futures Trading Commission, issued guidance that effectively stayed enforcement 

of the Volcker rule to these foreign funds in light of the technical and complex issues they raise.8  

I expect we would continue this period of stay while we continue to consider these important 

issues.  

 The statute also contains exemptions for FBOs to allow foreign banks to continue trading 

and engaging in covered fund activities solely outside the United States.  The regulation again 

has a complex series of requirements that a foreign bank must meet to make use of these 

exemptions.  We have heard from a number of foreign banks that complying with these 

requirements is unworkable in practice, and we are considering ways to address this 

impracticality.  One possibility that has been suggested by market participants is a simple 

approach that focuses on the risk of the booking location.  Of course, we would have to consider 

whether this is possible in light of the language of the statute and principles of competitive 

equity, but the suggestion is illustrative of the possibility of a more workable approach.   

As a final but no less important matter, we are considering broad revisions to the Volcker 

rule compliance regime.  We would like Volcker rule compliance to be similar to compliance in 

other areas of our supervisory regime.  As I noted earlier, we appreciate the broad extraterritorial 

impact of the rule in its current form on foreign banks’ operations outside of the United States.

Comptroller of the Currency, “Statement regarding Treatment of Certain Foreign Funds under the Rules 
Implementing Section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act,” July 21, 2017 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/files/bcreg20170721a1.pdf.

Accordingly, we will be looking for ways to reduce the compliance burden of the Volcker rule 

for foreign banks with limited U.S. operations and small U.S. trading books.    

Conclusion 

As I have described previously, the Federal Reserve is actively reviewing post-crisis 

financial reforms in an effort to better understand which reforms are working well and which 

ones can be improved to reduce regulatory burden and improve the efficiency, transparency, and 

simplicity of the regulatory framework without compromising a safe and sound financial system.  

In that effort, we recognize the importance of foreign banks to the U.S. economy and have a 

strong interest in ensuring our regulations are appropriately tailored to their U.S. footprint and 

risks to U.S. financial stability.  Our goal is to maintain a regulatory framework that helps to 

ensure a strong and stable banking system in an efficient manner that does not result in 

excessively burdensome costs to the banking industry or the economy as a whole.  

The areas I have discussed today are important components of the exercise of improving 

our regulations as they apply to FBOs, and are part of a larger overall agenda to critically 

evaluate and improve our regulations to promote financial stability while fostering the conditions 

for solid economic activity.  Some of these exercises will require more effort and time than 

others, but each one of them is a high priority for us at the Federal Reserve.  I look forward to 

hearing your views as we make progress toward these improvements.
