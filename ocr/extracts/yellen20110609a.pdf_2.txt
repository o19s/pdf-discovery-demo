Good morning.  I very much appreciate your invitation to speak today.  The theme 

of this ninth annual Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Policy Summit, “Housing, 

Human Capital, and Inequality,” could not be timelier.  Almost no community in 

America has escaped the effects of the economic downturn, but many low- and moderate-

income communities were hit especially hard, including a large number in and around our 

host city of Cleveland.  As one sobering example, almost 10 percent of current Cleveland 

residents who have ever taken out a mortgage have a foreclosure reflected on their credit 

report--a rate double that of the rest of the nation.1 

 I will focus today on the state of the housing market and emphasize developments 

pertaining to low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  I will then discuss policy 

initiatives to address some of the challenges confronting the housing market.   

The State of the Housing Market 

 As you know, house prices are a critical element in understanding the state of the 

housing market.  Nationally, house prices have been falling for six years, and most 

industry analysts expect further declines before prices bottom out.  Households are 

equally pessimistic about the trajectory of house prices.  According to one prominent 

survey, only 15 percent of homeowners expect house prices to increase over the next 

year, and barely half expect house price increases over the next five years.2   

 Largely because of the fall in house prices and the sustained high rate of 

unemployment, about 4-1/2 percent of mortgages in the United States are currently in 

foreclosure, and three or more payments have been missed on an additional 3-1/2 percent.
