I would like to thank Michael Ash for his kind introduction and the University of 

Massachusetts for the honor of being invited to deliver this year’s Philip Gamble 

Memorial Lecture.  

In my remarks today, I will discuss inflation and its role in the Federal Reserve’s 

conduct of monetary policy.  I will begin by reviewing the history of inflation in the 

United States since the 1960s, highlighting two key points:  that inflation is now much 

more stable than it used to be, and that it is currently running at a very low level.  I will 

then consider the costs associated with inflation, and why these costs suggest that the 

Federal Reserve should try to keep inflation close to 2 percent.  After briefly reviewing 

our policy actions since the financial crisis, I will discuss the dynamics of inflation and 

their implications for the outlook and monetary policy.  

Historical Review of Inflation 

A crucial responsibility of any central bank is to control inflation, the average rate 

of increase in the prices of a broad group of goods and services.  Keeping inflation stable 

at a moderately low level is important because, for reasons I will discuss, inflation that is 

high, excessively low, or unstable imposes significant costs on households and 

businesses.  As a result, inflation control is one half of the dual mandate that Congress 

has laid down for the Federal Reserve, which is to pursue maximum employment and 

stable prices.   

The Federal Reserve has not always been successful in fulfilling the price stability 

element of its mandate.  The dashed red line in figure 1 plots the four-quarter percent 

change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)--the measure of 

inflation that the Fed’s policymaking body, the Federal Open Market Committee, or 


 - 2 - 

FOMC, uses to define its longer-run inflation goal.1  Starting in the mid-1960s, inflation 

began to move higher.  Large jumps in food and energy prices played a role in this 

upward move, but they were not the whole story, for, as illustrated here, inflation was 

already moving up before the food and energy shocks hit in the 1970s and the early 

1980s.2  And if we look at core inflation, the solid black line, which excludes food and 

energy prices, we see that it too starts to move higher in the mid-1960s and rises to very 

elevated levels during the 1970s, which strongly suggests that something more than the 

energy and food price shocks must have been at work. 

A second important feature of inflation over this period can be seen if we examine 

an estimate of its long-term trend, which is plotted as the dotted black line in figure 1.  At 

each point in time, this trend is defined as the prediction from a statistical model of the 

level to which inflation is projected to return in the long run once the effects of any 

shocks to the economy have fully played out.3  As can be seen from the figure, this 

estimated trend drifts higher over the 1960s and 1970s, implying that during this period

Strategy, available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_LongerRunGoals.pdf.   
2 The first jump in energy prices in the 1970s reflected a rise in crude oil prices whose proximate cause was 
the so-called Arab oil embargo that followed the 1973 Arab-Israeli War; the first jump in food prices was 
caused by disease and poor harvests combined with low levels of inventories (particularly for grains) in 
many countries.  The second energy price shock resulted from a jump in crude oil prices following the 
1978-79 revolution in Iran and subsequent Iraqi invasion; the second food price shock was largely 
attributable to bad weather and disease.  (See Blinder and Rudd, 2013, for an assessment of the effect that 
these and other special factors--including the imposition and removal of price controls over the 1971-74 
period--had on consumer price inflation in the 1970s and 1980s.)  
3 The predicted long-run trend shown here updates an estimate made by Peneva and Rudd (2015), which 
uses a vector autoregression (VAR) with time-varying parameters and stochastic volatility to compute a 
stochastic trend for inflation (see that paper for additional details regarding model specification and data 
definitions).  The estimation procedure for the VAR is similar to that used by Clark and Terry (2010), 
which in turn follows Cogley and Sargent (2005); see also Cogley and others (2010) and Ascari and 
Sbordone (2014) for related applications.

there was no stable “anchor” to which inflation could be expected to eventually return--a 

conclusion generally supported by other procedures for estimating trend inflation.   

Today many economists believe that these features of inflation in the late 1960s 

and 1970s--its high level and lack of a stable anchor--reflected a combination of factors, 

including chronically overheated labor and product markets, the effects of the energy and 

food price shocks, and the emergence of an “inflationary psychology” whereby a rise in 

actual inflation led people to revise up their expectations for future inflation.  Together, 

these various factors caused inflation--actual and expected--to ratchet higher over time.  

Ultimately, however, monetary policy bears responsibility for the broad contour of what 

happened to actual and expected inflation during this period because the Federal Reserve 

was insufficiently focused on returning inflation to a predictable, low level following the 

shocks to food and energy prices and other disturbances.  

In late 1979, the Federal Reserve began significantly tightening monetary policy 

to reduce inflation.  In response to this tightening, which precipitated a severe economic 

downturn in the early 1980s, overall inflation moved persistently lower, averaging less 

than 4 percent from 1983 to 1990.  Inflation came down further following the 1990-91 

recession and subsequent slow recovery and then averaged about 2 percent for many 

years.  Since the recession ended in 2009, however, the United States has experienced 

inflation running appreciably below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, in part reflecting 

the gradual pace of the subsequent economic recovery.  

Examining the behavior of inflation’s estimated long-term trend reveals another 

important change in inflation dynamics.  With the caveat that these results are based on a 

specific implementation of a particular statistical model, they imply that since the mid-


 - 4 - 

1990s there have been no persistent movements in this predicted long-run inflation rate, 

which has remained very close to 2 percent.  Remarkably, this stability is estimated to 

have continued during and after the recent severe recession, which saw the 

unemployment rate rise to levels comparable to those seen during the 1981-82 downturn, 

when the trend did shift down markedly.4  As I will discuss, the stability of this trend 

appears linked to a change in the behavior of long-run inflation expectations--measures of 

which appear to be much better anchored today than in the past, likely reflecting an 

improvement in the conduct of monetary policy.  In any event, this empirical analysis 

implies that, over the past 20 years, inflation has been much more predictable over the 

longer term than it was back in the 1970s because the trend rate to which inflation was 

predicted to return no longer moved around appreciably.  That said, inflation still varied 

considerably from year to year in response to various shocks. 

As figure 2 highlights, the United States has experienced very low inflation on 

average since the financial crisis, in part reflecting persistent economic weakness that has 

proven difficult to fully counter with monetary policy.  Overall inflation (shown as the 

dashed red line) has averaged only about 1-1/2 percent per year since 2008 and is 

currently close to zero.  This result is not merely a product of falling energy prices, as 

core inflation (the solid black line) has also been low on average over this period.   

Inflation Costs 

In 2012 the FOMC adopted, for the first time, an explicit longer-run inflation 

objective of 2 percent as measured by the PCE price index.5  (Other central banks, 

                                                 
4 Trend inflation estimates from univariate statistical models manifest somewhat less stability in recent 
years; see Clark and Bednar (2015).     
5 In contrast, the FOMC has determined that a number of considerations preclude it from setting a fixed 
numerical target for the other leg of its dual mandate, maximum employment.  As discussed in its 


 - 5 - 

including the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, also have a 2 percent 

inflation target.)  This decision reflected the FOMC’s judgment that inflation that 

persistently deviates--up or down--from a fixed low level can be costly in a number of 

ways.  Persistent high inflation induces households and firms to spend time and effort 

trying to minimize their cash holdings and forces businesses to adjust prices more 

frequently than would otherwise be necessary.  More importantly, high inflation also 

tends to raise the after-tax cost of capital, thereby discouraging business investment.  

These adverse effects occur because capital depreciation allowances and other aspects of 

our tax system are only partially indexed for inflation.6 

Persistently high inflation, if unanticipated, can be especially costly for 

households that rely on pensions, annuities, and long-term bonds to provide a significant 

portion of their retirement income.  Because the income provided by these assets is 

typically fixed in nominal terms, its real purchasing power may decline surprisingly 

quickly if inflation turns out to be consistently higher than originally anticipated, with 

potentially serious consequences for retirees’ standard of living as they age.7  

                                                 
Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (see note 1), the maximum level of 
employment is something that is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and 
dynamics of the labor market.  Moreover, the maximum level of employment, the longer-run “natural” rate 
of unemployment, and other related aspects of the labor market are not directly observable, can change 
over time, and can only be estimated imprecisely.  As a result, views vary about what labor market 
conditions would be consistent with a normal level of resource utilization.   
6 For a general survey of the costs of high inflation, see Briault (1995).  English (1999) discusses costs 
associated with an increased need for cash management.  For a discussion of costs that arise through 
interactions of inflation with the tax system, see Feldstein (1997, 1999) and Cohen and others (1999).  
Finally, high inflation may adversely affect the economy’s allocation of resources by increasing the 
magnitude of misalignments in relative prices that result because firms do not continually adjust all of their 
prices; for a discussion of such costs in the context of the new-Keynesian model of inflation, see Ascari and 
Sbordone (2014).   
7 More broadly, if inflation evolves in an unpredictable manner over many years, then even financially 
sophisticated households and firms may not be able to avoid significant forecasting errors with their 
attendant costs.  Such costs can arise in a wide variety of situations; for instance, any firm, union, or other 
entity that engages in a multiyear nominal contract may be adversely affected by unexpected increases or 
decreases in inflation, although those on the other side of the contract might benefit. 


 - 6 - 

An unexpected rise in inflation also tends to reduce the real purchasing power of 

labor income for a time because nominal wages and salaries are generally slow to adjust 

to movements in the overall level of prices.  Survey data suggest that this effect is 

probably the number one reason why people dislike inflation so much.8  In the longer run, 

however, real wages--that is, wages adjusted for inflation--appear to be largely 

independent of the average rate of inflation and instead are primarily determined by 

productivity, global competition, and other nonmonetary factors.  In support of this view, 

figure 3 shows that nominal wage growth tends to broadly track price inflation over long 

periods of time.   

Inflation that is persistently very low can also be costly, and it is such costs that 

have been particularly relevant to monetary policymakers in recent years.  The most 

important cost is that very low inflation constrains a central bank’s ability to combat 

recessions.  Normally, the FOMC fights economic downturns by reducing the nominal 

federal funds rate, the rate charged by banks to lend to each other overnight.  These 

reductions, current and expected, stimulate spending and hiring by lowering longer-term 

real interest rates--that is, nominal rates adjusted for inflation--and improving financial 

conditions more broadly.  But the federal funds rate and other nominal interest rates 

cannot go much below zero, since holding cash is always an alternative to investing in 

securities.9  Thus, the lowest the FOMC can feasibly push the real federal funds rate is 

essentially the negative value of the inflation rate.  As a result, the Federal Reserve has 

                                                 
8 For more on this survey, see Shiller (1997). 
9 Because of the inconvenience of storing and protecting very large quantities of currency, some firms are 
willing to pay a premium to hold short-term government securities or bank deposits instead.  As a result, 
several foreign central banks have found it possible to push nominal short-term interest rates somewhat 
below zero.

less room to ease monetary policy when inflation is very low.  This limitation is a 

potentially serious problem because severe downturns such as the Great Recession may 

require pushing real interest rates far below zero for an extended period to restore full 

employment at a satisfactory pace.10  For this reason, pursuing too low an inflation 

objective or otherwise tolerating persistently very low inflation would be inconsistent 

with the other leg of the FOMC’s mandate, to promote maximum employment.11 

An unexpected decline in inflation that is sizable and persistent can also be costly 

because it increases the debt burdens of borrowers.  Consider homeowners who take out a 

conventional fixed-rate mortgage, with the expectation that inflation will remain close to 

2 percent and their nominal incomes will rise about 4 percent per year.  If the economy 

were instead to experience chronic mild deflation accompanied by flat or declining 

nominal incomes, then after a few years the homeowners might find it noticeably more 

difficult to cover their monthly mortgage payments than they had originally anticipated.  

Moreover, if house prices fall in line with consumer prices rather than rising as expected, 

then the equity in their home will be lower than they had anticipated.  This situation, 

which is sometimes referred to as “debt deflation,” would also confront all households 

with outstanding student loans, auto loans, or credit card debt, as well as businesses that 

                                                 
10 For example, Curdia and others (2014) estimate that stabilizing the economy during the last recession 
would have required lowering the real federal funds rate to negative 10 percent for a time; by comparison, 
the average value of the real federal funds has been only negative 1-1/4 percent since early 2009.  Of 
course, the FOMC was able to use other policy tools, such as large-scale asset purchases, to put additional 
downward pressure on long-term interest rates after the nominal funds rate was cut to near zero; however, 
those policies had potential costs and risks that made them an imperfect substitute for traditional interest 
rate policy.  See Krugman (1998), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Eggertsson and Woodford 
(2003) for discussions of the effects that low inflation and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates 
have on a central bank’s ability to stimulate the economy during economic downturns.  In addition, see 
English, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015) and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) for model-based 
analyses of the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance in 
mitigating the effects of the zero lower bound.  Finally, for a discussion of the costs and benefits of 
employing large scale asset purchases, see Bernanke (2012) and Yellen (2013).

had taken out bank loans or issued bonds.12  Of course, in this situation, lenders would be 

receiving more real income.  But the net effect on the economy is likely to be negative, in 

large part because borrowers typically have only a limited ability to absorb losses.  And if 

the increased debt-service burdens and declines in collateral values are severe enough to 

force borrowers into bankruptcy, then the resultant hardship imposed on families, small 

business owners, and laid-off workers may be very severe.13   

Monetary Policy Actions since the Financial Crisis 

As I noted earlier, after weighing the costs associated with various rates of 

inflation, the FOMC decided that 2 percent inflation is an appropriate operational 

definition of its longer-run price objective.14  In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, 

                                                 
12 See Fisher (1933) for an early discussion of debt deflation and its effects on the economy. 
13 Very low inflation also can result in chronically higher unemployment by closing off an important way in 
which the labor market can respond to adverse shocks.  In sectors where productivity is lagging or demand 
is slowing, declines in real wages might be necessary to avoid even worse outcomes, such as layoffs.  For 
various reasons, however, employers often try to avoid nominal wage cuts.  (Bewley (1999) suggests a 
number of reasons that firms find cutting nominal wages difficult, including the effect that such cuts have 
on employee morale.  Inflation is therefore often said to “grease the wheels of the labor market” because it 
permits these required adjustments in real wages to occur through a combination of unchanged nominal 
wages and rising prices.)  But when inflation falls to a very low level, this passive approach to wage 
reductions may no longer be viable for many firms, causing relatively more of the burden of adjustment to 
fall on employment. 
14 Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), among others, have recently suggested that central banks 
should consider raising their inflation targets, on the grounds that conditions since the financial crisis have 
demonstrated that monetary policy is more constrained by the effective lower bound (ELB) on nominal 
interest rates than was originally estimated.  Ball (2013), for example, has proposed 4 percent as a more 
appropriate target for the FOMC.  While it is certainly true that earlier analyses of ELB costs significantly 
underestimated the likelihood of severe recessions and slow recoveries of the sort recently experienced in 
the United States and elsewhere (see Chung and others, 2012), it is also the case that these analyses did not 
take into account central banks’ ability to use large-scale asset purchases and other unconventional tools to 
mitigate the costs arising from the ELB constraint.  In addition, it is not obvious that a modestly higher 
target rate of inflation would have greatly increased the Federal Reserve’s ability to support real activity in 
the special conditions that prevailed in the wake of the financial crisis, when some of the channels through 
which lower interest rates stimulate aggregate spending, such as housing construction, were probably 
attenuated.  Beyond these tactical considerations, however, changing the FOMC’s long-run inflation 
objective would risk calling into question the FOMC’s commitment to stabilizing inflation at any level 
because it might lead people to suspect that the target could be changed opportunistically in the future.  If 
so, then the key benefits of stable inflation expectations discussed below--an increased ability of monetary 
policy to fight economic downturns without sacrificing price stability--might be lost.  Moreover, if the 
purpose of a higher inflation target is to increase the ability of central banks to deal with the severe 
recessions that follow financial crises, then a better strategic approach might be to rely on more vigorous 
supervisory and macroprudential policies to reduce the likelihood of such events.  Finally, targeting

however, achieving both this objective and full employment (the other leg of the Federal 

Reserve’s dual mandate) has been difficult, as shown in figure 4.  Initially, the 

unemployment rate (the solid black line) soared and inflation (the dashed red line) fell 

sharply.  Moreover, after the recession officially ended in 2009, the subsequent recovery 

was significantly slowed by a variety of persistent headwinds, including households with 

underwater mortgages and high debt burdens, reduced access to credit for many potential 

borrowers, constrained spending by state and local governments, and weakened foreign 

growth prospects.  In an effort to return employment and inflation to levels consistent 

with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate, the FOMC took a variety of unprecedented 

actions to help lower longer-term interest rates, including reducing the federal funds rate 

(the dotted black line) to near zero, communicating to the public that short-term interest 

rates would likely stay exceptionally low for some time, and buying large quantities of 

longer-term Treasury debt and agency-issued mortgage-backed securities.15   

These actions contributed to highly accommodative financial conditions, thereby 

helping to bring about a considerable improvement in labor market conditions over time.  

The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in 2009, is now 5.1 percent, slightly 

above the median of FOMC participants’ current estimates of its longer-run normal level.  

Although other indicators suggest that the unemployment rate currently understates how 

much slack remains in the labor market, on balance the economy is no longer far away 

                                                 
inflation in the vicinity of 4 percent or higher would stretch the meaning of “stable prices” in the Federal 
Reserve Act.

Reifschneider (2015) for an analysis of the combined macroeconomic effects of the FOMC’s asset 
purchases and guidance concerning the future path of the federal funds rate.

from full employment.  In contrast, inflation has continued to run below the Committee’s 

objective over the past several years, and over the past 12 months it has been essentially 

zero.  Nevertheless, the Committee expects that inflation will gradually return to 

2 percent over the next two or three years.  I will now turn to the determinants of inflation 

and the factors that underlie this expectation.   

Inflation Dynamics 

Models used to describe and predict inflation commonly distinguish between 

changes in food and energy prices--which enter into total inflation--and movements in the 

prices of other goods and services--that is, core inflation.  This decomposition is useful 

because food and energy prices can be extremely volatile, with fluctuations that often 

depend on factors that are beyond the influence of monetary policy, such as technological 

or political developments (in the case of energy prices) or weather or disease (in the case 

of food prices).  As a result, core inflation usually provides a better indicator than total 

inflation of where total inflation is headed in the medium term.16  Of course, food and 

energy account for a significant portion of household budgets, so the Federal Reserve’s 

inflation objective is defined in terms of the overall change in consumer prices.   

What, then, determines core inflation?  Recalling figure 1, core inflation tends to 

fluctuate around a longer-term trend that now is essentially stable.  Let me first focus on 

these fluctuations before turning to the trend.  Economic theory suggests, and empirical 

analysis confirms, that such deviations of inflation from trend depend partly on the 

                                                 
16 Several other approaches are commonly used to abstract from the short-term volatility of overall inflation 
and thereby better discern its medium-term direction.  For example, one procedure removes the 
components of the total PCE price index with the largest or smallest price changes before computing the 
average price change, yielding the “trimmed mean” PCE index; another uses the median price change in a 
given period, rather than the mean change, to represent the overall inflation rate.  In practice, simply using 
core inflation does about as well in predicting overall inflation over the coming year and beyond as these 
alternative procedures (see Detmeister, 2011, 2012). 


 - 11 - 

intensity of resource utilization in the economy--as approximated, for example, by the 

gap between the actual unemployment rate and its so-called natural rate, or by the 

shortfall of actual gross domestic product (GDP) from potential output.  This 

relationship--which likely reflects, among other things, a tendency for firms’ costs to rise 

as utilization rates increase--represents an important channel through which monetary 

policy influences inflation over the medium term, although in practice the influence is 

modest and gradual.  Movements in certain types of input costs, particularly changes in 

the price of imported goods, also can cause core inflation to deviate noticeably from its 

trend, sometimes by a marked amount from year to year.17  Finally, a nontrivial fraction 

of the quarter-to-quarter, and even the year-to-year, variability of inflation is attributable 

to idiosyncratic and often unpredictable shocks.18   

What about the determinants of inflation’s longer-term trend?  Here, it is 

instructive to compare the purely statistical estimate of the trend rate of future inflation 

shown earlier in figure 1 with survey measures of people’s actual expectations of long-

run inflation, as is done in figure 5.  Theory suggests that inflation expectations--which 

presumably are linked to the central bank’s inflation goal--should play an important role 

in actual price setting.19  Indeed, the contours of these series are strikingly similar, which 

                                                 
17 Another input cost that can affect core inflation is the price of energy; in recent decades, however, the 
pass-through of energy price changes to core inflation appears much smaller than in previous periods (see 
Hooker, 2002; Clark and Terry, 2010). 
18 Some of these idiosyncratic shocks are related to identifiable factors, such as changes in Medicare 
reimbursement rates or movements in the (imputed) price of holding a checking account.  (Both of these 
factors are included in the services component of the PCE price index, but not the consumer price index 
(CPI).)  However, not all idiosyncratic shocks can be reliably traced to specific factors, as a significant 
fraction represents unpredictable “noise.” 
19 Most theoretical versions of the Phillips curve suggest that inflation should depend on short-run inflation 
expectations, but, as an empirical matter, measures of long-run expectations appear to explain the data 
better.

suggests that the estimated trend in inflation is in fact related to households’ and firms’ 

long-run inflation expectations.20  

To summarize, this analysis suggests that economic slack, changes in imported 

goods prices, and idiosyncratic shocks all cause core inflation to deviate from a longer-

term trend that is ultimately determined by long-run inflation expectations.  As some will 

recognize, this model of core inflation is a variant of a theoretical model that is 

commonly referred to as an expectations-augmented Phillips curve.21  Total inflation in 

turn reflects movements in core inflation, combined with changes in the prices of food 

and energy.   

An important feature of this model of inflation dynamics is that the overall effect 

that variations in resource utilization, import prices, and other factors will have on 

inflation depends crucially on whether these influences also affect long-run inflation 

expectations.  Figure 6 illustrates this point with a stylized example of the inflation 

consequences of a gradual increase in the level of import prices--perhaps occurring in 

response to stronger real activity abroad or a fall in the exchange value of the dollar--that 

causes the rate of change of import prices to be elevated for a time.22  First, consider the 

                                                 
20 See Clark and Davig (2008); see also Faust and Wright (2013), who make a related point in the context 
of inflation forecasting.  Note that the question about expected inflation in the University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers is not phrased in terms of a specific measure of prices, so its level--as opposed to its 
contour--cannot be directly compared with a particular measure of inflation such as the change in the PCE 
price index.   
21 See Tobin (1972) and Friedman (1968) for early discussions of the theory underpinning the expectations-
augmented Phillips curve.  Theoretical descriptions of the inflation process remain an active area of 
research in economics.  In recent years, many economic theorists have used a so-called new-Keynesian 
framework--in which optimizing agents are assumed to face constraints on price or wage setting in the form 
of adjustment costs or explicit nominal contracts--to model inflation dynamics (see Woodford, 2003, 
chapter 3, for a textbook treatment).  Although these new-Keynesian inflation models can differ 
importantly in their specifics, they all tend to assign a central role to inflation expectations and resource 
utilization as drivers of inflation dynamics. 
22 In this exercise, we ignore any inflation effects that might arise because of shifts in resource utilization 
induced by the change in import prices, which are expressed relative to core prices.  


 - 13 - 

situation shown in panel A, in which households’ and firms’ expectations of inflation are 

not solidly anchored, but instead adjust in response to the rates of inflation that are 

actually observed.23  Such conditions--which arguably prevailed in the United States from 

the 1970s to the mid-1990s--could plausibly arise if the central bank has, in the past, 

allowed significant and persistent movements in inflation to occur.  In this case, the 

temporary rise in the rate of change of import prices results in a permanent increase in 

inflation.  This shift occurs because the initial increase in inflation generated by a period 

of rising import prices leads households and firms to revise up their expectations of future 

inflation.  A permanent rise in inflation would also result from a sustained rise in the 

level of oil prices or a temporary increase in resource utilization.     

By contrast, suppose that inflation expectations are instead well anchored, perhaps 

because the central bank has been successful over time in keeping inflation near some 

specified target and has made it clear to the public that it intends to continue to do so.  

Then the response of inflation to a temporary increase in the rate of change of import 

prices or any other transitory shock will resemble the pattern shown in panel B.  In this 

case, inflation will deviate from its longer-term level only as long as import prices are 

rising.  But once they level out, inflation will fall back to its previous trend in the absence 

of other disturbances.24   

A key implication of these two examples is that the presence of well-anchored 

inflation expectations greatly enhances a central bank’s ability to pursue both of its 

                                                 
23 An expectations-augmented Phillips curve in which expectations of inflation are assumed to eventually 
respond one-for-one to actual past inflation is typically referred to as an accelerationist Phillips curve. 
24 Qualitatively similar results obtain in fully specified structural models with rational expectations--
including the FRB/US, EDO, and SIGMA models maintained at the Federal Reserve Board--in which the 
long-term behavior of inflation and inflation expectations is governed by the central bank’s (fixed) inflation 
objective.

objectives--namely, price stability and full employment.  Because temporary shifts in the 

rate of change of import prices or other transitory shocks have no permanent influence on 

expectations, they have only a transitory effect on inflation.  As a result, the central bank 

can “look through” such short-run inflationary disturbances in setting monetary policy, 

allowing it to focus on returning the economy to full employment without placing price 

stability at risk.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve has done just that in setting monetary policy 

over the past decade or more.  Moreover, as I will discuss shortly, these inflation 

dynamics are a key reason why the FOMC expects inflation to return to 2 percent over 

the next few years.   

On balance, the evidence suggests that inflation expectations are in fact well 

anchored at present.  Figure 7 plots the two survey measures of longer-term expected 

inflation I presented earlier, along with a measure of longer-term inflation compensation 

derived as the difference between yields on nominal Treasury securities and inflation-

indexed ones, called TIPS.  Since the late 1990s, survey measures of longer-term 

inflation expectations have been quite stable; this stability has persisted in recent years 

despite a deep recession and concerns expressed by some observers regarding the 

potential inflationary effects of unconventional monetary policy.  The fact that these 

survey measures appear to have remained anchored at about the same levels that 

prevailed prior to the recession suggests that, once the economy has returned to full 

employment (and absent any other shocks), core inflation should return to its 

pre-recession average level of about 2 percent. 

This conclusion is tempered somewhat by recent movements in longer-run 

inflation compensation, which in principle could reflect changes in investors’ 


 - 15 - 

expectations for long-run inflation.  This measure is now noticeably lower than in the 

years just prior to the financial crisis.25  However, movements in inflation compensation 

are difficult to interpret because they can be driven by factors that are unique to financial 

markets--such as movements in liquidity or risk premiums--as well as by changes in 

expected inflation.26  Indeed, empirical work that attempts to control for these factors 

suggests that the long-run inflation expectations embedded in asset prices have in fact 

moved down relatively little over the past decade.27  Nevertheless, the decline in inflation 

compensation over the past year may indicate that financial market participants now see 

an increased risk of very low inflation persisting.  

Although the evidence, on balance, suggests that inflation expectations are well 

anchored at present, policymakers would be unwise to take this situation for granted.  

Anchored inflation expectations were not won easily or quickly:  Experience suggests 

that it takes many years of carefully conducted monetary policy to alter what households 

and firms perceive to be inflation’s “normal” behavior, and, furthermore, that a persistent 

failure to keep inflation under control--by letting it drift either too high or too low for too 

                                                 
25 In evaluating the potential implications of this decline for expected PCE inflation, one also needs to keep 
in mind that TIPS are indexed to the CPI.  CPI inflation generally runs a few tenths of a percentage point 
higher than PCE inflation, though that differential can vary materially over time.  
26 Another complication is that we do not know whose expectations “matter” for determining inflation.  
Inflation expectations of professional forecasters (such as those collected in the Blue Chip Economic 
Indicators, the Survey of Professional Forecasters, or the Survey of Primary Dealers) or inflation 
expectations derived from asset prices probably capture the views of participants in financial markets but 
need not reflect the views of households and firms more broadly.  As an empirical matter, the little 
information available on the longer-term inflation expectations of firms from the Atlanta Federal Reserve 
Business Inflation Expectations survey suggests that firms’ expectations more closely resemble 
expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers than the expectations of professional 
forecasters.  Similarly, preliminary data from a New Zealand study suggests that inflation forecasts of firms 
are much more similar to those of households than those of professional forecasters (see Coibion and 
Gorodnichenko, 2015). 
27 D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014) examine a number of models that use TIPS yields to back out expected 
inflation estimates.  The best-fitting models show only a small decline in longer-term inflation expectations 
since 2005. 


 - 16 - 

long--could cause expectations to once again become unmoored.28  Given that inflation 

has been running below the FOMC’s objective for several years now, such concerns 

reinforce the appropriateness of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy, which 

remains highly accommodative by historical standards and is directed toward helping 

return inflation to 2 percent over the medium term.29 

Before turning to the implications of this inflation model for the current outlook 

and monetary policy, a cautionary note is in order.  The Phillips-curve approach to 

forecasting inflation has a long history in economics, and it has usefully informed 

monetary policy decisionmaking around the globe.  But the theoretical underpinnings of 

the model are still a subject of controversy among economists.  Moreover, inflation 

sometimes moves in ways that empirical versions of the model, which necessarily are a 

                                                 
28 My interpretation of the historical evidence is that long-run inflation expectations become anchored at a 
particular level only after a central bank succeeds in keeping actual inflation near some target level for 
many years.  For that reason, I am somewhat skeptical about the actual effectiveness of any monetary 
policy that relies primarily on the central bank’s theoretical ability to influence the public’s inflation 
expectations directly by simply announcing that it will pursue a different inflation goal in the future.  
Although such announcements might potentially persuade some financial market participants and 
professional forecasters to shift their expectations, other members of the public are probably much less 
likely to do so.  Hence, actual inflation would probably be affected only after the central bank has had 
sufficient time to concretely demonstrate its sustained commitment and ability to generate a new norm for 
the average level of inflation and the behavior of monetary policy--a process that might take years, based 
on U.S. experience.  Consistent with my assessment that announcements alone are not enough, Bernanke 
and others (1999) found no evidence across a number of countries that the initial disinflation which follows 
the adoption of inflation targeting is any less costly than disinflations carried out under alternative 
monetary regimes. 
29 Some might be surprised that the preceding discussion of inflation determinants makes no mention of 
labor costs.  In the past, wages provided a good empirical indicator of the future direction of price inflation; 
indeed, the presence of a so-called wage-price spiral--in which higher price inflation led workers to push 
for higher wage growth, thereby in turn leading to even faster price increases as firms’ labor costs 
accelerated--was often invoked to explain the inflationary dynamics of the 1970s.  The wage-price spiral no 
longer seems to provide a useful description of the U.S. inflation process.  In fact, some evidence suggests 
that, like inflation, the rate of growth of labor costs is now characterized by a stable long-run trend; again, a 
likely explanation for this empirical finding is the improved anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.  
(See Peneva and Rudd, 2015, for some suggestive evidence along these lines.)  More generally, movements 
in labor costs no longer appear to be an especially good guide to future price movements.  (This 
development does not imply that wage developments carry no useful information:  Because wage growth is 
influenced by labor market slack, observed movements in compensation gains can provide an indication of 
how close the economy is to full employment.)

simplified version of a complicated reality, cannot adequately explain.  For this reason, 

significant uncertainty attaches to Phillips curve predictions, and the validity of forecasts 

from this model must be continuously evaluated in response to incoming data. 

Policy Implications 

Assuming that my reading of the data is correct and long-run inflation 

expectations are in fact anchored near their pre-recession levels, what implications does 

the preceding description of inflation dynamics have for the inflation outlook and for 

monetary policy?   

This framework suggests, first, that much of the recent shortfall of inflation from 

our 2 percent objective is attributable to special factors whose effects are likely to prove 

transitory.  As the solid black line in figure 8 indicates, PCE inflation has run noticeably 

below our 2 percent objective on average since 2008, with the shortfall approaching 

about 1 percentage point in both 2013 and 2014 and more than 1-1/2 percentage points 

this year.  The stacked bars in the figure give the contributions of various factors to these 

deviations from 2 percent, computed using an estimated version of the simple inflation 

model I just discussed.30  As the solid blue portion of the bars shows, falling consumer 

energy prices explain about half of this year’s shortfall and a sizable portion of the 2013 

and 2014 shortfalls as well.  Another important source of downward pressure this year 

has been a decline in import prices, the portion with orange checkerboard pattern, which 

                                                 
30 For a technical explanation of the procedure used to produce this decomposition, see the appendix.  In the 
decomposition procedure, movements in core inflation affect headline inflation one-for-one; as a result, the 
contributions of food and energy price inflation are defined as each component’s price change relative to 
the core, weighted by its share in total nominal consumer spending.  (Note that the “other” category 
includes the effects of changes in food prices.)  The estimated contribution of movements in import prices 
is also computed relative to core inflation; thus, if import prices are rising at the same rate as core inflation, 
they have no estimated effect on the shortfall of overall inflation from 2 percent.  In addition, the 
decomposition takes account of lags in the adjustment of core inflation to movements in resource utilization 
and other factors.

is largely attributable to the 15 percent appreciation in the dollar’s exchange value over 

the past year.  In contrast, the restraint imposed by economic slack, the green dotted 

portion, has diminished steadily over time as the economy has recovered and is now 

estimated to be relatively modest.31  Finally, a similarly small portion of the current 

shortfall of inflation from 2 percent is explained by other factors (which include changes 

in food prices); importantly, the effects of these other factors are transitory and often 

switch sign from year to year. 

Although an accounting exercise like this one is always imprecise and will depend 

on the specific model that is used, I think its basic message--that the current near-zero 

rate of inflation can mostly be attributed to the temporary effects of falling prices for 

energy and non-energy imports--is quite plausible.  If so, the 12-month change in total 

PCE prices is likely to rebound to 1-1/2 percent or higher in 2016, barring a further 

substantial drop in crude oil prices and provided that the dollar does not appreciate 

noticeably further.   

To be reasonably confident that inflation will return to 2 percent over the next few 

years, we need, in turn, to be reasonably confident that we will see continued solid 

economic growth and further gains in resource utilization, with longer-term inflation 

expectations remaining near their pre-recession level.  Fortunately, prospects for the U.S. 

economy generally appear solid.  Monthly payroll gains have averaged close to 210,000 

since the start of the year and the overall economy has been expanding modestly faster 

                                                 
31 As discussed later, the current difference between the unemployment rate and its normal longer-run level 
likely understates the actual amount of slack that remains in the labor market.  If so, the estimates reported 
in figure 8 somewhat understate the contribution of slack to the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent 
and, correspondingly, overstate the contribution from other factors.  For example, if the standard 
unemployment gap currently understates the true level of slack by 1/2 percentage point, then the 
contribution of slack to this year’s inflation shortfall is roughly 0.1 percentage point larger than the estimate 
reported in figure 8.   


 - 19 - 

than its productive potential.  My colleagues and I, based on our most recent forecasts, 

anticipate that this pattern will continue and that labor market conditions will improve 

further as we head into 2016.   

The labor market has achieved considerable progress over the past several years.  

Even so, further improvement in labor market conditions would be welcome because we 

are probably not yet all the way back to full employment.  Although the unemployment 

rate may now be close to its longer-run normal level--which most FOMC participants 

now estimate is around 4.9 percent--this traditional metric of resource utilization almost 

certainly understates the actual amount of slack that currently exists:  On a cyclically 

adjusted basis, the labor force participation rate remains low relative to its underlying 

trend, and an unusually large number of people are working part time but would prefer 

full-time employment.32  Consistent with this assessment is the slow pace at which hourly 

wages and compensation have been rising, which suggests that most firms still find it 

relatively easy to hire and retain employees.   

Reducing slack along these other dimensions may involve a temporary decline in 

the unemployment rate somewhat below the level that is estimated to be consistent, in the 

longer run, with inflation stabilizing at 2 percent.  For example, attracting discouraged 

workers back into the labor force may require a period of especially plentiful 

employment opportunities and strong hiring.  Similarly, firms may be unwilling to 

restructure their operations to use more full-time workers until they encounter greater 

difficulty filling part-time positions.  Beyond these considerations, a modest decline in 

                                                 
32 For a further discussion of the current level of resource utilization, see the Federal Reserve Board’s most 
recent Monetary Policy Report, dated July 15, 2015, available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm.

the unemployment rate below its long-run level for a time would, by increasing resource 

utilization, also have the benefit of speeding the return to 2 percent inflation.  Finally, 

albeit more speculatively, such an environment might help reverse some of the significant 

supply-side damage that appears to have occurred in recent years, thereby improving 

Americans’ standard of living. 33  

Consistent with the inflation framework I have outlined, the medians of the 

projections provided by FOMC participants at our recent meeting show inflation 

gradually moving back to 2 percent, accompanied by a temporary decline in 

unemployment slightly below the median estimate of the rate expected to prevail in the 

longer run.  These projections embody two key judgments regarding the projected 

relationship between real activity and interest rates.  First, the real federal funds rate is 

currently somewhat below the level that would be consistent with real GDP expanding in 

line with potential, which implies that the unemployment rate is likely to continue to fall 

in the absence of some tightening.  Second, participants implicitly expect that the various 

headwinds to economic growth that I mentioned earlier will continue to fade, thereby 

boosting the economy’s underlying strength.  Combined, these two judgments imply that 

the real interest rate consistent with achieving and then maintaining full employment in 

the medium run should rise gradually over time.  This expectation, coupled with inherent 

lags in the response of real activity and inflation to changes in monetary policy, are the 

key reasons that most of my colleagues and I anticipate that it will likely be appropriate 

to raise the target range for the federal funds rate sometime later this year and to continue 

                                                 
33 For a discussion of the supply-side damage that has occurred since 2007 and the potential benefits of 
partially reversing it through more accommodative monetary policy, see Reifschneider, Wascher, and 
Wilcox (2015) and Van Zandweghe (forthcoming).  


 - 21 - 

boosting short-term rates at a gradual pace thereafter as the labor market improves further 

and inflation moves back to our 2 percent objective.   

By itself, the precise timing of the first increase in our target for the federal funds 

rate should have only minor implications for financial conditions and the general 

economy.  What matters for overall financial conditions is the entire trajectory of short-

term interest rates that is anticipated by markets and the public.  As I noted, most of my 

colleagues and I anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant raising short-

term interest rates at a quite gradual pace over the next few years.  It’s important to 

emphasize, however, that both the timing of the first rate increase and any subsequent 

adjustments to our federal funds rate target will depend on how developments in the 

economy influence the Committee’s outlook for progress toward maximum employment 

and 2 percent inflation.   

The economic outlook, of course, is highly uncertain and it is conceivable, for 

example, that inflation could remain appreciably below our 2 percent target despite the 

apparent anchoring of inflation expectations.  Here, Japan’s recent history may be 

instructive:  As shown in figure 9, survey measures of longer-term expected inflation in 

that country remained positive and stable even as that country experienced many years of 

persistent, mild deflation.34  The explanation for the persistent divergence between actual 

and expected inflation in Japan is not clear, but I believe that it illustrates a problem faced 

by all central banks:  Economists’ understanding of the dynamics of inflation is far from 

perfect.  Reflecting that limited understanding, the predictions of our models often err, 

                                                 
34 In addition, we cannot count on expectations remaining anchored if the Federal Reserve were to permit 
actual inflation to continue to run noticeably below its announced objective after the real economy has 
substantially recovered. 


 - 22 - 

sometimes significantly so.  Accordingly, inflation may rise more slowly or rapidly than 

the Committee currently anticipates; should such a development occur, we would need to 

adjust the stance of policy in response.   

Considerable uncertainties also surround the outlook for economic activity.   For 

example, we cannot be certain about the pace at which the headwinds still restraining the 

domestic economy will continue to fade.  Moreover, net exports have served as a 

significant drag on growth over the past year and recent global economic and financial 

developments highlight the risk that a slowdown in foreign growth might restrain U.S. 

economic activity somewhat further.  The Committee is monitoring developments 

abroad, but we do not currently anticipate that the effects of these recent developments on 

the U.S. economy will prove to be large enough to have a significant effect on the path 

for policy.  That said, in response to surprises affecting the outlook for economic activity, 

as with those affecting inflation, the FOMC would need to adjust the stance of policy so 

that our actions remain consistent with inflation returning to our 2 percent objective over 

the medium term in the context of maximum employment.   

Given the highly uncertain nature of the outlook, one might ask:  Why not hold 

off raising the federal funds rate until the economy has reached full employment and 

inflation is actually back at 2 percent?  The difficulty with this strategy is that monetary 

policy affects real activity and inflation with a substantial lag.  If the FOMC were to 

delay the start of the policy normalization process for too long, we would likely end up 

having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the economy from significantly 

overshooting both of our goals.  Such an abrupt tightening would risk disrupting financial 

markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy into recession.  In addition, 


 - 23 - 

continuing to hold short-term interest rates near zero well after real activity has returned 

to normal and headwinds have faded could encourage excessive leverage and other forms 

of inappropriate risk-taking that might undermine financial stability.  For these reasons, 

the more prudent strategy is to begin tightening in a timely fashion and at a gradual pace, 

adjusting policy as needed in light of incoming data.  

Conclusion 

To conclude, let me emphasize that, following the dual mandate established by 

the Congress, the Federal Reserve is committed to the achievement of maximum 

employment and price stability.  To this end, we have maintained a highly 

accommodative monetary policy since the financial crisis; that policy has fostered a 

marked improvement in labor market conditions and helped check undesirable 

disinflationary pressures.  However, we have not yet fully attained our objectives under 

the dual mandate:  Some slack remains in labor markets, and the effects of this slack and 

the influence of lower energy prices and past dollar appreciation have been significant 

factors keeping inflation below our goal.  But I expect that inflation will return to 

2 percent over the next few years as the temporary factors that are currently weighing on 

inflation wane, provided that economic growth continues to be strong enough to complete 

the return to maximum employment and long-run inflation expectations remain well 

anchored.  Most FOMC participants, including myself, currently anticipate that achieving 

these conditions will likely entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate later this 

year, followed by a gradual pace of tightening thereafter.  But if the economy surprises 

us, our judgments about appropriate monetary policy will change.

Appendix:  The Estimated Inflation Model and Inflation Decomposition Procedure 

The inflation model used in the decomposition procedure includes two equations--

an identity for the change in the price index for total personal consumption expenditures 

(PCE) and a simple reduced-form forecasting equation for core PCE inflation.35  The 

identity is 

𝜋𝑡 =  𝜋𝑡
𝑐 + 𝜔𝑡

𝑒𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐸𝑡 + 𝜔𝑡
𝑓

𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐹𝑡,  

where 𝜋𝑡 and 𝜋𝑡
𝑐 denote growth rates (expressed as annualized log differences) of total 

and core PCE prices, respectively; 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐸𝑡 and 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝐹𝑡 are annualized growth rates for 

prices of consumer energy goods and services and prices of food and beverages, both 

expressed relative to core PCE prices; and  𝜔𝑡
𝑒 and  𝜔𝑡

𝑓
 are the weights of energy and 

food in total consumption.  The core inflation forecasting equation is 

𝜋𝑡
𝑐 = .41𝜋𝑡

𝑒 + .36𝜋𝑡−1
𝑐 + .23𝜋𝑡−2

𝑐 − .08𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 + .57𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 + 𝜖𝑡,  

where 𝜋𝑡
𝑒  is expected long-run inflation; 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 denotes the level of resource utilization; 

𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 controls for the effect of changes in the relative price of core imported goods; 𝜖𝑡 

is a white-noise error term; and the coefficients are ordinary least squares estimates 

obtained using data from 1990:Q1 to 2014:Q4. 

For estimation purposes, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 is approximated using the unemployment rate 

less the Congressional Budget Office’s (CBO) historical series for the long-run natural 

rate, while 𝜋𝑡
𝑒  is proxied using the median forecasts of long-run PCE or CPI inflation 

reported in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, with a constant adjustment of 40 basis 

                                                 
35 This appendix was revised on December 17, 2015, to provide additional information on the definition of 

core import inflation and its implications for the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with stable 

inflation.  In addition, the original version of the appendix incorrectly reported that the adjustment factor 

used to convert historical readings on expected long-run inflation from a CPI basis to a PCE basis was 

50 basis points.

points prior to 2007 to put the CPI forecasts on a PCE basis.  (Prior to 1991:Q4, this 

series is based on the long-run inflation expectations reported in the Hoey survey.)  The 

relative import price term, 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡, is defined as the annualized growth rate of the price 

index for core imported goods (defined to exclude petroleum, natural gas, computers, and 

semiconductors), less the lagged four-quarter change in core PCE inflation, all multiplied 

by the share of nominal core imported goods in nominal GDP.36 

To decompose recent movements in inflation into its various components, the 

series used in the inflation model--for which data are available only through 2015:Q2 in 

most cases--are first extended through the end of 2015.  In the case of inflation, the 

extensions are consistent with the medians of FOMC participants’ projections for total 

and core PCE inflation in 2015 that were reported at the press conference following the 

September FOMC meeting.37  Similarly, 𝑆𝐿𝐴𝐶𝐾𝑡 over the second half of 2015 is defined 

to be consistent with the median of FOMC projections for the 2015:Q4 unemployment 

rate, less the CBO’s estimates of the historical path of the long-run natural rate; the 

CBO’s 2015 estimate is almost identical to the median of FOMC participants’ most 

recent projections of the normal longer-run level of the unemployment rate.  For changes 

in the prices of consumer energy and core imports, the 2015:H2 extrapolations are based 

on regressions of these two series on current and lagged changes in, respectively, crude 

oil prices and exchange rates.  This approach predicts that energy prices should decline at 

annual rates of about 6 percent in 2015:Q3 and 18 percent in 2015:Q4, while core import 

                                                 
36 This measure of core import prices is constructed by Board staff using published and unpublished data 

provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   
37 The information on participants’ forecasts provided at the September 17, 2015, press conference is 

available on the Board’s website at 

www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20150917.pdf.

prices should fall about 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in both quarters.38  Food prices are 

assumed to remain flat at their 2015:Q2 level; this assumption ensures that the combined 

contribution of food and energy prices to inflation in 2015 is consistent with the median 

difference between FOMC participants’ projections for total and core inflation.  Finally, 

nominal spending shares for food, energy, and core imports are assumed to remain 

unchanged at their 2015:Q2 levels, and long-run inflation expectations are assumed to 

remain constant at 2 percent.   

After computing historical 𝜖𝑡 tracking errors for the two equations of the model, 

the final step in the decomposition procedure is to run a sequence of counter-factual 

simulations of the model from 1990:Q1 through 2015:Q4.  One by one, each explanatory 

variable of the model is set to zero and the model is simulated; the resulting difference 

between actual inflation and its simulated value equals the historical contribution of that 

particular factor.  Importantly, the simulations are all dynamic in that the lagged inflation 

term in the core inflation equation is set equal to its simulated value in the preceding 

period, rather than its actual value.  As a result, the decompositions incorporate the 

effects of changes in lagged inflation that are attributable to previous movements in the 

explanatory variables. 

                                                 
38 The level of core import prices, expressed relative to core consumer prices, displayed a modest 

downward trend from 1990 through 2001 but since then has displayed little persistent trend, particularly if 

one controls for shifts related to recent changes in the real exchange rate.  If the post-2001 pattern persists 

in coming years, then 𝑅𝑃𝐼𝑀𝑡 would be expected to converge to zero within a few quarters and core PCE 
inflation to converge to 2 percent within two or three years, assuming that the unemployment rate remains 

close to 5 percent (the CBO estimate of the natural rate) and there are no further shocks to the exchange 

rate and other factors.  If, however, core import prices were expected to resume trending down relative to 

consumer prices, then the model as specified would imply that the unemployment rate consistent with 

inflation stabilizing at 2 percent in the longer run would be somewhat lower than 5 percent.
