I am happy to be here today, and I thank the organizers for inviting me.1  It is a 

particular pleasure to be back in Israel, where my career as a central banker began.  At 

the Fed, I face a somewhat different set of responsibilities, and my lecture today is on the 

special challenges that face the Federal Reserve and the global economy in an 

increasingly interconnected world.2   

Over the past 50 years, global trade has more than tripled relative to world gross 

domestic product (GDP), and the ratio of total exports to global GDP now stands at about 

30 percent--though, interestingly, the rate of growth of global international trade has 

declined to the level of the growth rate of world GDP since the start of the Great 

Recession.  International trade has not loomed as large in the U.S. national accounts as it 

has for many other countries, but it is an increasingly important driver of the U.S. 

economy, with the share of trade in U.S. GDP currently at about 15 percent.   

Although the U.S. share of world GDP has gradually declined since the mid-20th 

century, the broader importance of the United States to the global economy has 

diminished less, as a result of increasing financial linkages.  In particular, U.S. residents’ 

ownership of private foreign assets has risen from 6.5 percent of U.S. annual GDP in 

1950 to more than 140 percent of annual U.S. GDP (nearly $25 trillion), reflecting the 

leading role of U.S. capital markets in cross-border finance.  Total foreign investment in 

the United States is even larger, at more than $30 trillion.   

                                                 
1 I am grateful to John Ammer, Christopher Erceg, Joseph Gruber, and Beth Anne Wilson of the Federal 
Reserve Board’s staff for their assistance in preparing these remarks.   
2 This lecture is an updated and shortened version of the Per Jacobsson lecture that I delivered in October 
2014.

In a progressively integrating world economy and financial system, a central bank 

cannot ignore developments beyond its country’s borders, and the Fed is no exception.  

This is true even though the Fed’s statutory objectives are defined as specific goals for 

the U.S. economy.  In particular, the Federal Reserve’s objectives are given by its dual 

mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability, and our policy 

decisions are targeted to achieve these dual objectives.3  Hence, at first blush, it may 

seem that there is little need for Fed policymakers to pay attention to developments 

outside the United States.   

But such an inference would be incorrect. The state of the U.S. economy is 

significantly affected by the state of the world economy.  A wide range of foreign shocks 

affect U.S. domestic spending, production, prices, and financial conditions.  To anticipate 

how these shocks affect the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve devotes significant 

resources to monitoring developments in foreign economies, including emerging market 

economies (EMEs), which account for an increasingly important share of global growth.  

The most recent available data show 47 percent of total U.S. exports going to EME 

destinations.  And of course, actions taken by the Federal Reserve influence economic 

conditions abroad.4  Because these international effects in turn spill back on the evolution 

of the U.S. economy, we cannot make sensible monetary policy choices without taking 

them into account.  

                                                 
3 The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has judged that 2 percent inflation in the price of personal 
consumption expenditures is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve’s statutory 
mandate.  For more information, see Federal Open Market Committee (2014).  The Fed also has separate 
responsibilities for promoting financial stability (some of which are spelled out in the Dodd-Frank Wall 
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010) that are, in many respects, complementary to the dual 
mandate.  See Yellen (2014) for further discussion.   
4 For a discussion of the effect of Federal Reserve actions on international economic conditions, see Rey 
(2015).

In this lecture, I would like to emphasize both aspects of our global 

connectedness--spillovers from the United States to foreign economies and the effect of 

foreign economies on the United States.   

I. International Transmission of Monetary Policies 

The recognition that a change in interest rates in one nation can spill over to other 

countries dates back at least to the 18th-century writings of David Hume on the 

international effect of changes in the money supply.5  The standard models incorporating 

the international transmission of monetary policy were developed by Marcus Fleming 

and Robert Mundell.  In the Mundell-Fleming framework, as well as in modern 

developments of the same theme, a shift toward a more accommodative monetary policy 

in the United States spills over to foreign economies by causing their interest rates to 

fall--though typically by less than in the United States--and their currencies to appreciate 

against the dollar.  At the same time, international capital flows tend to shift toward 

foreign economies in response to their relatively more attractive interest rates.   

The pass-through of changes in U.S. policy rates abroad depends importantly on 

how foreign monetary authorities respond.  A decline in U.S. policy rates has a relatively 

large effect on foreign policy rates in economies that opt to limit exchange rate 

fluctuations, at least for economies with reasonably open capital accounts.  By contrast, a 

central bank in an economy with a freely floating exchange rate might choose to lower its 

interest rate by a much smaller amount than in the United States if it believes that 

domestic conditions so warrant.  In this case, the country’s exchange rate would 

                                                 
5 See Hume (1742).

appreciate as investors rebalance their portfolios in favor of assets denominated in its 

currency in response to the higher interest rate differential.6   

There is also evidence that monetary policy actions can influence investors’ 

willingness to hold risky assets, the so-called risk-taking channel.7  Such effects seem to 

be most potent when financial conditions are stressed.  And countries that offer high 

prospective returns but have weak policy frameworks or other structural vulnerabilities 

may be particularly sensitive to fluctuations in international investment associated with 

global risk factors.8   

Effects of monetary accommodation since the global financial crisis 

After the 2007-08 global financial crisis, there has been heightened concern about 

the international spillovers of monetary policies--and of ours, in particular.  Some EME 

critics argued that U.S. policy accommodation contributed to a surge of capital inflows 

and excessive credit growth in their economies, creating risks of financial instability.  

But, as time wore on, most EMEs seemed glad to receive those flows.   

There is little doubt that the aggressive actions the Federal Reserve took to 

mitigate the effects of the global financial crisis significantly affected asset prices at 

                                                 
6 See Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962).  One key implication of the Mundell-Fleming framework is that 
a central bank can exercise full control over both the exchange rate and the domestic interest rate only 
when there are significant barriers to the international capital mobility.  Accordingly, policymakers face the 
constraint of the “impossible trinity,” which states that a country cannot simultaneously have an 
independent monetary policy, free capital movement, and a fixed exchange rate.  
7  Several recent papers discuss risk-taking channels through which monetary policy influences financial 
conditions more broadly than the level of safe interest rates.  See Borio and Zhu (2012), Rey (2015), Morris 
and Shin (2014), Bruno and Shin (2015), and the Hanson and Stein (2015) “reaching for yield” concept.   
8  Studies using panel data typically have found that country-specific factors help explain cross-sectional 
differences in international investment and capital flows.  See, for example, Furceri, Guichard, and 
Rusticelli (2011); Fratzscher (2012); and Luca and Spatafora (2012).  Avdjiev and Takáts’s (2014) study of 
cross-border bank lending during the “taper tantrum” shows a larger pullback for countries with weaker 
current account balances, and Sahay and others (2014) find that country-specific market reactions during 
this period also were affected by high inflation, weak growth prospects, and relatively low reserves.

home and abroad as well as international capital flows.  While the Fed’s asset purchases 

were composed wholly of Treasury, agency, and agency-backed securities (for legal and 

practical reasons), the program also aimed to boost the prices of riskier assets and ease 

financial conditions for the private sector.9  (And this is what the textbooks say the 

program should have done.)  The preponderance of evidence suggests that the Fed’s asset 

purchases raised the prices of the assets purchased and close substitutes as well as those 

of riskier assets.10   

Importantly, evidence shows that foreign asset markets have been significantly 

affected by the Fed’s purchase programs.11  For example, event studies of announcements 

associated with the Fed’s purchase programs have found that they prompted inflows into 

investment funds holding both foreign debt and foreign equity securities.   

Of course, other countries’ monetary policy announcements can also leave an 

imprint on international asset prices, with market reactions to new initiatives enacted by 

the European Central Bank (ECB) one recent example.12  However, event studies tend to 

find larger international interest rate spillovers for U.S. policy announcements than for 

those of other central banks.13   

                                                 
9  See, for example, Bernanke (2010a, 2010b).  
10  See, for example, D’Amico and King (2013); Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2011); Hamilton 
and Wu (2012); and Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014).   
11  See Neely (2011); Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub (2013); Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014); and 
Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014).  Also, Ahmed and Zlate (2014) show that both conventional and 
nonconventional U.S. monetary expansion have driven capital flows into EMEs.  
12 See Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014) and Chen, Filardo, He, and Zhu (2012) for more systematic 
evidence.   
13  See, for example, Rogers, Scotti, and Wright’s (2014) recent event study of central bank announcement 
effects on sovereign yields in different countries.  Similarly, earlier work by Ehrmann and Fratzscher 
(2005) finds larger reactions in euro-area interest rates to U.S. rate changes than vice versa.   




- 6 - 

Earlier studies of the international effects of conventional U.S. monetary policy--

namely, changes in the policy rate--have also found significant spillovers to asset prices 

in other countries.14  Studies that have compared the spillovers of monetary policy across 

conventional and unconventional measures generally conclude that the effects on global 

financial markets are roughly similar.15  

Given the relatively fast recovery of many EMEs from the crisis, post-crisis 

monetary accommodation in the United States and other advanced economies created 

policy challenges for many EMEs.16  If they resisted currency appreciation pressures by 

lowering their policy rates, they risked overstimulating domestic demand, exacerbating 

financial excesses, and overheating their economies.  If, instead, they reduced their policy 

rates less than the United States had done while intervening to resist currency 

appreciation, capital inflows could have increased further, thus partially offsetting their 

attempts to stabilize their economies.  And, if they allowed currency appreciation 

pressures to pass through to their full extent, this could threaten their recoveries by 

hurting exports.  In the event, EMEs tried to make the best of a difficult set of tradeoffs 

by allowing some exchange rate appreciation, partially reducing their interest rates, and 

in some countries also using capital controls.   

                                                 
14  See, for example, Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2009) and Hausman and Wongswan (2011).   
15  Among studies of spillovers from conventional versus unconventional U.S. monetary policy, Rogers, 
Scotti, and Wright (2014) report no significant differences in relative announcement effects on advanced 
foreign economy asset prices and Treasury yields; Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2014) find similar 
EME asset price responses; Takáts and Vela (2014) report mixed results for EMEs, with a weaker post-
2007 relationship in levels of EME policy rates with U.S. rates but a stronger post-2008 relationship in 
levels of five-year yields; and Glick and Leduc (2013) also report similar spillovers to exchange rates.  The 
effects of the Bank of England’s quantitative easing program on corporate bond yields and sterling 
exchange rates are similar to predictions from a model estimated over an earlier period by Joyce, Lasaosa, 
Stevens, and Tong (2011).  
16  See the discussion in Bernanke (2012).

I would also argue strongly that U.S. monetary policies were not beggar thy 

neighbor policies in that, on balance, they generally did not drain demand from other 

economies.  Federal Reserve staff analysis finds that an easing of monetary policy in the 

United States benefits foreign economies from both stronger U.S. activity and improved 

global financial conditions.   

The “taper tantrum” of 2013 

We should also expect spillovers when monetary policy is tightened.  Central 

bank communications can be a tricky business.  And indeed, financial markets reacted 

strongly to the first statements by Chairman Bernanke in the spring of 2013 that the Fed’s 

asset purchases were likely to decelerate in the near future and come to an end not long 

after that.  Some market participants clearly understood these statements to be broadly in 

line with previous guidance about the eventual normalization of policy as recovery of the 

U.S. economy took hold.  But others may have grown accustomed to continuing asset 

purchases; the most recent program of quantitative easing, commonly referred to as QE3, 

had been first announced less than a year before and was proceeding at a steady pace of 

$85 billion per month.   

The onset of the taper tantrum went well beyond a roiling of U.S. financial 

markets.  Spillovers to other advanced-economy financial markets included stock price 

declines, significant increases in sovereign yields, higher overnight interest swap rates in 

the United Kingdom and euro area, and rising credit spreads in some countries.  




- 8 - 

Spillovers to EME asset markets were significantly stronger.  Inflows to EME investment 

funds reversed sharply, EME currencies depreciated, and other asset prices declined.17  

II. Normalization of Monetary Policies 

The cumulative effects over half of a decade of the extraordinary actions by the 

Federal Reserve and other central banks will need to be unwound in the coming years as 

the U.S. and other economies make progress toward economic recovery.  In the 

normalizing of its policy, just as when loosening policy, the Federal Reserve will take 

account of how its actions affect the global economy.   

The taper tantrum episode notwithstanding, most EMEs have generally weathered 

the wind-down of our asset purchases reasonably well so far.  The actual raising of policy 

rates could trigger further bouts of volatility, but my best estimate is that the 

normalization of our policy should prove manageable for the EMEs.  We have done 

everything we can, within the limits of forecast uncertainty, to prepare market 

participants for what lies ahead.   

The Federal Reserve and other central banks are going to great lengths to 

communicate policy intentions and strategies clearly.  Given this, markets should not be 

greatly surprised by either the timing or the pace of normalization.  In fact, it bears 

mentioning that, following the taper tantrum, when the Fed started to taper its purchases, 

there was little reaction from markets.   

                                                 
17 Powell (2013) notes that EMEs with larger current account deficits experienced both greater 
depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields in mid-2013, suggesting that, 
while a reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the retrenchment from EME assets, 
investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the reactions.   




- 9 - 

The tightening of U.S. policy will begin only when the U.S. expansion has 

advanced far enough--when we have seen further improvement in the labor market and 

when we are reasonably confident that the inflation rate will rise to our 2 percent goal.18   

The stronger U.S. economy should directly benefit our foreign trading partners by raising 

the demand for their exports, and perhaps also indirectly, by boosting confidence 

globally.  And if foreign growth is weaker than anticipated, the consequences for the U.S. 

economy could lead the Fed to remove accommodation more slowly than otherwise.   

The EMEs themselves have generally done a good job of reducing their financial 

and economic vulnerabilities over the past couple of decades, which should bolster their 

resilience should normalization lead to financial market stresses.  Since the 1990s, many 

EMEs have made remarkable progress in reducing inflation, improving government debt 

ratios, building foreign reserves, and better regulating and capitalizing their banking 

systems.  In addition, the development of local-currency debt markets has made EMEs 

less vulnerable to exchange rate fluctuations.  To be sure, some EMEs continue to face a 

wide array of structural and policy challenges, including, prominently, rapid credit 

growth.  But it does not seem that the overall risks to global financial stability are 

unusually elevated at this time.   

Nevertheless, it could be that some more vulnerable economies, including those 

that pursue overly rigid exchange rate policies, may find the road to normalization 

somewhat bumpier.  This gives all the more reason for the Fed and other major central 

banks to communicate policy intentions clearly and for EMEs to continue to strengthen 

                                                 
18 See Yellen (2015) for further discussion of the determinants of the pace of normalization.

their policy frameworks and to consider their own policy responses to the forthcoming 

normalization in the United States and some other advanced economies.   

III. The Fed’s Responsibility to the Global Economy 

So far, I have focused on the immediate spillovers of U.S. monetary policy abroad 

and the feedback of those effects to the U.S. economy.  More tacitly than explicitly stated 

has been my view that the United States is not just any economy and, thus, the Federal 

Reserve not just any central bank.  The U.S. economy represents nearly one-fourth of the 

global economy measured at market rates and a similar share of gross capital flows.  The 

significant size and international linkages of the U.S. economy mean that economic and 

financial developments in the United States have global spillovers.  It is, therefore, 

important to ask, what is the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to the global economy?   

First and foremost, it is to keep our own house in order.  Economic and financial 

volatility in any country can have negative consequences for the world, but sizable and 

significant spillovers are almost assured from an economy that is large.  There is no 

question that sharp declines in U.S. output or large deviations of U.S. inflation from its 

target level would have adverse effects on the global economy.  Conversely, strong and 

stable U.S. growth in the context of inflation close to our policy objective has substantial 

benefits for the world.  Thus, as part of our efforts to achieve our congressionally 

mandated objective of maximum sustainable employment and price stability, the Federal 

Reserve will also seek to minimize adverse spillovers and maximize the beneficial effect 

of the U.S. economy on the global economy.   

As the recent financial crisis showed all too clearly, to achieve this objective, we 

must take financial stability into account.  For half a decade, we have been working to 




- 11 - 

understand and better guard against the financial disruptions that were the genesis of the 

Great Recession.  These efforts have spawned many speeches, including some of my 

own, which testify to our efforts.19  In these speeches, we often emphasize that, given the 

integration of global capital markets, what happens in one market affects others.  Thus, 

our efforts to stabilize the U.S. financial system also have positive spillovers abroad.   

These financial stability responsibilities do not stop at our borders, given the size 

and openness of our capital markets and the unique position of the U.S. dollar as the 

world’s leading currency for financial transactions.  For example, the global financial 

crisis highlighted the extent of borrowing and lending in U.S. dollars by foreign financial 

institutions.  When these institutions came under pressure, their actions contributed to the 

strains in both foreign and domestic dollar funding markets.  To achieve financial 

stability domestically and maintain the flow of credit to American households and 

businesses, we took action.  Importantly, we developed swap facilities with central banks 

in countries that represented major financial markets or trading centers in order to 

facilitate the provision of dollar liquidity to these markets.   

We did so in recognition of the scope of dollar markets and dollar-denominated 

transactions outside of our country, the benefits they provide to U.S. households and 

firms, and the adverse consequences to our financial markets if these centers lose access 

to dollar liquidity.  We have continued to maintain swap facilities with a number of 

                                                 
19 Bernanke (2014), Fischer (2014), and Tarullo (2014) also discuss concrete steps that U.S. authorities 
have taken in the past five years to implement financial reform of large financial institutions (including 
introducing a systematic framework for stress-testing, stronger capital and liquidity requirements, and 
progress on resolution mechanisms for failed institutions), of financial market infrastructures, and in short-
term funding markets.   




- 12 - 

central banks.  Although usage is currently very low, these facilities represent an 

important backstop in the event of a resurgence in global financial tensions.   

But I should caution that the responsibility of the Fed is not unbounded.  My 

teacher Charles Kindleberger argued that stability of the international financial system 

could best be supported by the leadership of a financial hegemon or a global central 

bank.20  But I should be clear that the U.S. Federal Reserve System is not that bank.  Our 

mandate, like that of virtually all central banks, focuses on domestic objectives.  As I 

have described, to meet those domestic objectives, we must recognize the effect of our 

actions abroad, and, by meeting those domestic objectives, we best minimize the negative 

spillovers we have to the global economy.  And because the dollar features so 

prominently in international transactions, we must be mindful that our markets extend 

beyond our borders and take precautions, as we have done before, to provide liquidity 

when necessary.   

That said, the world is not without other resources to guard against adverse 

economic and financial spillovers.  Most obviously, the International Monetary Fund has 

played and will continue to play a critical role in providing liquidity and financial support 

to its member countries.  In the United States, we are working to ensure that our financial 

institutions and other market participants are prepared for the normalization of monetary 

policy and the return to a world of higher interest rates.  It is equally important that 

individuals, businesses, and institutions around the world do the same.  For our part, the 

Federal Reserve will promote a smooth transition by communicating our assessment of 

the economy and our policy intentions as clearly as possible.  

                                                 
20 See Kindleberger (1986).

IV. Concluding Remarks  

To summarize and conclude, the Fed’s statutory objectives are defined by its dual 

mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability in the U.S. 

economy.  But the U.S. economy and the economies of the rest of the world have 

important feedback effects on each other.  To make coherent policy choices, we have to 

take these feedback effects into account.  The most important contribution that U.S. 

policymakers can make to the health of the world economy is to keep our own house in 

order--and the same goes for all countries.  Because the dollar is the primary international 

currency, we have, in the past, had to take action--particularly in times of global 

economic crisis--to maintain order in international capital markets, such as the central 

bank liquidity swap lines extended during the global financial crisis.  In that case, we 

were acting in accordance with our dual mandate, in the interest of the U.S. economy, by 

taking actions that also benefit the world economy.  Going forward, we will continue to 

be guided by those same principles.
