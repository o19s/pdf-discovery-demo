Thank you, and I also would like to thank the organizers of this forum for 

arranging for me to be part of your conversation, on a day when other business 

unfortunately prevents me from travelling to Kansas City.   

And I am really looking forward to hearing from all of you on what I expect will 

be a range of topics, but I thought I might start with a few remarks about something of 

considerable interest to me, which is diversity and inclusion. 

I think the Kansas City Fed is an excellent place to discuss this issue because of 

the recognition it has received for promoting diversity and inclusion, both among 

businesses and other organizations in the 10th District and in its own ranks.  I know that 

the Bank is continuing to hold Diversity Summits with firms and community groups, the 

most recent of which was last month.  In various ways, it is also promoting diversity 

among its own staff and senior leaders through recruiting, hiring and promotions, and is 

closely tracking progress.  The Greater Kansas City Chamber of Commerce singled out 

the Bank this year for its diversity efforts from among 20 organizations and businesses. 

I believe these efforts reflect a commitment to diversity that is found throughout 

the Federal Reserve System, and I would like to talk a bit about the basis for that 

commitment, starting with why it is that diversity, in its different forms, is so important.   

One reason that the Fed organizes conferences such as this one is to facilitate 

communication.  In this case, we want to communicate with you, as leaders of institutions 

we oversee and are otherwise affected by our decisions.  We want to understand your 

views and try to explain what we are trying to accomplish.  Such communication would 

not be effective if only one or just a few banks in the 10th District were part of the 

conversation.  Today’s forum includes bankers from smaller community banks, regional 


 - 2 - 

banks, and large banks because the roles of your institutions in your communities differ, 

and hearing your different views provides a fuller picture of the industry’s views.  

Similarly, it is important to include in the conversation bankers of diverse backgrounds, 

which is why it is important that we hear from minority bankers. 

In these examples, diversity in its various forms is a source of strength, which is 

something that we as financial regulators understand very well.  The Federal Reserve 

supports an ongoing role for community banks in part because diversity among financial 

institutions promotes a stable and healthy financial system, spurring competition and 

ensuring that customers of all types have access to a wide variety of services.  The 

Federal Reserve supports the Partnership for Progress, which assists and advises 

minority-owned financial institutions, because we believe that those institutions are 

likewise a source of diversity that contributes to a healthy financial system. 

I expect it is not news, either, to bankers, that diversity is a source of strength.  

Every day, in serving customers, bankers can see the strength that comes from diversity--

the wisdom of diversification in investment decisions, in diverse product lines for the 

businesses you lend to, and especially in the strength of diverse communities.    

Diversity also strengthens organizations by making it possible to have a wide 

variety of views available.  It helps ensure that individuals within those organizations 

have the opportunity to shine and employ their talents to the fullest and that their best 

ideas are heard and acted on.  The banks you serve are better able to reach new 

customers, especially groups of customers who have historically been underbanked, when 

they show that serving those customers is a top priority.  And one of the most effective 

ways of showing a commitment to a diverse customer base is showing a commitment to a 


 - 3 - 

diverse workforce.  Demographic trends indicate that minorities will be an increasing 

share of the population in the years and decades ahead, and thus an increasing share of 

new customers for your institutions. 

My organization, the Federal Reserve, is also committed to a diverse workforce 

and to diversity in our senior leadership.  The Federal Reserve is pursuing this goal not 

only for all of the practical reasons I have cited to seek diversity, but also because it is the 

right thing to do.  I want to be clear to all of you that I am committed to improving 

diversity throughout our organization, including at the upper ranks.  Diversity is also 

important on the boards of directors and advisory councils of Reserve Banks.  I hope, in 

fact, that in this room today there are individuals who one day may serve as an advisor, 

director or even a Reserve Bank President or member of the Board of Governors. 

Improving diversity requires effort and constant focus.  We will continue working 

hard to achieve this goal.  I believe it is as vital to the Federal Reserve as it is to your 

employers, and to every employer, to improve diversity and extend opportunity to 

everyone.
