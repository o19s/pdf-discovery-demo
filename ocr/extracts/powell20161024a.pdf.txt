  This panel will focus on the settlement infrastructure for U.S. government securities -- a 

vital component of the Treasury market and one that is undergoing an important transition.  This 

segment of the industry has been in a period of slow but steady consolidation for several decades 

now.  Thirty years ago, there were six banks providing a full suite of settlement services for U.S. 

government securities.  Due to mergers and exits, two firms, Bank of New York Mellon 

(BNYM) and J.P. Morgan Chase (JPMC), have been the two dominant providers of these 

services since the 1990s.  And soon there will be just one, given JPMC’s planned exit. 

  Given the importance of these services, the official sector has had a long involvement as 

the market structure has evolved.  After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Federal 

Reserve convened the private-sector Working Group on Government Securities Clearance and 

Settlement to recommend steps to mitigate risks to the financial system from a disruption to 

these services.  That work led to the “NewBank” proposal.1  Although the proposal was 

ultimately put aside, NewBank would have been a dormant financial institution that could spring 

into action in the event of potential disruptions from an exit from this business by either of the 

clearing banks. Some of today’s panelists were actively involved in that work.  Of course, at that 

time, the business was roughly evenly split between the two providers.   Today’s situation is very 

different – BNYM now has over 80 percent market share, due mainly to consolidation among 

end users.    

 The Federal Reserve has been working closely with the Department of the Treasury to 

ensure a smooth transition as JPMC prepares to exit.   JPMC has said that it recognizes the need

for, and its own interest in, ensuring that its exit does not disrupt the market.  Indeed, JPMC will 

itself need to rely on these services going forward.  The timeline set for a gradual transition over 

the next two years should be sufficient to avoid significant dislocations; however, if unexpected 

complications arise, that timeline may need to be adjusted.  

  In the near term, this exit will leave BNYM as the sole provider of U.S. government 

securities settlement and triparty repo services for broker-dealers.  We have been working 

intensively with BNYM in anticipation of this transition.  We have long recognized that any 

disruptions to these critical market services could have serious consequences for financial 

stability, and have calibrated our supervisory expectations accordingly.  To ensure financial 

stability, we expect the provision of U.S. government securities settlement services to be robust 

in nearly all contingencies. 

  As BNYM becomes the sole provider, we will raise our expectations even higher.  The 

bank has anticipated and welcomed this higher bar.  BNYM is one of 8 U.S.-based systemically 

important banks.  The bank is therefore subject to heightened capital and liquidity requirements 

and a resolution process that explicitly requires planning to ensure the continuity of critical 

services even in the event of a default.   

   BNYM is unique in that it also plays the dominant – and soon the sole – role in 

government securities settlement and in the triparty repo market.  These activities are comparable 

in their importance to those of the financial market utilities that have been designated as 

systemically important by the FSOC.  Thus, BNYM will continue to be held to the high 

standards to which all U.S. bank SIFIs are held.  And it will also be expected to operate in a 

manner that provides confidence that it is as resilient and robust as a systemically important 

financial market utility (FMU).  Such FMUs are, of course, held to the Principles for Financial

Market Infrastructures (PFMIs).2   The PFMIs overlap with our banking regulation in many 

areas; for example, both emphasize the need for sound risk management and the importance of 

resilience and recovery.  The PFMIs also emphasize a strong governance role in support of 

financial stability and the interests of market functioning, and this has been a focus of our work 

with Bank of New York Mellon regarding the transition.         

  Although our current task is to establish appropriate expectations for Bank of New York 

Mellon as a sole operator, that focus should not be taken as an indication that the Federal 

Reserve or other public authorities have pre-judged what the longer-term landscape for 

government securities settlement should look like.  In fact, we do not have a specific market 

design end state in mind.  Rather, we recognize the systemic importance of these activities and 

the need to ensure their continued availability in nearly all states of the world, regardless of the 

firms that offer them or the specific market structure.   

  The industry as a whole should play an important role in shaping the evolution of the 

settlement infrastructure.  Other firms may seek to enter this market. There have also been 

discussions over time of a settlement utility, and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation is 

currently considering a new variant of such a model.  Our focus is on the quality of the services 

offered -- their safety, resilience, and support of the market -- and not on the particular 

mechanism for offering them.  If new proposals come forward that are consistent with our goals 

of a safe and resilient settlement system, then they will receive fair consideration.
