With today’s data in the news, I will first say a few words about labor market 

conditions before moving on to discuss the economic outlook and monetary policy.1  

The labor market has, by and large, had a pretty good year.  Including this 

morning’s release for October, payrolls have increased an average of 181,000 per month 

this year, a slower pace than last year but enough to keep the unemployment rate flat at 

about 5 percent.  The unchanged unemployment rate reflects a positive, though perhaps 

transitory, development--mainly a pickup in labor force participation.  The rise in 

participation may reflect the effects of the modest pickup in wages we are now seeing, 

with the rate of increase in the employment cost index having risen from an annual rate of 

about 2 percent last year to 2-1/4 percent so far this year.      

Over the course of the past two years, a variety of negative shocks have affected 

the U.S. economy, but employment has resumed robust growth after each temporary 

slowdown:  This recovery has been and continues to be powerful in terms of one of our 

two main targets--employment--and it is my view that the labor market is close to full 

employment. 

It is nonetheless interesting to ask what level of payroll gains would maintain an 

unemployment rate of roughly 5 percent.  Unsurprisingly, the level of payroll gains 

consistent with an unchanged unemployment rate is highly dependent on developments in 

labor force participation.  If labor force participation was to remain flat, job gains in the 

range of 125,000 to 175,000 would likely be needed to prevent unemployment from 

creeping up.  However, if labor force participation was to decline, as might be expected

Market Committee.

given demographic trends, the neutral rate of payroll gains would be lower.  If we 

assumed a downward trend in participation of about 0.3 percentage point per year, in line 

with estimates of the likely drag from demographics, job gains in the range of 65,000 to 

115,000 would likely be sufficient to maintain full employment.   

Last week we received some encouraging news on output growth.  After a slow 

first half, real gross domestic product (GDP) increased almost 3 percent in the third 

quarter.  However, the details were a little less exciting than the headline number.  

Household spending growth slowed, and residential investment declined.  Business 

investment in equipment fell for the fourth consecutive quarter.  A surge in exports 

supported growth; however, much of the increase was in shipments of soybeans, while 

exports of other goods remained tepid.  Growth was also supported by a buildup in 

inventories, breaking a streak of five quarters in which inventories contributed negatively 

to growth, the longest such run in more than 50 years.  Overall, I expect GDP growth to 

continue at a moderate pace, supported by household spending, renewed business 

investment, and the waning effects of past dollar appreciation on export growth.  

I will now turn to inflation.  Headline PCE (personal consumption expenditures) 

inflation has moved up this year, with the 12-month change reaching 1.2 percent in 

September.  As the transitory effects of the earlier fall in oil prices and rise in the dollar 

fade, PCE inflation can be expected to rise further toward our 2 percent target, supported 

by higher core PCE inflation, which ran at a 1.7 percent pace in September.   

As you know, earlier this week, we decided to keep the target range for the 

federal funds rate at 1/4 to 1/2 percent.  As was noted in the Federal Open Market 

Committee’s statement, our assessment is that the most recent data have further

strengthened the case for increasing the target range for the federal funds rate.2  The 

markets put a probability of above 70 percent on the rate being increased in December. 

 So far I’ve been discussing our near-term economic prospects.  But the more 

interesting and important questions relate to the next few years rather than the next few 

months.  They relate in large part to the secular stagnation arguments that were laid out 

yesterday in Larry Summers’ Mundell-Fleming lecture--in particular the behavior of the 

rate of productivity growth.  The statement that the problem we face is largely one of 

demand--and we do face that problem--seems to imply either that productivity growth is 

called forth by aggregate demand, or a Say’s Law of productivity growth, namely that 

productivity growth produces its own demand.   

 That is not an issue that can be answered purely by theorizing.  Rather, it will be 

answered by the behavior of output and inflation as we approach and perhaps to some 

extent exceed our employment and inflation targets.
