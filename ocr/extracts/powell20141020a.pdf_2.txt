Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today about some of the key issues 

facing community banks.  As the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board’s community and 

regional bank subcommittee, I try to meet with groups of community bankers whenever I can to 

better understand what is on community bankers’ minds.  While today’s webinar is no substitute 

for face-to-face meetings with bankers, it is a special treat to be able to leverage technology to 

speak to and hear from so many community bankers across the country at the same time. 

As all of you surely know, community banks play a vital role in the U.S. financial 

system.  Community banks have strong links to the people and businesses in their communities, 

as well as direct knowledge of local economic conditions.  These close ties give community 

bankers a clear advantage in understanding local needs and tailoring their products and services 

to meet those needs.  

My colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board and I are committed to making sure that we 

understand the issues that are most important to community banks as you strive to serve the 

financial needs of your communities.  One way that we further our understanding is by talking to 

the bankers themselves in a variety of venues, such as this webinar and a community banking 

research conference that I attended last month in St. Louis, which was co-sponsored by the 

Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.   

And there is another opportunity to communicate with the Federal Reserve and our 

fellow regulators that I want to make sure you are aware of.  The Economic Growth and 

Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) of 1996 tasked financial regulators with 

reviewing regulations issued by the agencies at least every 10 years to identify outdated, 

unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations.  The agencies kicked off that process earlier this 

year, and in addition to collecting comments in writing, we are beginning a series of meetings
