Why Opportunity and Inclusion Matter to America’s Economic Strength 
 
 
 

Remarks by

Member 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the 
 

Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute Conference, sponsored by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 

 
Minneapolis, Minnesota 


May 22, 2017



I want to thank Neel Kashkari for launching the Opportunity and Inclusive 

Growth Institute and for inviting me to join the deliberations of this distinguished group 

today.  This new Institute is another great example of how individual Reserve Banks are 

taking the initiative in illuminating key dimensions of our work and shaping the agenda 

of the Federal Reserve System.1   

While it has long been understood that opportunity is central to the strength of 

America’s social fabric, it is now increasingly clear that opportunity and inclusion are 

central to the strength of America’s economy.  I will touch on the key ways that 

opportunity and inclusion matter for policymaking at the Federal Reserve, ranging from 

our dual-mandate goal of maximum employment to our monitoring of household 

financial health to our engagement in low- and moderate-income communities all over 

the country.  I will focus on how our work intersects with the groundbreaking work of the 

accomplished group of researchers assembled here.   

In the original design of the Federal Reserve, it was recognized that the American 

economy is not monolithic; that is why the Congress created our system of 12 Federal 

Reserve Districts.  We are present in communities all across America through our 

Reserve Banks and Branches and their boards and advisory councils.  This local 

presence, by design, gives us valuable perspectives on how Americans are experiencing 

the economy in different communities around the country and critical insights about the 

varied challenges that lie beneath the aggregate numbers.  In turn, our local engagement 

                                                 
I am grateful to David Buchholz, Jeff Larrimore, Amanda Roberts, Claudia Sahm, and Jenny Schuetz for 
their assistance in preparing this text.

helps stakeholders in these communities partner to improve opportunity and inclusive 

growth.  

Inclusion and Maximum Employment 

Inclusion is an enduring goal of public policy that is embodied in our maximum-

employment mandate.  The Employment Act of 1946 charges the federal government 

with creating “conditions under which there will be afforded useful employment for those 

able, willing, and seeking to work, and to promote maximum employment, production, 

and purchasing power.”2  Maximum employment is inherently an inclusive goal.  In 

1977, the Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act to make achieving maximum 

employment an explicit objective of monetary policy, along with stable prices.  In 

fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target 

of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum 

employment.  That is because the level of maximum employment depends on 

“nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,” which 

can change in important ways over time.3   

The recognition that maximum employment evolves over time to reflect changes 

in the economic landscape serves us well.  It puts the onus on members of the FOMC to 

analyze the changing features of the labor market and develop a nuanced understanding 

of the different margins of slack.  This approach to maximum employment has allowed 

                                                 
2 See the Employment Act of 1946, Pub. L. No. 79-304, § 2, 60 Stat. 23, 23 (1946). 
3 The FOMC’s inflation target was adopted in January 2012 in the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and 
Monetary Policy Strategy.  It was amended in January 2017 to clarify that the target is symmetric around 
2 percent; the most recent Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy (in which the 
quoted text appears in paragraph 3) is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf.  For the interim period, 
Thornton (2012) and Steelman (2011) document the evolution of views among FOMC members on the 
dual mandate.

the FOMC to navigate the current recovery in a way that has likely brought more people 

back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed, aggregate 

unemployment-rate target based on pre-crisis norms, in effect, achieving more inclusive 

growth.  This is especially true at a time when the traditional Phillips curve relationship 

between unemployment and inflation is extremely flat for reasons we do not fully 

understand.  

When we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we often find 

significant and persistent racial disparities.4  For many decades, the unemployment rate 

of African Americans has been nearly double the national unemployment rate, with little 

indication that the relative difference is narrowing or that it can be fully accounted for by 

education or sectoral mix; the unemployment rate for Hispanics also has consistently 

been higher than the national unemployment rate.5  Similarly, during the Great 

Recession, the unemployment rates of African Americans and Hispanics rose more 

sharply and rapidly than for workers as a whole.6  Even though the unemployment rates 

of these groups are back around their pre-recession levels, they remain higher than the 

national average.  We can also see persistent disparities by gender, such as the well-

known wage premium earned by men relative to women with similar experience and 

expertise.7  With its focus on inclusive growth, this Institute could give us important 

insights on how far the overall economy is from full employment, as well as the barriers 

                                                 
4 Board of Governors (2016) discusses some recent trends.  See also Altonji and Blank (1999) and 
references therein for research on racial and gender differences in the labor market.  
5 Cajner and others (2017) find that the higher, more cyclical unemployment of African Americans than 
whites cannot be fully accounted for by differences in education, age, marital status, and state of residence.

(2016).

that could be limiting the economy’s potential, by studying labor market outcomes of 

men and women of different racial and ethnic backgrounds in more depth.8    

Research on the drivers of disparities in labor market outcomes can also help the 

Federal Reserve better assess potential tradeoffs in monetary policy.  In meetings with 

community groups, we often hear from advocates who point to the stark discrepancy they 

see between the economy’s aggregate U-3 unemployment rate, which many forecasters 

estimate to be at or approaching full employment, and the much higher rates of 

unemployment among the people in their neighborhoods.  For instance, Rod Adams, a 

neighborhood advocate here in Minneapolis, noted the unemployment rate for African 

Americans locally was still almost 9 percent late last summer and observed that “if the 

labor market were truly healthy, people in my community would all be able to find full-

time jobs at decent wages.”9  While the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are 

not well suited to addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in the 

labor market outcomes of different groups, understanding these barriers and efforts to 

address them is vital in assessing maximum employment as well as potential growth.   

The Federal Reserve’s community development work is invaluable in supporting 

our efforts to understand and improve the labor market experiences of different groups.10  

For instance, during the Great Recession, workforce development organizations in 

                                                 
8 Aaronson and others (2014) and Barnichon and Mesters (2016) are examples of using details from 
demographic groups to assess overall labor market trends.  In September, the Board of Governors is hosting 
a conference, “Disparities in the Labor Market:  What Are We Missing?’ 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/conferences/disparities-in-the-labor-market-about-2017.htm.

for Popular Democracy for members of the Federal Reserve; a video of the session is available at

Atlanta found themselves overwhelmed by the sharp rise in unemployment, which 

highlighted the need for a better connected and stronger network of job training and 

placement services.  I recently spent time with these organizations, along with 

community members and some of our Atlanta staff, who have been working on the 

creation of the Metro Atlanta eXchange (or MAX) for Workforce Solutions, the region’s 

only comprehensive directory for workforce development services.   

Just as there is a connection between maximum employment and inclusive 

growth, so, too, there is an important connection between potential output and 

opportunity.  If there are large disparities in opportunity based on geography or race or 

gender, such that households’ enterprise, exertion, and investments are not rewarded 

commensurately, then families and small businesses will invest less in the future and 

potential growth will fall short.11  Indeed, one worrisome trend is the decline in the labor 

force participation of prime-age workers with less education, a trend that has been going 

on for decades among men and that has more recently begun to be mirrored in the 

participation rate of women.12  Understanding this growing detachment from work is 

important to improving both opportunity and potential growth.   

In visits to Detroit, Milwaukee, North St. Louis, and Baltimore, I have heard from 

residents and community organizations about the challenging barriers standing between 

the many workers seeking jobs and the many jobs seeking workers.  The local barriers 

separating jobs from job seekers can be as concrete as the physical isolation created by 

major traffic arteries or poorly designed transit systems.13  I have visited Los Angeles, 

                                                 
11 See Marrero and Rodriquez (2013). 
12 See Council of Economic Advisers (2016) and the studies cited therein.

2016 (Detroit and Milwaukee).

where our staff have been actively engaged with businesses, transit authorities, and 

community groups in efforts around “equitable transit-oriented development” so that 

public transit systems are designed to enhance access for low- and moderate-income 

residents.14 

Household Financial Health 

Inclusion and opportunity also figure prominently in our work on financial 

resilience.  While the resilience of the financial system has long been central to Federal 

Reserve policy, in recent years we have come to more fully appreciate that a resilient 

financial system rests on the foundations of financially resilient households and 

businesses. 

The ability to manage the ups and downs in family income and expenses without 

hardship and the ability to make sound investments for the future are both crucial to 

financial health.  Yet we see from the latest edition of the Federal Reserve’s Survey of 

Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) that a strikingly high 40 percent of 

American households with high school degrees or less report that they are struggling 

financially.15 And the in-depth research in the U.S. Financial Diaries Project provides 

insights into the large amount of time and effort these families with thin financial buffers 

must devote to managing their volatile cash flows.16 

A seemingly modest mismatch between income and expenses can threaten to send 

the finances of some families into a downward spiral from which it can be expensive and 

                                                 
14 The information is from community development visits in 2014. 
15 The SHED is an annual survey, representative of the U.S. population, conducted at the Board of 
Governors since 2013.  It is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm. 
16 The U.S. Financial Diaries project, led by Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, is a detailed, 
ethnographic study of financial conditions among low- and moderate-income households.  More 
information is available on the project’s website at www.usfinancialdiaries.org.

difficult to recover.  The results of the 2016 SHED show that nearly one-fourth of all 

households are unable to pay their current month’s bills in full, nearly one-third would 

rely on borrowing or selling something to cover a $400 emergency expense, and one in 

eight would not be able to cover a $400 emergency expense by any means.  Over half of 

households lack savings to cover three months’ expenses if they lost their main source of 

income.17  This finding corroborates the evidence found in the financial diaries of low- to 

moderate-income families that show it is all too common for households to have no short-

term savings to cover emergencies.  According to the Survey of Consumer Finances, on 

average from 1989 to 2013, about 80 percent of households in the bottom quintile of the 

income distribution had less than $3,000 adjusted for inflation in liquid assets (cash, 

checking, or savings accounts).  Even among households in the middle quintile of 

income, about half do not meet this threshold for liquid assets.  

In addition, the financial crisis demonstrated that household financial imbalances 

can have important consequences for overall financial stability in extreme circumstances.  

The rapid and widespread rise in poorly underwritten mortgage debt prior to the Great 

Recession is widely viewed as a key contributor to the financial crisis.18  This suggests 

the potential value of better understanding the specific patterns in household finances that 

would give an early warning of a crisis.  In carrying out our responsibilities to monitor 

and safeguard the stability of the financial system, although much of the work has 

                                                 
17 See Board of Governors (2017). 
18 See, for example, Rajan (2010); Dynan (2012); and Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013) on how high levels of 
mortgage debt may have made the Great Recession more severe and slowed the recovery. While low-
income households were particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the collapse in house prices, rise in 
unemployment, and tightening of credit in the Great Recession, the preceding rise in mortgage debt was 
widespread, also including higher-income households, as documented by Bhutta (2015) and Adelino, 
Schoar, and Severino (2016).

focused on marketwide risks, core financial institutions, and macro-level shocks, we are 

also developing a more granular understanding of the distribution and strength of 

household balance sheets.19  Progress on this frontier is being aided by greater access to 

timely, account-level, and geographically specific data on consumer credit, mortgages, 

and spending, although more research in this area would be valuable.   

Slower income growth, as well as substantial volatility in income, has raised the 

financial stress faced by low- and moderate-income families and may be limiting absolute 

mobility across generations.  Over time, the “American Dream” that each generation can 

expect to be better off than their parents’ generation has gone from being widespread to 

increasingly out of reach for much of the population.20  Researchers have found that the 

reduction in economic mobility has been driven primarily by a more unequal distribution 

of economic growth, with slower overall gross domestic product (GDP) growth a 

secondary factor.21   

Many households had been contending with volatile incomes even before the 

large negative shocks of the Great Recession and the increase in contingent work 

                                                 
19 See, for example, Parker (2014) and Sufi (2014) for useful, research-founded ideas for assessing and 
monitoring the potential for financial fragility among households in the context of the financial system; see 
also Palumbo (forthcoming) for a particular application.  The Quarterly Report on Household Debt and 
Credit from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which draws on its Consumer Credit Panel, is another 
example of new monitoring efforts on household finances in the Federal Reserve System.  More 
information is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s website at 
https://www.newyorkfed.org/microeconomics/hhdc.html. 
20 Chetty and others (2017) estimate that rates of absolute mobility fell from about 90 percent for children 
born in 1940 to 50 percent for children born in the 1980s.  Some research, such as Winship (2017), reaches 
different conclusions on the magnitude of the change, although not on the direction. 
21 Chetty and others (2017) estimate that the slower overall GDP growth experienced by the 1980 birth 
cohort relative to the 1940 birth cohort can account for about 10 percentage points of the decline in 
absolute mobility, while the less equal distribution of income can account for about 30 percentage points of 
the decline.  Commenting on this work, Katz and Krueger (2017) underscore that stagnant growth of 
median household income since the 1970s has been central to the decline in absolute mobility.

arrangements (and the “gig” economy).22 23  Unpredictable income and dangerously low 

emergency savings raise the strain on households and, over time, have pushed them to 

rely on other means, such as borrowing and government transfers, to try to meet their 

spending needs.24  

Education and homeownership have long been key paths to opportunity, but the 

Great Recession has raised some important questions about asset building strategies.  The 

sharp decline in house prices and the substantial rise in student loan debt have made it 

clear that investments in homeownership and education are not without risk, and the 

payoff can vary depending on the circumstances.25 

Homeownership for many has been a way to turn a regular expense into an asset-

building investment in the future, which is especially important given the wide and 

persistent disparities in wealth by race and ethnicity.  But the experience of the past 

decade suggests that owning a home can, in some circumstances, exacerbate financial 

difficulties for vulnerable families in a downturn.  The lesson that even a moderate 

decline in house prices can erase home equity applies broadly, along with the importance 

of sound underwriting and servicing, but the painful consequences in the recession were 

greater among minority and low-income homeowners.26  The fact, discussed earlier, that 

                                                 
22 See Brainard (2016) on the gig economy and the growth of contingent work. 
23 Dynan, Elmendorf, and Sichel (2012) documented a rise in household income volatility from the early 
1970s to late 2008.  In contrast, studies such as Celik and others (2012) do not find a rise in household 
income volatility in the 2000s.  Koo (2016) shows a rise in earnings volatility in the Great Recession.  
Studies of annual income may even understate the volatility, as the financial diaries showed considerable 
month-to-month fluctuations in income among low- and middle-income households. 
24 See Gorbachev (2011). 
25 See Brainard (2015). 
26 Bhutta and Ringo (2015) and the studies discussed therein argue that the Community Reinvestment Act, 
and its encouragement of lending in low- and moderate-income communities, was not a significant 
contributor to the financial crisis. Well-serviced and correctly-structured mortgages performed well for 
low-income borrowers even during a decline in house prices.

African American and Hispanic homeowners households are more likely to lose their 

jobs in a recession and are also more likely to live in neighborhoods with concentrated 

job loss led to even larger house price declines and more foreclosures among these 

households.27  Indeed, there are many low-income neighborhoods in which many 

homeowners remain “underwater” on their mortgages even today.  

Community development organizations are putting this more nuanced view of 

asset building into practice and thereby increasing opportunities for individuals to make 

smart investments in their future.  Better Family Life, a community group I visited in 

North St. Louis, provides would-be homebuyers with education and counseling on how to 

manage the costs of homeownership, tools to navigate real estate markets, and 

information on lending.28  There is ample research demonstrating that housing counseling 

makes a notable improvement in the likelihood that asset building through 

homeownership will pay off for first-time buyers in low- to moderate-income 

communities.29 

Similarly, under the right circumstances, education can be a critical investment in 

the future and a path to opportunity, leading to higher wages and improved financial 

outcomes.  Over the past several decades, the earnings premium for those with a college 

degree relative to those with a high school education has risen substantially, making 

higher education, on average, even more valuable.30   

                                                 
27 See research by Emmons and Noeth (2015) and the related symposium; more information is available on

Nonetheless, even though education is a sound investment for most students, the 

benefits can vary with the quality and type of education received.31  The SHED finds that 

fewer than 40 percent of nongraduates or graduates from for-profit institutions say their 

education was “worth the cost,” compared with two-thirds of graduates from public or 

nonprofit institutions.32  The downsides from such low-return education are compounded 

for those who took out student loans, in some cases leaving them worse off than before.  

As an indication of this problem, nearly three-fourths of recent borrowers who attended 

for-profit schools failed to make progress on paying off their student loans in the first few 

years, and almost half were in default within five years.33  Investments in education that 

do not pay off can set these individuals back on asset building as well as on other life 

goals they may have.  To advance more inclusive growth and opportunity, it is essential 

to help people, especially first-time and nontraditional college students, access smarter 

educational investments with more reliable and better returns.34  

Communities of Opportunity 

The connection between the conditions in a community and individual 

opportunity has been demonstrated in powerful research that many of you have 

pioneered, and we see this connection every day in our work in communities around the 

country. The neighborhood where a family lives can have profound implications for their 

economic opportunities and their children’s prospects.  Families living in neighborhoods 

with high concentrations of poverty and low economic or demographic diversity are more 

                                                 
31 See Brainard (2015).  
32 See Board of Governors (2017). 
33 See Looney and Yannelis (2015). 
34 See Chou, Looney, and Watson (2017) as an example of research on policy tools that could improve 
educational choices.

likely to experience a range of negative outcomes, including exposure to crime and 

violence, physical and mental health problems, and weak academic performance.35  Low-

skilled workers who live far from potential employers or accessible transportation 

networks have more difficulty finding and keeping jobs.36   

These effects of geography on opportunity can stretch from one generation to the 

next.  Raj Chetty and his collaborators have shown that upward mobility varies 

immensely across the country and even within a single metro area.37  Taken together, this 

research underscores the urgency of understanding how we can make communities work 

better for all their members. Since communities play a central role in determining 

opportunity, policy to promote inclusion often focuses on improving local conditions.  

With our presence in communities around the country and our efforts under the 

Community Reinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve is a source of high-quality research 

and region-specific expertise as well as a trusted convener and catalyst on community 

development approaches for lenders, community groups, and local and regional 

governments.   

One important area of focus is housing, which connects families concretely to 

place and can be a source of strength or fragility.  Last year, I met with Milwaukee 

community development groups and residents in one of the more racially segregated 

                                                 
35 In an early evaluation of the Moving to Opportunity program, Katz, Kling, and Liebman (2001) find 
improvements of better neighborhoods on children’s health and safety.  Sampson (2016) summarizes much 
of the recent evidence. 
36 Kain (1968) first advanced the “spatial mismatch” hypothesis.  More recently, Hellerstein, Neumark, and 
McInerney (2008) find evidence for a “spatial-racial mismatch”--namely, that employment among low-
skilled black men depends on proximity to employers who hire black workers.     
37 In one of many studies on opportunity, Chetty and others (2014) use Internal Revenue Service tax return 
data from 40 million adult children to estimate the relative upward mobility across the 741 commuting 
zones (both metro and rural) in the United States.

residential markets in the country.  They highlighted the challenges facing the highly 

insecure rental population in Milwaukee, which were brought alive by Matthew 

Desmond’s careful research.38  Other communities across the nation face similar 

challenges.  In the recently released SHED, we found that among renters who had 

recently moved, 12 percent of African Americans, 16 percent of Hispanics, and 8 percent 

of whites had moved because of eviction or the threat of eviction.39   

The barriers to safe and affordable housing often take on a different form in rural 

areas, where ownership of manufactured housing is often coupled with insecure land 

ownership.  The geographic footprint of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts gives us a 

valuable presence in rural America as well as in towns and cities of all sizes and 

economic fortunes.  Near El Paso, our team has developed important analysis of housing 

challenges in the colonias neighborhoods, where the lack of basic infrastructure and 

costly financing of warranty deeds pose special hurdles for local families.40  We have 

also seen successful models of providing affordable and safe housing when community 

development organizations and financial institutions, along with banks and local 

residents, work together collaboratively.  On a recent visit in El Paso, I saw the value of 

these approaches, as a single mother with significant health challenges received the keys 

to a new home in a stable community, after many long years.  While the densely wooded 

hills and hollers of Eastern Kentucky are a sharp contrast to the desert and floodplain 

expanses of the southwest, the keys to affordable housing in a healthy community can 

bring just as great an improvement in opportunity.  These successes would not be

possible without the ingenuity and collaboration of community development financial 

institutions, local officials, banks, and community members.  As I have witnessed, 

whether it be for a retiree in Helena, Arkansas; a single mom in El Paso, Texas; or a dad 

on disability in Emlyn, Kentucky, the keys to affordable housing in a stable community 

can unlock opportunity for future generations.41 

In some parts of the country, rural residents and small businesses also face 

increasing challenges in accessing financial services as small community banks close and 

larger banks close branches in low-population areas.  Consequently, as I learned from the 

Mayors of Itta Bena and Moorhead, Mississippi, some rural residents, small businesses, 

and even municipalities have to drive long distances to reach a bank.42  In the Mississippi 

Delta, Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) such as HOPE Credit 

Union and Southern Bancorp are acquiring bank branches earmarked for closing in order 

to maintain financial services for some rural communities.43   

Although both pockets of opportunity and of persistent poverty are found in large 

metro and rural areas alike, 44 a greater share of the new jobs and business establishments 

created in the recovery following the Great Recession have been in larger metro areas 

than was the case in previous recoveries.45  In countless communities, especially in rural 

towns and small to midsize cities, we have seen how a deep setback can leave a profound 

and long-lasting mark. These experiences challenge common assumptions about the 

ability of the economy to recover from an economic setback.  This could be the legacy of

concentrated reliance on an industry that experiences decline due to trade or technology 

or the byproduct of lack of connectivity-whether by highways or broadband.  

Technological change, globalization, and other shifts in demand and costs are not new to 

the U.S. economy, but there are troubling signs that less diversified or more isolated 

localities have diminished ability to recover.  And there is increasing evidence that such 

concentrated economic shocks can also lead to severe labor market stress, as well as 

broader consequences for health and mortality.46  Over the past 30 years, the convergence 

in income across regions of the country has slowed dramatically.47   

Even so, some localities fare better than others in establishing new paths to 

opportunity and inclusive growth, and their successes provide actionable lessons.  The 

Boston Fed’s Working Cities Challenge undertook an in depth study of 25 medium-sized 

cities nationwide that had experienced a post-industrial decline and identified 10 that 

experienced an economic resurgence.  The critical determinant of success was the ability 

of leaders in those cities to collaborate across sectors around a long-term vision for 

revitalization.  To encourage such collaboration in other cities, the Boston Fed facilitated 

competitions that reward effective public-private collaboration in developing plans to 

reach community-wide goals.  For example, Holyoke, Massachusetts, proposed a plan to 

simplify the city’s permitting and licensing systems in order to raise the presence of 

Latino-owned businesses.  On economic revitalization, as in other areas of community 

development, effective solutions start with the community setting its own goals, are 

powered by broad collaboration, and rely on evidence to drive results.

Conclusion 

We all have our work cut out for us in helping to understand the state of 

opportunity and inclusion for different groups and communities across our country, and 

ensuring that policy is informed by those important insights.  At the Federal Reserve, we 

will continue to navigate the recovery to ensure we reach and sustain our long-term goals 

of maximum employment and price stability.  We will remain attentive to the financial 

health of vulnerable households.  And we will remain committed to helping illuminate 

the specific challenges faced by low- and moderate-income communities around the 

country and to supporting banks and other financial institutions as they partner in 

strengthening these communities.  In all of these efforts, our work will be greatly 

strengthened by the cutting-edge research and policy insights of the outstanding group 

gathered here tonight.
