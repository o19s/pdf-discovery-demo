Financial stability is integral to achieving the Federal Reserve’s objectives of full 

employment and price stability.  We need only look back a decade to see the dramatic 

damage from financial vulnerabilities that increase unchecked:  Millions of Americans 

lost their livelihoods and their homes, business losses and failures rose, and the 

government had to provide extraordinary support to the system.  Since then, financial 

sector resilience has strengthened, and household balance sheets have been repaired over 

the course of a lengthy recovery.  Today employment is strong, inflation is around target, 

and incomes are growing.1 

If we learned anything from this experience, it is that we must be especially 

vigilant to safeguard the resilience of our financial system in good times when 

vulnerabilities may be building.  That is why the Federal Reserve actively monitors the 

potential vulnerabilities to the financial system.  Last week, for the first time, we released 

our assessment in the Financial Stability Report.2  Today I will offer a brief summary of 

the outlook, highlight areas where I see financial imbalances building, and touch on the 

implications for policy. 

Sustaining the Expansion 

Domestic economic momentum has been strong, as evidenced by the labor 

market.  With the November data, monthly payroll gains have averaged 170,000 over the 

past 3 months, well above the pace necessary to absorb new entrants into the labor force.  

The share of the prime-age population (people ages 25 to 54) that is working is closing in 

on its pre-crisis level.  By most measures, wages have accelerated over the past year and

are now growing around 3 percent, the highest level since the crisis.  These are welcome 

developments.  

While the most recent reading on core personal consumption expenditures, or 

PCE, inflation ticked down, indicators of underlying trend inflation remain encouraging 

overall, providing little signal of an outbreak of inflation to the upside, on the one hand, 

and reassurance that underlying trend inflation may be close to our target of 2 percent, on 

the other (figure 1). 

The economy has grown 3 percent over the past year, and there are good reasons 

to expect growth to remain solid next year, supported by the strong underlying 

momentum in domestic demand.  Consumer spending looks to be robust going into the 

fourth quarter, and ongoing gains in income and employment provide positive 

fundamentals.  In addition, business investment should be solid, even with recent declines 

in oil prices.  Sizable fiscal stimulus has provided an important boost to demand this year 

and will likely contribute somewhat further next year, given the usual lags in outlays and 

in the effects of tax cuts on business and household spending.   

The most likely path for the economy is positive, although some tailwinds that 

have provided a boost are fading, and we may face some crosscurrents.  The global 

growth that provided a strong tailwind going into this year has moderated.  The earlier 

strong growth in Europe and Japan appears to be softening toward trend.  China is 

shifting to an accommodative policy stance to contend with a challenging trade 

environment and lagged effects from its earlier tightening.  Here at home, the impetus to 

growth from fiscal policy is likely to fade going into 2020.  And after being exceptionally 

accommodative, financial conditions have tightened in recent months.  Financial 


 - 3 - 

conditions are still supportive of growth by many measures (figure 2), but less so than 

last year.   

There are risks on both sides of the economy’s likely path.  In Europe, there are 

risks associated with deliberations over Italy’s fiscal and debt trajectory and the United 

Kingdom’s deliberations on the Brexit deal.  Here at home, we hear from businesses that 

the uncertainty associated with trade policy and the implications for supply chains may 

weigh on business capital spending.  Although it is reasonable to expect fiscal spending 

to be extended around current levels in real terms after the Bipartisan Budget Act expires, 

we cannot rule out that fiscal policy could become a headwind in 2020.  

The risks are two-sided.  Business contacts report difficulties finding qualified 

workers and increased costs associated with inputs, tariffs, and transportation, along with 

somewhat greater ability to pass through those increases to consumer prices.  Despite 

this, however, inflation remains muted overall.  At 3.7 percent, the unemployment rate is 

at its lowest level in 49 years, and payrolls have been growing well above the pace that is 

consistent with labor market stabilization.  Historically, the few periods when resource 

utilization has been similarly tight have seen elevated risks of either accelerating inflation 

or financial imbalances. 

Our goal now is to sustain the expansion by maintaining the economy around full 

employment and inflation around target.  The gradual path of increases in the federal 

funds rate has served us well by giving us time to assess the effects of policy as we have 

proceeded.  That approach remains appropriate in the near term, although the policy path 

increasingly will depend on how the outlook evolves.

Assessing Vulnerabilities over the Cycle 

The last several times resource utilization approached levels similar to today, 

signs of overheating showed up in financial-sector imbalances rather than in accelerating 

inflation.  In contrast to the past, the Federal Reserve now has a systematic forward-

looking approach to identifying increases in financial vulnerabilities.  This monitoring is 

the focus of regular Federal Reserve Board and Federal Open Market Committee 

discussions.  Last week, the Board released its first Financial Stability Report to help 

inform the public and promote transparency and accountability as we carry out our 

financial stability responsibilities.   

While there has been substantial progress on reducing household debt burdens 

and increasing the resilience of the banking system, the Federal Reserve’s assessment 

suggests that financial vulnerabilities associated with corporate debt are building against 

a backdrop of elevated risk appetite.  Let me briefly review these developments in turn. 

In contrast to the years preceding the crisis, when household borrowing was 

growing at a pace far above that of gross domestic product (GDP), it has since come 

down and is now growing more slowly than the economy overall (figure 3).  Moreover, 

while much of the increase before the crisis reflected borrowing that proved 

unsustainable, more recent borrowing has been concentrated among households with 

strong credit profiles.    

The regulated financial sector is also more resilient, owing to far-reaching reforms 

as well as favorable conditions.  Large banks have increased both the size and quality of 

their capital buffers:  The ratio of common equity to risk-weighted assets at large banks 

has increased by half relative to the pre-crisis average.  It is now close to levels seen at 


 - 5 - 

smaller banks, although the risk-weighted capital ratio at large banks has moved down 

somewhat over the past year (figure 4).  In addition, insurers appear generally well 

capitalized; broker-dealers, including those not affiliated with large bank holding 

companies, have reduced their leverage; and the outstanding values of funding vehicles 

that embed significant leverage, such as certain securitized products, are much lower.  In 

contrast, there has been some evidence of rising use of leverage by hedge funds over the 

past year and a half. 

Financial reform has reduced funding risks associated with banks and money 

market funds.  Large banks subject to liquidity regulation rely less on unstable short-term 

wholesale funding and have thicker liquidity buffers.  As a result of money market 

reforms, investors have migrated toward government-only funds, which pose low run 

risk, and away from prime institutional funds, which proved highly susceptible to runs 

during the crisis and required extraordinary government support (figure 5). 

In contrast, we are seeing elevated vulnerabilities in the nonfinancial business 

sector.3  Business borrowing has risen more rapidly than GDP for much of the current 

expansion and now sits near its historical peak (figure 6).  The run-up in corporate debt 

has brought the ratio of debt to assets close to its highest level in two decades on an 

overall basis, and this is also true for speculative-grade and unrated firms (figure 7).  And 

whereas previously, mostly high-earning firms with relatively low leverage were taking 

on additional debt, analysis of detailed balance sheet information indicates that, over the 

past year, firms with high leverage, high interest expense ratios, and low earnings and 

                                                 
3 In addition to the discussion of vulnerabilities presented in the Board’s Financial Stability Report, the 
increase in risks associated with nonfinancial corporate borrowing is highlighted in the fall 2018 report 
Semiannual Risk Perspective, produced by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  See Office of the 
Comptroller (2018).

cash holdings have been increasing their debt loads the most.  Historically, high leverage 

has been linked to elevated financial distress and retrenchment by businesses in economic 

downturns. 

Regarding corporate bonds outstanding, recent years have witnessed little change 

in the relative shares of investment-grade bonds and high-yield bonds.  Credit quality has 

deteriorated within the investment-grade segment, where the share of bonds rated at the 

lowest investment-grade level has reached near-record levels.  As of mid-2018, around 35 

percent of corporate bonds outstanding were at the lowest end of the investment-grade 

segment, which amounts to about $2-1/4 trillion.  In comparison, the share of high-yield 

bonds outstanding that are rated “deep junk” has stayed flat at about one-third from 2015 

to 2018, well below the financial crisis peak of 45 percent.   

In an economic downturn, widespread downgrades of these low-rated investment-

grade bonds to speculative-grade ratings could induce some investors to sell them 

rapidly--for instance, because lower-rated bonds have higher regulatory capital 

requirements or because bond funds have limits on the share of non-investment-grade 

bonds they hold.  This concern may be higher now than in the past, since total assets 

under management in bond mutual funds have more than doubled in the past decade to 

about $2.3 trillion this year.  These funds now hold about one-tenth of the corporate bond 

market, and the redemption behavior of investors in these funds during a market 

correction is unclear.  Bond sales could lead to large changes in bond prices and overall 

financial conditions if technological, market, or regulatory factors contribute to strains on 

market liquidity--a possibility that has been relatively untested over the course of the 

expansion. 


 - 7 - 

Further down the credit quality ladder, there has been sizable growth in leveraged 

lending, accompanied by a notable deterioration in underwriting standards.  Net issuance 

of debt to risky borrowers, which had stopped growing in late 2016, rebounded over the 

past year.  Leveraged loans outstanding rose about 12 percent over the past 12 months 

and now stand around $1 trillion overall.4 

 While leveraged loans have traditionally had important investor protections, loan 

covenants for new leveraged loans have weakened dramatically.  Covenant-lite, or cov-

lite, transactions now represent roughly 80 percent of the entire leveraged lending 

market--up from less than 30 percent a decade ago, when they were associated primarily 

with stronger borrowers.  Deals increasingly involve features that increase opacity and 

risk, such as less subordinated debt; “EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, 

depreciation, and amortization) add backs,” which could inflate the projected capacity of 

the borrowers to repay their loans; and “incremental facilities,” which allow additional 

borrowing that is of equal seniority with the existing bank loan.5  The share of newly 

issued large loans to corporations with high leverage (debt to EBITDA ratios above 6) 

now exceeds previous peak levels observed in 2007 and 2014 (figure 8).  Previously, 

much of this deterioration in underwriting appeared to be concentrated among nonbank 

lenders, but this year has witnessed a deterioration in underwriting at the largest banks.  

                                                 
4 Estimates vary.  The estimate of about $1 trillion in the Board’s Financial Stability Report excludes 
lending to financial companies and generally excludes loan commitments by banks.  The S&P Global 
Leveraged Loan Index is around $1.3 trillion.  The estimate of $2.2 trillion in the Bank of England’s 
Financial Stability Report is for the global market, including bank loans. 
5 An “add back” is an unusual, discretionary, or nonrecurring expense that is added back to earnings with 
the intent of normalizing EBITDA.  Examples include legal expenses, insurance costs, or owner-related 
expenses. 


 - 8 - 

The widening adoption of practices that make risk harder to measure suggests a 

heightened focus on industry risk-management practices is warranted.6 

A substantial share of the leveraged loans are packaged in collateralized loan 

obligations (CLOs).  Gross issuance of CLOs hit $71 billion in the first half of 2018.  

This pace represents an increase of about one-third compared with the same period in the 

previous year.7   

Many large banks are engaged in the origination of leveraged loans with an intent 

to distribute, often to CLOs.  The originate-to-distribute model exposes banks to pipeline 

risk--the risk that some originated loans may be difficult to distribute if market conditions 

deteriorate. Although banks have improved pipeline management over the past decade, 

risk-management practices may have weakened somewhat recently in the face of strong 

investor demand.  The direct exposures of the banking system, in the form of loan 

portfolios and warehousing exposures, can be tracked.  But there are also indirect 

exposures, including through bank investments in CLOs on the order of $90 billion, that 

bear vigilance.  More broadly, bank lines to the nonbank financial sector have increased 

notably (figure 9). 

Loan funds have also become increasingly important in the leveraged loan market 

and are estimated to purchase about one-fifth of newly originated leveraged loans.  If 

prices were to move sharply lower, a rush to redeem shares by open-ended mutual fund 

investors could lead to large sales of their relatively illiquid holdings, further 

exacerbating price declines and run incentives.

Bank of England (2018). 


 - 9 - 

To date, the default rate on leveraged loans has been at the low end of its 

historical range, and corporate credit conditions have been favorable, with low interest 

expenses and low expected default rates.  However, if spreads rise sharply or economic 

conditions deteriorate significantly, we could see downgrades, refinancing challenges, 

rising delinquencies and defaults, and losses to investors.  

It is thus particularly notable that the run-up in business debt occurred against a 

backdrop of generally elevated valuations (figure 10).  Even with the recent volatility in 

equity markets and the recent widening of corporate bond spreads, a range of asset prices 

remain high relative to historical benchmarks.  In particular, yields on high-yield 

corporate bonds relative to Treasury securities remain somewhat narrow on a historical 

basis despite recent increases.  Similarly, although they have moved up in recent months, 

spreads on leveraged loans remain in the low end of their range since the financial crisis, 

which is notable given the evidence of weakening protections.  Finally, capitalization 

rates on commercial real estate properties, which measure annual income relative to 

prices for recently transacted properties, have been low relative to Treasury yields.   

The generally high appetite for risk that we saw over the past two years makes the 

equity, corporate debt, and other asset markets more vulnerable to swings in market 

sentiment.  In addition to generating losses for investors, declines in valuations could 

make it more challenging for firms to obtain or extend financing--especially among risky, 

indebted firms--which in turn could be amplified by the high levels of risky corporate 

debt. 


 - 10 - 

Calibrating Policy over the Cycle 

The assessment of financial vulnerabilities that I have outlined naturally raises the 

following question for policymakers:  What is the appropriate risk tolerance?  It goes 

without saying we must take all appropriate steps to prevent another Great Financial 

Crisis from causing the greatest contraction in global economic activity since the Great 

Depression.  But it is also worth remembering that financial imbalances played a key role 

in each of the past three U.S. downturns--the risky investments and maturity mismatches 

associated with the savings and loan crisis and junk bond collapse; the tech boom and 

bust; and, most dramatically, the subprime crisis.  This suggests policy might seek to 

moderate financial vulnerabilities when they are likely to materially exacerbate an 

economic downturn, leading to deeper declines in output and higher levels of 

unemployment. 

Each of the past three U.S. recessions featured important financial imbalances, 

although they differed in important ways.  Both economic theory and econometric 

evidence point to the risk that excesses in corporate debt markets could similarly amplify 

adverse shocks and contribute to job losses.8  The economics are straightforward.  Over-

indebted businesses may face payment strains when earnings fall unexpectedly, and they 

may respond by pulling back on employment and investment.  The slowdown in activity 

lowers investor demand for risky assets, thereby raising spreads and depressing 

valuations.  In turn, business losses accumulate, and delinquencies and defaults rise, 

reducing the willingness or the ability of banks to lend.  This dynamic feeds on itself, 

                                                 
8 For example, López-Salido, Stein, and Zakrajšek (2017) present empirical evidence linking corporate debt 
excesses to contractions in U.S. economic activity and review related research.

potentially amplifying moderate adverse shocks into more serious financial strains or a 

recession.9 

Given the risks to the financial system and economy from this potential adverse 

feedback loop, a strong case can be made that the financial system’s buffers should be 

fortified when the economy is strong.  Reinforcing capital buffers during the strong part 

of the cycle means that banks will have a cushion to absorb losses and remain sound 

during a subsequent downturn.  Thicker capital buffers help bolster the confidence of 

market participants when conditions deteriorate, helping prevent the downward spiral 

from a loss of confidence.  And during the downturn, that extra buffer can be released to 

enable banks to continue lending and help mitigate its severity.  History suggests that we 

should not expect the market to provide incentives for banks to build the necessary 

buffers when times are good; the essence of the cycle is that market sentiment become 

overconfident precisely when risk is actually highest.  One of the roles for independent 

regulatory bodies such as the Federal Reserve is to serve as a counterweight.  Moreover, 

as we saw in the last crisis, it is much costlier to rebuild capital in a downturn when 

earnings and risk appetite are low than to build buffers in an expansion when earnings are 

strong. 

At the Federal Reserve, the two important tools that can respond somewhat to 

rising vulnerabilities are the design of stress-test scenarios and the countercyclical capital 

buffer (CCyB).  The annual supervisory stress test examines the resilience of large bank 

holding companies to a severely adverse scenario, which includes salient risks that can be 

                                                 
9 The broad contours of this dynamic are laid out theoretically in the literature on the financial accelerator.  
The classic reference is Bernanke and Gertler (1989). 


 - 12 - 

adjusted over time.  In recent years, the scenarios have been designed to explore severe 

dislocations in corporate credit markets as a salient risk.   

Nonetheless, the stress tests have limitations as a countercyclical tool during 

buoyant periods.  For instance, while the severity of the stresses can be varied from year 

to year to address emerging risks to some degree, it is difficult to introduce entirely new 

scenarios each year to target specific sectoral risks without introducing excessive 

complexity.10  And while the stress tests and proposed stress capital buffer are designed 

to calibrate capital buffers for the riskiness of an institution’s particular assets and 

exposures, the capital buffer does not vary systematically to counter the cyclicality that 

arises through elevated asset valuations and other channels.11  The limited ability of the 

stress tests to increase loss-absorbing capacity during buoyant economic times is 

illustrated in the results from recent years, where scenarios have involved increasingly 

severe recessions and strains in corporate debt markets but generally lower declines in 

capital ratios.  More broadly, capital ratios at the largest banks have been flat and, more 

recently, modestly lower. 

In contrast, the first goal of the CCyB is to directly build resilience at large bank 

holding companies when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often 

follow periods of credit growth or rapid asset price appreciation.  The second goal of the 

CCyB is to promote a more sustainable supply of credit over the economic cycle.  The 

CCyB is expected to be reduced as credit growth slows in order to support credit supply 

at times when it might otherwise contract.  As a rough rule of thumb, the criteria for

(2013).

implementing the CCyB described in the Board’s framework of September 2016 are 

calibrated so that the CCyB will be above its minimum value of zero about one-third of 

the time--when financial vulnerabilities are assessed to be in the upper one-third of their 

historical distribution.12   

There are several potential advantages to building additional resilience through 

the CCyB.  First, countercyclical capital requirements are intended to lean against rising 

risks at a time when the degree of monetary tightening needed to achieve the same goal 

could be inconsistent with sustaining the expansion.  And countercyclical capital 

requirements build resilience, unlike monetary policy.  Second, the banks that are subject 

to the CCyB could achieve a modest buffer simply by safeguarding the capital they have 

built up or by reducing payouts moderately.  Third, the CCyB is a simple, predictable, 

and slow-moving tool that applies equally across all large banks.  It does not single out 

shortfalls in particular banks or result in hard-to-predict volatility in individual banks’ 

stressed capital requirements.  Finally and critically, the additional capital implied by the 

CCyB across the system can be released when conditions deteriorate to ensure the ability 

of large banks to lend into a downturn.  A number of countries have raised their CCyB 

setting above zero, and we can learn from their experiences, which have generally been 

positive.13   

Conclusion 

Our job now is to sustain the expansion by maintaining the economy around full 

employment and inflation near target.  Recent history suggests that the business cycle and

the financial cycle are increasingly intertwined.  If history is any guide, as resource 

utilization continues to tighten, there is some risk that financial imbalances could grow.  

The U.S. financial system is much more resilient than before the crisis, owing 

importantly to strong financial reforms.  Even so, the banking system’s core capital and 

liquidity buffers have yet to be tested through a full cycle.  At the same time, the appetite 

for risk among financial market participants rose notably over 2017 and much of 2018, 

and corporate borrowing has reached new heights amid rapid growth and deteriorating 

underwriting standards in riskier segments, such as leveraged lending.  The mutual funds 

that have built up exposure to some of this risky debt have liquidity mismatches that 

could contribute to market dislocations in stressed conditions.  This constellation of 

vulnerabilities could amplify adverse shocks that might materialize.  At a time when 

cyclical pressures have been building and bank profitability has been strong, it might be 

prudent to ask large banking organizations to fortify their capital buffers, which could 

subsequently be released if conditions warrant.
