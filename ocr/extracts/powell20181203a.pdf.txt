Thank you, Anna.  It’s an honor to be part of this important occasion.  Tonight is an 

opportunity to recognize the vital contributions of the Federal Reserve’s community 

development staff, and an opportunity to honor Chair Yellen, who did so much to advance the 

Fed’s community development mission.  

Briefly, I would like to focus on the importance of promoting a strong economy that 

extends opportunity to all and on the role our community development staff plays to advance that 

goal. 

The Federal Reserve’s mission is to promote a strong economy and sound financial 

system; I am glad to say we have made a great deal of progress toward those goals.  

Unemployment is 3.7 percent, the lowest in nearly half a century.  Over 17 million jobs have 

been created during this expansion, with an additional 250,000 created in October. 

Beyond the labor market, there are other signs of economic strength.  The steady decline 

in the unemployment rate is mirrored by the decline in financial hardship reported by 

respondents to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking over 

the past five years.1  Wage gains, increased household wealth, and elevated consumer confidence 

are supporting robust consumer spending.  Since the crisis, we have also taken numerous steps to 

make the financial system safer and stronger, leaving it better equipped to support the financial 

needs of consumers and communities through good times and bad.2

However, the benefits of this strong economy and sound financial system have not 

reached all Americans.  The aggregate statistics tend to mask important disparities by income, 

race, and geography. 

Moreover, the economy faces a number of longer-term challenges.3  While there have 

been gains in the pace of wage growth recently, wages for lower-income workers have grown 

quite slowly over the past few decades.  Productivity has picked up in recent months after several 

years of very slow growth, but it is not clear whether this is a trend that will be sustained.  An 

aging population is limiting growth in labor supply, which in turn limits potential growth.  And a 

decades-long decline in economic mobility in the United States reflects the difficulty faced by 

lower-income Americans in moving up the economic ladder.4  

The Fed’s community development function plays a key role in helping us carry out our 

broad responsibilities.  Information gathered by the community development staff ensures that 

the perspectives of individuals and communities inform the Fed’s research, policy, and actions.  

Soliciting diverse views on issues affecting the economy and financial markets improves the 

quality of our research, the fairness of our policies, and the transparency of our actions.  Raising 

awareness of emerging economic trends and risks makes regulation and supervision more 

responsive to evolving consumer financial services markets and technologies.  The Fed’s 

community development function also advances our Community Reinvestment Act

responsibilities by analyzing and disseminating information related to local financial needs and 

successful approaches for attracting and deploying capital.  These efforts strengthen the capacity 

of both financial institutions and community organizations to meet the needs of the communities 

they serve. 

In addition to providing us with a richer, more nuanced understanding of current 

economic and financial conditions, the Federal Reserve’s community development staff is deeply 

engaged in helping lower-income and underserved communities overcome their challenges and 

capitalize on their assets.  One thing that was apparent during the recession and the uneven 

recovery that followed was that people and the places they live are linked.  When one struggles, 

both struggle.  Successful community development invests in and builds up both the physical 

infrastructure and human capital in underserved areas.  The Federal Reserve is uniquely 

positioned to bring together diverse stakeholders to disseminate information, exchange ideas, and 

identify shared interests that foster local partnerships and comprehensive solutions. 

This event is an opportunity to recognize your efforts to advance solutions that build 

resilient and more prosperous communities.  I want to thank Ariel Cisneros--our distinguished 

inaugural recipient of the Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development--as well as 

each of you for your individual and collective service to this effort. 

And speaking of service:  It is fitting that this award for excellence in community 

development will today and thenceforth be given in honor of Janet Yellen.  During your tenure 

as Chair, Janet, you elevated the importance of economic and financial inclusion and the Fed’s 

role in community development.  You reminded us that an inclusive economy is a vibrant 

economy.  Governor Brainard, the principal oversight governor for community development, and

I are honored to carry this message forward.  The economy benefits when we successfully tap 

into the underutilized potential of more of our fellow Americans.5  

Thank you, Janet, for everything that you accomplished as Chair and over a lifetime of 

public service that thankfully continues today.  And congratulations, Ariel, for what you have 

accomplished in service to others, which has made you such a deserving recipient of this award.
