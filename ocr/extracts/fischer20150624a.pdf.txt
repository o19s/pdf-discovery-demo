It’s a pleasure to take part in the Riksbank Macroprudential Conference and I thank the 

organizers for inviting me to participate in the conference, and particularly in this panel on stress 

testing. 

Stress testing has become a cornerstone of a new approach to regulation and supervision 

of the largest financial institutions in the United States.  The Federal Reserve’s first supervisory 

stress test was the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, known as the SCAP.  Conducted in 

2009 during the depths of the financial crisis, the SCAP marked the first time the U.S. bank 

regulatory agencies had conducted a supervisory stress test simultaneously across the largest 

banking firms.  The results clearly demonstrated the value of simultaneous, forward-looking 

supervisory assessments of capital adequacy under stressed conditions.  The SCAP was also a 

key contributor to the relatively rapid restoration of the financial health of the U.S. banking 

system. 

The Fed’s approach to stress testing of the largest and most systemic financial institutions 

has evolved since the SCAP, but several key elements persist to this day.1  These elements 

include, first, supervisory stress scenarios applicable to all firms; second, defined consequences 

for firms deemed to be insufficiently capitalized; and third, public disclosure of the results.  

The Fed has subsequently conducted five stress test exercises that built on the success of 

SCAP, while making some important improvements to the stress test processes.  The first key 

innovation was the development of supervisory models and processes that allow the Fed to 

evaluate independently whether banks are sufficiently resilient to continue to lend to consumers 

and to businesses under adverse economic and financial conditions.  This innovation took place 

                                                           
1 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Fed to conduct a supervisory stress test for bank holding companies with $50 
billion or more in total consolidated assets, and for nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for Fed supervision.

over the course of several exercises and was made possible by the extensive collection of data 

from the banks.  These data have allowed supervisors to build models that are more sensitive to 

stress scenarios and better define the riskiness of the firms’ different businesses and exposures.   

The second innovation since the SCAP was the use of the supervisory stress test as a key 

input into the annual supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy at the largest bank holding 

companies.  The crisis demonstrated the importance of forward-looking supervision that 

accounted for the possibility of negative outcomes.  By focusing on forward-looking post-stress 

capital ratios, stress testing provides an assessment of a firm’s capital adequacy that is 

complementary to regulatory capital ratios, which reflect the firm’s performance to date.  

Although we view this new approach to capital assessment as a significant improvement over 

previous practices, we are aware that the true test of this new regime will come only if another 

period of significant financial or economic stress were to materialize--which is to say that we 

will not have a strong test of the effectiveness of stress testing until the stress tests undergo a real 

world stress test.  The same comment, mutatis mutandis, applies to the overall changes in 

methods of bank regulation and supervision made since September 15, 2008. 

Third, supervisory stress testing has been on the leading edge of a movement toward 

greater supervisory transparency.  Since the SCAP, the Fed has steadily increased the 

transparency around its stress testing processes, methodologies, and results.  Before the crisis, 

releasing unfavorable supervisory information about particular firms was unthinkable--for fear of 

setting off runs on banks.  However, the release of the SCAP results helped to calm markets 

during the crisis by reducing uncertainty about firm solvency.  Indeed, only one of the 10 firms 

deemed to have a capital shortfall was unable to close the identified gap on the private markets.  

Our experience to date has been that transparency around the stress testing exercise improves the

credibility of the exercise and creates accountability both for firms and supervisors.  That said, 

too much transparency can also have potentially negative consequences, an idea to which I will 

turn shortly. 

With the benefit of five years of experience, the Fed is continuing to assess its stress 

testing program, and to make appropriate changes.  Examples of such changes to date include the 

assumption of default by each firm’s largest counterparty and the assumption that firms would 

not curtail lending to consumers and businesses, even under severely adverse conditions.  As part 

of that assessment process, we are also currently seeking feedback from the industry, market 

analysts, and academics about the program.   

Supervisory stress testing is not a static exercise and must adapt to a changing economic 

and financial environment and must incorporate innovations in modeling technology.  Work is 

currently underway on adapting the stress testing framework to accommodate firms that have not 

traditionally been subject to these tests.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Fed to conduct stress 

tests on non-bank financial institutions that have been designated as systemically important by 

the FSOC--the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Three of the currently designated financial 

institutions are global insurance companies.  While distress at these firms poses risks to financial 

stability, particularly during a stressful period, certain sources of risk to these firms are distinct 

from the risks banking organizations face.  A key aspect of this ongoing work includes adapting 

our current stress testing framework and scenarios to ensure that the tests for non-bank SIFIs--

systemically important financial institutions--are appropriate.  

Another area where work continues--and will likely always continue--is the Fed’s 

ongoing research aimed at improving our ability to estimate losses and revenues under stress.  

Supervisors have both to develop new approaches that push the state of the art in stress testing 


- 4 - 
 


and to respond as new modeling techniques are developed or as firm activities and risk 

concentrations evolve over time.  For example, forecasting how a particular bank’s revenue may 

respond to a severe macroeconomic recession can be challenging, and we continue to seek ways 

to enhance our ability to do so. 

Supervisory stress testing models and methodologies have to evolve over time in order to 

better capture salient emerging risks to financial firms and the system as a whole.  However, the 

framework cannot simply be expanded to include more and more aspects of reality.  For 

example, incorporating feedback from financial system distress to the real economy is a complex 

and difficult modelling challenge.  Whether we recognize it or not, the standard solution to a 

complex modeling challenge is to simplify--typically to the minimum extent possible--aspects of 

the overall modelling framework.  However, incorporating feedback into the stress test 

framework may require simplifying aspects of the framework to a point where it is less able to 

capture the risks to individual institutions.  Even so, one can imagine substantial gains from 

continued research on stress testing’s role in macroprudential supervision and our understanding 

of risks to the financial system, such as knock-on effects, contagion, fire sales, and the 

interaction between capital and liquidity during a crisis.  

Finally, let me close by addressing a question that often arises about the use of a 

supervisory stress test, such as those conducted by the Fed, with common scenarios and models.  

Such a test may create the possibility of, in former Chairman Bernanke’s words, a “model 

monoculture,” in which all models are similar and all miss the same key risks.2  Such a culture 

could possibly create vulnerabilities in the financial system.  At the Fed we try to address this

issue, in part, through appropriate disclosure about the supervisory stress test.  We have 

published information about the overall framework employed in various aspects of the 

supervisory stress test, but not the full details that banks could use to manage to the test.  

This--making it easier to game the test--is the potential negative consequence of transparency 

that I alluded to earlier. 

We also value different approaches for designing scenarios and conducting stress tests.  

In the United States, in addition to supervisory stress testing, large financial firms are required to 

conduct their own stress tests, using their own models and stress scenarios that capture their 

unique risks.3  In evaluating each bank’s capital planning process, supervisors focus on how well 

banks’ internal scenarios and models capture their unique risks and business models.  We expect 

firms to determine the risks inherent to their businesses, their risk-appetite, and to make business 

decisions on that basis.  

And that is a good place to stop.   

Thank you. 

                                                           
3 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, all financial companies with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets that are 
supervised by a primary federal financial regulatory agency are required to conduct an annual company-run stress 
test.  However, only bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets are subject to the 
supervisory stress test and an evaluation of their capital planning process.
