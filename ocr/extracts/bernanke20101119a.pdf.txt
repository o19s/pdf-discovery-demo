Rebalancing the Global Recovery 


Remarks by 

Ben S. Bernanke 

Chairman 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

Sixth European Central Bank Central Banking Conference 

Frankfurt, Germany 




November 19, 2010 



The global economy is now well into its second year of recovery from the deep 

recession triggered by the most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression.  In 

the most intense phase of the crisis, as a financial conflagration threatened to engulf the 

global economy, policymakers in both advanced and emerging market economies found 

themselves confronting common challenges.  Amid this shared sense of urgency, national 

policy responses were forceful, timely, and mutually reinforcing.  This policy 

collaboration was essential in averting a much deeper global economic contraction and 

providing a foundation for renewed stability and growth.   

In recent months, however, that sense of common purpose has waned.  Tensions 

among nations over economic policies have emerged and intensified, potentially 

threatening our ability to find global solutions to global problems.  One source of these 

tensions has been the bifurcated nature of the global economic recovery:  Some 

economies have fully recouped their losses while others have lagged behind.  But at a 

deeper level, the tensions arise from the lack of an agreed-upon framework to ensure that 

national policies take appropriate account of interdependencies across countries and the 

interests of the international system as a whole.  Accordingly, the essential challenge for 

policymakers around the world is to work together to achieve a mutually beneficial 

outcome--namely, a robust global economic expansion that is balanced, sustainable, and 

less prone to crises.   

The Two-Speed Global Recovery 

International policy cooperation is especially difficult now because of the two-

speed nature of the global recovery.  Specifically, as shown in figure 1, since the recovery 

began, economic growth in the emerging market economies (the dashed blue line) has far 


- 2 - 
 


outstripped growth in the advanced economies (the solid red line).  These differences are 

partially attributable to longer-term differences in growth potential between the two 

groups of countries, but to a significant extent they also reflect the relatively weak pace 

of recovery thus far in the advanced economies.  This point is illustrated by figure 2, 

which shows the levels, as opposed to the growth rates, of real gross domestic product 

(GDP) for the two groups of countries.  As you can see, generally speaking, output in the 

advanced economies has not returned to the levels prevailing before the crisis, and real 

GDP in these economies remains far below the levels implied by pre-crisis trends.  In 

contrast, economic activity in the emerging market economies has not only fully made up 

the losses induced by the global recession, but is also rapidly approaching its pre-crisis 

trend.  To cite some illustrative numbers, if we were to extend forward from the end of 

2007 the 10-year trends in output for the two groups of countries, we would find that the 

level of output in the advanced economies is currently about 8 percent below its longer-

term trend, whereas economic activity in the emerging markets is only about 1-1/2 

percent below the corresponding (but much steeper) trend line for that group of countries.  

Indeed, for some emerging market economies, the crisis appears to have left little lasting 

imprint on growth.  Notably, since the beginning of 2005, real output has risen more than 

70 percent in China and about 55 percent in India.  

In the United States, the recession officially ended in mid-2009, and--as shown in 

figure 3--real GDP growth was reasonably strong in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the 

first quarter of this year.  However, much of that growth appears to have stemmed from 

transitory factors, including inventory adjustments and fiscal stimulus.  Since the second 

quarter of this year, GDP growth has moderated to around 2 percent at an annual rate, 


- 3 - 
 


less than the Federal Reserve’s estimates of U.S. potential growth and insufficient to 

meaningfully reduce unemployment.  And indeed, as figure 4 shows, the U.S. 

unemployment rate (the solid black line) has stagnated for about eighteen months near 10 

percent of the labor force, up from about 5 percent before the crisis; the increase of 5 

percentage points in the U.S. unemployment rate is roughly double that seen in the euro 

area, the United Kingdom, Japan, or Canada.  Of some 8.4 million U.S. jobs lost between 

the peak of the expansion and the end of 2009, only about 900,000 have been restored 

thus far.  Of course, the jobs gap is presumably even larger if one takes into account the 

natural increase in the size of the working age population over the past three years.   

Of particular concern is the substantial increase in the share of unemployed 

workers who have been without work for six months or more (the dashed red line in 

figure 4).  Long-term unemployment not only imposes extreme hardship on jobless 

people and their families, but, by eroding these workers’ skills and weakening their 

attachment to the labor force, it may also convert what might otherwise be temporary 

cyclical unemployment into much more intractable long-term structural unemployment.  

In addition, persistently high unemployment, through its adverse effects on household 

income and confidence, could threaten the strength and sustainability of the recovery. 

Low rates of resource utilization in the United States are creating disinflationary 

pressures.  As shown in figure 5, various measures of underlying inflation have been 

trending downward and are currently around 1 percent, which is below the rate of 

2 percent or a bit less that most Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants 

judge as being most consistent with the Federal Reserve’s policy objectives in the long

run.1

Monetary Policy in the United States 

  With inflation expectations stable, and with levels of resource slack expected to 

remain high, inflation trends are expected to be quite subdued for some time. 

Because the genesis of the financial crisis was in the United States and other 

advanced economies, the much weaker recovery in those economies compared with that 

in the emerging markets may not be entirely unexpected (although, given their traditional 

vulnerability to crises, the resilience of the emerging market economies over the past few 

years is both notable and encouraging).  What is clear is that the different cyclical 

positions of the advanced and emerging market economies call for different policy 

settings.  Although the details of the outlook vary among jurisdictions, most advanced 

economies still need accommodative policies to continue to lay the groundwork for a 

strong, durable recovery.  Insufficiently supportive policies in the advanced economies 

could undermine the recovery not only in those economies, but for the world as a whole.  

In contrast, emerging market economies increasingly face the challenge of maintaining 

robust growth while avoiding overheating, which may in some cases involve the 

measured withdrawal of policy stimulus. 

Let me address the case of the United States specifically.  As I described, the U.S. 

unemployment rate is high and, given the slow pace of economic growth, likely to remain 

so for some time.  Indeed, although I expect that growth will pick up and unemployment 

will decline somewhat next year, we cannot rule out the possibility that unemployment 

might rise further in the near term, creating added risks for the recovery.  Inflation has 

                                                           
1 Figure 5 shows core and trimmed-mean measures to better display the decline in underlying, or trend, 
inflation.  Total inflation measures have been volatile in recent years but are currently a bit above 1 percent 
on a 12-month basis.  Projections by FOMC participants have indicated that, under appropriate monetary 
policies, inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures should converge 
to 2 percent or a bit less in the long run.

declined noticeably since the business cycle peak, and further disinflation could hinder 

the recovery.  In particular, with shorter-term nominal interest rates close to zero, 

declines in actual and expected inflation imply both higher realized and expected real 

interest rates, creating further drags on growth.2

The Federal Reserve’s policy target for the federal funds rate has been near zero 

since December 2008, so another means of providing monetary accommodation has been 

necessary since that time.  Accordingly, the FOMC purchased Treasury and agency-

backed securities on a large scale from December 2008 through March 2010, a policy 

that appears to have been quite successful in helping to stabilize the economy and support 

the recovery during that period.  Following up on this earlier success, the Committee 

announced this month that it would purchase additional Treasury securities.  In taking 

that action, the Committee seeks to support the economic recovery, promote a faster pace 

of job creation, and reduce the risk of a further decline in inflation that would prove 

damaging to the recovery. 

  In light of the significant risks to the 

economic recovery, to the health of the labor market, and to price stability, the FOMC 

decided that additional policy support was warranted.   

Although securities purchases are a different tool for conducting monetary policy 

than the more familiar approach of managing the overnight interest rate, the goals and 

transmission mechanisms are very similar.  In particular, securities purchases by the 

central bank affect the economy primarily by lowering interest rates on securities of 

longer maturities, just as conventional monetary policy, by affecting the expected path of 

short-term rates, also influences longer-term rates.  Lower longer-term rates in turn lead 

                                                           
2 Unexpectedly high realizations of real interest rates increase the real burden of household and business 
debts, relative to what was anticipated when the debt contracts were signed.  Higher expected real interest 
rates deter capital investment and other forms of spending. 


- 6 - 
 


to more accommodative financial conditions, which support household and business 

spending.  As I noted, the evidence suggests that asset purchases can be an effective tool; 

indeed, financial conditions eased notably in anticipation of the Federal Reserve’s policy 

announcement. 

Incidentally, in my view, the use of the term “quantitative easing” to refer to the 

Federal Reserve’s policies is inappropriate.  Quantitative easing typically refers to 

policies that seek to have effects by changing the quantity of bank reserves, a channel 

which seems relatively weak, at least in the U.S. context.  In contrast, securities 

purchases work by affecting the yields on the acquired securities and, via substitution 

effects in investors’ portfolios, on a wider range of assets. 

This policy tool will be used in a manner that is measured and responsive to 

economic conditions.  In particular, the Committee stated that it would review its asset-

purchase program regularly in light of incoming information and would adjust the 

program as needed to meet its objectives.  Importantly, the Committee remains 

unwaveringly committed to price stability and does not seek inflation above the level of 2 

percent or a bit less that most FOMC participants see as consistent with the Federal 

Reserve’s mandate.  In that regard, it bears emphasizing that the Federal Reserve has 

worked hard to ensure that it will not have any problems exiting from this program at the 

appropriate time.  The Fed’s power to pay interest on banks’ reserves held at the Federal 

Reserve will allow it to manage short-term interest rates effectively and thus to tighten 

policy when needed, even if bank reserves remain high.  Moreover, the Fed has invested 

considerable effort in developing tools that will allow it to drain or immobilize bank 

reserves as needed to facilitate the smooth withdrawal of policy accommodation when 


- 7 - 
 


conditions warrant.  If necessary, the Committee could also tighten policy by redeeming 

or selling securities. 

The foreign exchange value of the dollar has fluctuated considerably during the 

course of the crisis, driven by a range of factors.  A significant portion of these 

fluctuations has reflected changes in investor risk aversion, with the dollar tending to 

appreciate when risk aversion is high.  In particular, much of the decline over the summer 

in the foreign exchange value of the dollar reflected an unwinding of the increase in the 

dollar’s value in the spring associated with the European sovereign debt crisis.  The 

dollar’s role as a safe haven during periods of market stress stems in no small part from 

the underlying strength and stability that the U.S. economy has exhibited over the years.  

Fully aware of the important role that the dollar plays in the international monetary and 

financial system, the Committee believes that the best way to continue to deliver the 

strong economic fundamentals that underpin the value of the dollar, as well as to support 

the global recovery, is through policies that lead to a resumption of robust growth in a 

context of price stability in the United States. 

In sum, on its current economic trajectory the United States runs the risk of seeing 

millions of workers unemployed or underemployed for many years.  As a society, we 

should find that outcome unacceptable.  Monetary policy is working in support of both 

economic recovery and price stability, but there are limits to what can be achieved by the 

central bank alone.  The Federal Reserve is nonpartisan and does not make 

recommendations regarding specific tax and spending programs.  However, in general 

terms, a fiscal program that combines near-term measures to enhance growth with strong, 


- 8 - 
 


confidence-inducing steps to reduce longer-term structural deficits would be an important 

complement to the policies of the Federal Reserve. 

Global Policy Challenges and Tensions 

The two-speed nature of the global recovery implies that different policy stances 

are appropriate for different groups of countries.  As I have noted, advanced economies 

generally need accommodative policies to sustain economic growth.  In the emerging 

market economies, by contrast, strong growth and incipient concerns about inflation have 

led to somewhat tighter policies. 

Unfortunately, the differences in the cyclical positions and policy stances of the 

advanced and emerging market economies have intensified the challenges for 

policymakers around the globe.  Notably, in recent months, some officials in emerging 

market economies and elsewhere have argued that accommodative monetary policies in 

the advanced economies, especially the United States, have been producing negative 

spillover effects on their economies.  In particular, they are concerned that advanced 

economy policies are inducing excessive capital inflows to the emerging market 

economies, inflows that in turn put unwelcome upward pressure on emerging market 

currencies and threaten to create asset price bubbles.  As is evident in figure 6, net private 

capital flows to a selection of emerging market economies (based on national balance of 

payments data) have rebounded from the large outflows experienced during the worst of 

the crisis.  Overall, by this broad measure, such inflows through the second quarter of this 

year were not any larger than in the year before the crisis, but they were nonetheless 

substantial.  A narrower but timelier measure of demand for emerging market assets--net 

inflows to equity and bond funds investing in emerging markets, shown in figure 7--


- 9 - 
 


suggests that inflows of capital to emerging market economies have indeed picked up in 

recent months.  

To a large degree, these capital flows have been driven by perceived return 

differentials that favor emerging markets, resulting from factors such as stronger 

expected growth--both in the short term and in the longer run--and higher interest rates, 

which reflect differences in policy settings as well as other forces.  As figures 6 and 7 

show, even before the crisis, fast-growing emerging market economies were attractive 

destinations for cross-border investment.  However, beyond these fundamental factors, an 

important driver of the rapid capital inflows to some emerging markets is incomplete 

adjustment of exchange rates in those economies, which leads investors to anticipate 

additional returns arising from expected exchange rate appreciation. 

The exchange rate adjustment is incomplete, in part, because the authorities in 

some emerging market economies have intervened in foreign exchange markets to 

prevent or slow the appreciation of their currencies.  The degree of intervention is 

illustrated for selected emerging market economies in figure 8.  The vertical axis of this 

graph shows the percent change in the real effective exchange rate in the 12 months 

through September.  The horizontal axis shows the accumulation of foreign exchange 

reserves as a share of GDP over the same period.  The relationship evident in the graph 

suggests that the economies that have most heavily intervened in foreign exchange 

markets have succeeded in limiting the appreciation of their currencies.  The graph also 

illustrates that some emerging market economies have intervened at very high levels and 

others relatively little.  Judging from the changes in the real effective exchange rate, the 

emerging market economies that have largely let market forces determine their exchange 


- 10 - 
 


rates have seen their competitiveness reduced relative to those emerging market 

economies that have intervened more aggressively. 

It is striking that, amid all the concerns about renewed private capital inflows to 

the emerging market economies, total capital, on net, is still flowing from relatively 

labor-abundant emerging market economies to capital-abundant advanced economies.  In 

particular, the current account deficit of the United States implies that it experienced net 

capital inflows exceeding 3 percent of GDP in the first half of this year.  A key driver of 

this “uphill” flow of capital is official reserve accumulation in the emerging market 

economies that exceeds private capital inflows to these economies.  The total holdings of 

foreign exchange reserves by selected major emerging market economies, shown in 

figure 9, have risen sharply since the crisis and now surpass $5 trillion--about six times 

their level a decade ago.  China holds about half of the total reserves of these selected 

economies, slightly more than $2.6 trillion. 

It is instructive to contrast this situation with what would happen in an 

international system in which exchange rates were allowed to fully reflect market 

fundamentals.  In the current context, advanced economies would pursue accommodative 

monetary policies as needed to foster recovery and to guard against unwanted 

disinflation.  At the same time, emerging market economies would tighten their own 

monetary policies to the degree needed to prevent overheating and inflation.  The 

resulting increase in emerging market interest rates relative to those in the advanced 

economies would naturally lead to increased capital flows from advanced to emerging 

economies and, consequently, to currency appreciation in emerging market economies.  

This currency appreciation would in turn tend to reduce net exports and current account 


- 11 - 
 


surpluses in the emerging markets, thus helping cool these rapidly growing economies 

while adding to demand in the advanced economies.  Moreover, currency appreciation 

would help shift a greater proportion of domestic output toward satisfying domestic needs 

in emerging markets.  The net result would be more balanced and sustainable global 

economic growth.   

Given these advantages of a system of market-determined exchange rates, why 

have officials in many emerging markets leaned against appreciation of their currencies 

toward levels more consistent with market fundamentals?  The principal answer is that 

currency undervaluation on the part of some countries has been part of a long-term 

export-led strategy for growth and development.  This strategy, which allows a country’s 

producers to operate at a greater scale and to produce a more diverse set of products than 

domestic demand alone might sustain, has been viewed as promoting economic growth 

and, more broadly, as making an important contribution to the development of a number 

of countries.  However, increasingly over time, the strategy of currency undervaluation 

has demonstrated important drawbacks, both for the world system and for the countries 

using that strategy. 

First, as I have described, currency undervaluation inhibits necessary 

macroeconomic adjustments and creates challenges for policymakers in both advanced 

and emerging market economies.  Globally, both growth and trade are unbalanced, as 

reflected in the two-speed recovery and in persistent current account surpluses and 

deficits.  Neither situation is sustainable.  Because a strong expansion in the emerging 

market economies will ultimately depend on a recovery in the more advanced economies, 

this pattern of two-speed growth might very well be resolved in favor of slow growth for 


- 12 - 
 


everyone if the recovery in the advanced economies falls short.  Likewise, large and 

persistent imbalances in current accounts represent a growing financial and economic 

risk. 

Second, the current system leads to uneven burdens of adjustment among 

countries, with those countries that allow substantial flexibility in their exchange rates 

bearing the greatest burden (for example, in having to make potentially large and rapid 

adjustments in the scale of export-oriented industries) and those that resist appreciation 

bearing the least. 

Third, countries that maintain undervalued currencies may themselves face 

important costs at the national level, including a reduced ability to use independent 

monetary policies to stabilize their economies and the risks associated with excessive or 

volatile capital inflows.  The latter can be managed to some extent with a variety of tools, 

including various forms of capital controls, but such approaches can be difficult to 

implement or lead to microeconomic distortions.  The high levels of reserves associated 

with currency undervaluation may also imply significant fiscal costs if the liabilities 

issued to sterilize reserves bear interest rates that exceed those on the reserve assets 

themselves.  Perhaps most important, the ultimate purpose of economic growth is to 

deliver higher living standards at home; thus, eventually, the benefits of shifting 

productive resources to satisfying domestic needs must outweigh the development 

benefits of continued reliance on export-led growth.   

Improving the International System 

The current international monetary system is not working as well as it should.  

Currency undervaluation by surplus countries is inhibiting needed international 


- 13 - 
 


adjustment and creating spillover effects that would not exist if exchange rates better 

reflected market fundamentals.  In addition, differences in the degree of currency 

flexibility impose unequal burdens of adjustment, penalizing countries with relatively 

flexible exchange rates.  What should be done? 

The answers differ depending on whether one is talking about the long term or the 

short term.  In the longer term, significantly greater flexibility in exchange rates to reflect 

market forces would be desirable and achievable.  That flexibility would help facilitate 

global rebalancing and reduce the problems of policy spillovers that emerging market 

economies are confronting today.  The further liberalization of exchange rate and capital 

account regimes would be most effective if it were accompanied by complementary 

financial and structural policies to help achieve better global balance in trade and capital 

flows.  For example, surplus countries could speed adjustment with policies that boost 

domestic spending, such as strengthening the social safety net, improving retail credit 

markets to encourage domestic consumption, or other structural reforms.  For their part, 

deficit countries need to do more over time to narrow the gap between investment and 

national saving.  In the United States, putting fiscal policy on a sustainable path is a 

critical step toward increasing national saving in the longer term.  Higher private saving 

would also help.  And resources will need to shift into the production of export- and 

import-competing goods.  Some of these shifts in spending and production are already 

occurring; for example, China is taking steps to boost domestic demand and the U.S. 

personal saving rate has risen sharply since 2007. 

In the near term, a shift of the international regime toward one in which exchange 

rates respond flexibly to market forces is, unfortunately, probably not practical for all 


- 14 - 
 


economies.  Some emerging market economies do not have the infrastructure to support a 

fully convertible, internationally traded currency and to allow unrestricted capital flows.  

Moreover, the internal rebalancing associated with exchange rate appreciation--that is, 

the shifting of resources and productive capacity from production for external markets to 

production for the domestic market--takes time. 

That said, in the short term, rebalancing economic growth between the advanced 

and emerging market economies should remain a common objective, as a two-speed 

global recovery may not be sustainable.  Appropriately accommodative policies in the 

advanced economies help rather hinder this process.  But the rebalancing of growth 

would also be facilitated if fast-growing countries, especially those with large current 

account surpluses, would take action to reduce their surpluses, while slow-growing 

countries, especially those with large current account deficits, take parallel actions to 

reduce those deficits.  Some shift of demand from surplus to deficit countries, which 

could be compensated for if necessary by actions to strengthen domestic demand in the 

surplus countries, would accomplish two objectives.  First, it would be a down payment 

toward global rebalancing of trade and current accounts, an essential outcome for long-

run economic and financial stability.  Second, improving the trade balances of slow-

growing countries would help them grow more quickly, perhaps reducing the need for 

accommodative policies in those countries while enhancing the sustainability of the 

global recovery.  Unfortunately, so long as exchange rate adjustment is incomplete and 

global growth prospects are markedly uneven, the problem of excessively strong capital 

inflows to emerging markets may persist. 

Conclusion 


- 15 - 
 


As currently constituted, the international monetary system has a structural flaw:  

It lacks a mechanism, market based or otherwise, to induce needed adjustments by 

surplus countries, which can result in persistent imbalances.  This problem is not new.  

For example, in the somewhat different context of the gold standard in the period prior to 

the Great Depression, the United States and France ran large current account surpluses, 

accompanied by large inflows of gold.  However, in defiance of the so-called rules of the 

game of the international gold standard, neither country allowed the higher gold reserves 

to feed through to their domestic money supplies and price levels, with the result that the 

real exchange rate in each country remained persistently undervalued.  These policies 

created deflationary pressures in deficit countries that were losing gold, which helped 

bring on the Great Depression.3  The gold standard was meant to ensure economic and 

financial stability, but failures of international coordination undermined these very goals.  

Although the parallels are certainly far from perfect, and I am certainly not predicting a 

new Depression, some of the lessons from that grim period are applicable today.4

Thus, it would be desirable for the global community, over time, to devise an 

international monetary system that more consistently aligns the interests of individual 

  In 

particular, for large, systemically important countries with persistent current account 

surpluses, the pursuit of export-led growth cannot ultimately succeed if the implications 

of that strategy for global growth and stability are not taken into account.

countries with the interests of the global economy as a whole.  In particular, such a 

system would provide more effective checks on the tendency for countries to run large 

and persistent external imbalances, whether surpluses or deficits.  Changes to accomplish 

these goals will take considerable time, effort, and coordination to implement.  In the 

meantime, without such a system in place, the countries of the world must recognize their 

collective responsibility for bringing about the rebalancing required to preserve global 

economic stability and prosperity.  I hope that policymakers in all countries can work 

together cooperatively to achieve a stronger, more sustainable, and more balanced global 

economy.
