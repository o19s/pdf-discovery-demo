Inaugural Janet L. Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development 
 

Washington, D.C. 
 

December 3, 2018


Thank you, Chairman Powell.  It is my honor to introduce Chair Yellen.1 

When I first arrived at the Board, Chair Yellen offered me the opportunity to lead the 

Committee on Consumer and Community Affairs--even though I had little experience in this 

area.  I greatly appreciate the opportunity she gave me.  After visits to 16 communities across the 

country--both rural and urban--I can attest to the richness of our community development work.  

It helps us see the economy as it is experienced by Americans in their communities.  It provides 

a valuable perspective on our monetary policy goals by putting names and faces on the aggregate 

unemployment statistics.  It helps us spot problems in consumer credit in overstretched 

communities well before they show up in national statistics.  And it is essential in helping our 

banks meet their affirmative obligations to the low- and moderate-income communities they 

serve and to understand what is likely to be most effective in lifting up the lives of people in 

challenged communities. 

Janet Yellen’s experience as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 

during some of the most challenging economic times for our country no doubt shaped her 

commitment to the Federal Reserve’s community development work.2  One associate from the 

San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank recounts a meeting at the height of the crisis when staff 

suggested their exhausted boss should take a break from the round-the-clock emergency 

meetings.  Then-President Yellen stated that she had an obligation to continue working until such 

time that families were no longer losing their homes, their livelihoods, and their pensions.

That moment encapsulates Chair Yellen’s consistent orientation to how our work touches 

the lives of American families.  It is perhaps no accident that Chair Yellen delivered her first 

speech as Chair at a community reinvestment conference.3   

In navigating the Federal Open Market Committee’s objectives of price stability and full 

employment, Chair Yellen was attentive to low- and moderate-income communities, recognizing 

that Americans on the most precarious rungs of the ladder often feel the impacts of a downturn 

soonest and the longest.4  Chair Yellen brought the subject of economic disparities to the 

forefront of our conversations, consistently emphasizing the importance of an economy that 

works for everyone.5  

As Chair, Janet Yellen continued her practice of meeting with community members, 

where she had in-depth conversations about disparities in employment, labor force participation, 

income, and wealth, recognizing these direct interactions provide valuable insights no statistic or 

report can fully capture.  For instance, she visited the Manufacturing Technology Center on 

Cuyahoga Community College’s Metropolitan Campus where she participated in a roundtable 

discussion on the state of manufacturing workforce development in Northeast Ohio.6  

                                                           
3 Janet L. Yellen, “What the Federal Reserve Is Doing to Promote a Stronger Job Market” (speech at the 2014 
National Interagency Community Reinvestment Conference, Chicago, Illinois, March 31, 2014), 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20140331a.htm. 
4 “Differences in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during recessions, as 
less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and these differences shrink during recoveries. 
For example, in the second quarter of 2017, the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 
percentage points higher than for white adult men. This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to the 
smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.” Lael Brainard, “Why Persistent 
Employment Disparities Matter for the Economy’s Health” (speech at “Disparities in the Labor Market: What Are 
We Missing?” a research conference sponsored by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
Washington, D.C., September 26, 2017), www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/brainard20170926a.htm.  
5 Janet L. Yellen, Opening Remarks (speech at the “Economic Mobility: Research and Ideas on Strengthening 
Families, Communities, and the Economy,” a community development research conference sponsored by the 
Federal Reserve System, Washington, D.C., April 2, 2017), 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20150402a.htm.  
6 Janet L. Yellen, “Inflation, Uncertainty, and Monetary Policy” (speech at the “Prospects for Growth: Reassessing 
the Fundamentals” 59th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics, Cleveland, Ohio, 
September 26, 2017), www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170926a.htm.

We are committed to continuing Chair Yellen’s legacy.  In our service to the American 

people, we recognize that our monetary policy, financial stability, and supervisory activities have 

an important influence on the financial health of Americans in communities across the country. 

Promoting community development is one of the key purposes and functions of the Federal 

Reserve, and we have a responsibility to ensure that consumer and community perspectives 

inform Federal Reserve policy, research, and actions, including vulnerable communities.7   

In his inaugural remarks as Chairman, Jay Powell underscored that it is our duty at the 

Federal Reserve to “approach every issue through a rigorous evaluation of the facts, theory, 

empirical analysis, and relevant research.”8  That lens informs our community development 

responsibilities:  we seek to learn from the experience of manufacturing workers, homeowners, 

community bankers, nonprofit executives, community organizers, and small business owners to 

help inform our policymaking.9 

Under Chair Yellen’s leadership, the Board of Governors established a Community 

Advisory Council (CAC) to help provide regular insights into the conditions facing low- and 

moderate-income communities.10  Recently, CAC members provided informative public 

comments to the Board on the Community Reinvestment Act and current market conditions 

within low- and moderate-income communities.11

particular focus on the concerns of low- and moderate-income populations.”

Under Chair Powell’s leadership, Eric Belsky, Anna Boyd, Federal Reserve Bank of 

Cleveland President Loretta Mester--who chairs the Committee on Research, Public Information, 

and Community Affairs for Reserve Bank presidents--and community development staff across 

the System are continuing to advance this agenda.  Over the past year, all 12 Reserve Banks have 

adopted a common community development strategic plan that seeks to advance the economic 

resilience and mobility of low- and moderate-income households and communities and to 

enhance public awareness of these issues. 

During Chair Yellen’s 16 years as a public servant in the Federal Reserve, her words, 

actions, and research demonstrated a deep commitment to striving for an inclusive economy and 

recognizing the challenges faced by underserved communities.12  From her speeches to her 

policy deliberations, Janet made clear that her duty was to serve Main Street and all Americans.  

The Award for Excellence in Community Development that we are establishing tonight 

memorializes Janet Yellen’s commitment to the people and places that make up our vibrant 

economy, including those who face challenges.  Going forward, we will look to celebrate staff 

within the System like Ariel Cisneros--the first to receive this award in Janet Yellen’s name--

thus honoring those who innovate, trailblaze, and embody the same deep-seated commitment to 

low- and moderate-income communities that Janet Yellen espouses.  With that, it is my great 

pleasure to introduce Chair Janet Yellen.
