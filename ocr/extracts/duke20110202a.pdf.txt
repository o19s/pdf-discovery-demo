February 2, 2011 





It is great to be back at the University of North Carolina.  And I am most honored 

to take part in the Kenan-Flagler Business School’s Dean’s Speaker Series.  I am a proud 

graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill.  However, my area of study was not what most would 

consider a logical first step for someone who would one day become a central banker.  I 

was an aspiring actress, and spent most of my time across campus at Playmaker Theater 

earning a degree in dramatic art.  Tonight I have been asked to share with you some of 

the memorable experiences I have had since I was last in a Chapel Hill classroom--some 

of the amazing opportunities that shaped my journey from Carolina Playmaker to Federal 

Reserve Governor.   

I’ll talk a bit about banking and the important role lending plays in the economy.  

I’ll describe how my banking career led me to a seat on the Federal Reserve Board and 

how that unique perspective helped me add value after I arrived there.  I will then explain 

some of the actions taken by the central bank at a time of extraordinary financial 

uncertainty, and I’ll describe some of the attributes that make the Federal Reserve an 

institution like no other.  I’ll end with a few thoughts that might resonate with the 

students in the audience as they conclude their studies and prepare to join the workforce. 

Bye, Bye Broadway, Hello Boardroom 

 I chose a career in banking for one simple reason:  I needed a job.  Regardless of 

economic conditions, the acting profession has an unemployment rate of about 95 

percent--or so it seemed to me at the time.  So I looked for something I could do almost 

anywhere and with hours that would leave plenty of time to pursue my dream.  I found a 

job as a part-time drive-through teller.  Later when I needed a full-time job, I went to 

work in a start-up bank.  And even though I didn’t start out to be a banker, I found a 


 - 2 -

career in that little bank.   

 The president of the bank was an old-fashioned community banker and a natural 

teacher.  He taught me everything he knew about banking, and that was plenty.  Fifteen 

years later, when he died suddenly of a massive heart attack, I had learned enough to take 

his place as chief executive officer.   

My banking education began with him as my mentor and with plenty of on-the-

job training.  Because the bank was just starting up, there were only 11 employees.  With 

lots of work to be done and not many people to do it, I was able to try my hand at nearly 

every job at the bank and to see the results of every action that was taken.  One of those 

early jobs was reconciling the bank’s account at the Federal Reserve and calculating the 

bank’s reserve position.   

Today, I spend a lot of my time thinking about the collective reserves held by all 

banks and how those reserves impact our economy.  My early experiences with making 

reserve decisions for a tiny community bank makes it much easier to connect the dots 

between Federal Reserve actions to add or withdraw reserves, bankers’ decisions to 

manage their reserve accounts, and the resulting impact on interest rates, which in turn 

influence economic activity. 

 The banking industry has a tradition of teaching basic concepts of bank 

management through in-house or industry-sponsored banking schools.  Once I realized 

that my talent for banking was much stronger than my natural acting ability, I started 

going to banking schools to learn about bank investments, lending, and bank 

management.  And I earned a masters in business administration while going to school at 

night.  I soon began teaching bank management in the same schools I had attended 


 - 3 -

earlier.   

One of the best teaching tools I discovered was bank simulation.  I worked with a 

number of models, helped design a few of them, and ran several hundred simulation 

exercises over the years.  As issues have developed throughout the financial crisis and the 

recovery, I have had more than a few occasions to be grateful for the deep understanding 

of how banks and bankers react to various external conditions that I gained from all those 

simulations.  I guess you could say that, though I was the teacher, the person who learned 

the most from those simulations was me.  And I have discovered that the Federal Reserve 

uses its own models of the economy to simulate outcomes and create economic forecasts 

under a variety of assumptions. 

 Much of my time as a community banker was spent lending to small businesses.  

In many banks today, small business lending is an automated process that relies on 

computers to analyze data and determine a borrower’s creditworthiness.  For me, the 

process was personal.  It involved sitting eyeball to eyeball across the table from my 

customer.  More often than not, the customer was someone I knew well, and had been 

lending to for years.  Occasionally, he or she represented the second or even third 

generation to run the business.  Or the business itself was the second or third venture that 

I had financed for the same borrower.  There were financial statements to be gathered and 

analyzed.  Usually it was difficult, if not impossible, to separate the business and personal 

finances.  But understanding the borrower’s ability to successfully run a business was just 

as important as analyzing the numbers.  I spent a lot of time talking to business owners 

about their businesses.  In fact, sometimes I thought they came in looking for a sounding 

board for their ideas as much as they were looking for money.  And I couldn’t always 


 - 4 -

make the loan.   

At times, especially during the economic downturn of the early 1990s, I had to 

deal with problem loans.  Some were resolved through restructure and some through 

foreclosure.  Now, as a bank regulator in the middle of a financial crisis, this deep 

personal understanding of the lending and loan collection process strongly influences my 

policy views.  And I have never lost sight of the importance of those small businesses to 

local economies or the importance of loan availability to small businesses. 

From Community Banker to Central Banker   

I fully expected to complete my career working as a community banker in my 

hometown.  But in early 2007, I received a call asking if I would be interested in serving 

as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.  I was intrigued, 

flattered, and more than a little intimidated by the prospect.  I had interacted with the Fed 

throughout my banking career and had even served on the Board of Directors of the 

Richmond Federal Reserve Bank.  So I knew a lot about the Federal Reserve.  But there 

was no way that I, or anyone else, could have foreseen the tumultuous events that were 

about to unfold. 

The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States.  The Congress 

created the Federal Reserve in 1913, after a series of banking panics, “to furnish an 

elastic currency, to afford a means of rediscounting commercial paper, to establish a 

more effective supervision of banking in the United States and for other purposes.”1  

When I joined the Board of Governors in August 2008, the Fed’s ability to respond to 

financial crises was about to be tested as never before.   

For as long as they have existed, central banks have calmed financial crises by

lending to financial institutions against good collateral.  Because central banks step in 

when other sources of funds retreat, central banks acting in this capacity are known as 

lenders of last resort.  But that phrase doesn’t mean that central banks make bad loans; 

nearly all of their loans are to sound borrowers with sound collateral.  Banks rely on 

short-term funding such as overnight interbank loans or customer deposits to make the 

longer-term loans their customers need.  If funding becomes scarce, banks become less 

willing to extend credit.  To maintain the flow of credit to businesses and consumers, the 

Federal Reserve provides short-term credit to sound depository institutions as needed.  To 

ensure that banks use the facility only as a backup source of funds, Federal Reserve loans 

are made at an above-market rate.  

In the Panic of 2008, liquidity needs were not confined to the banking system.  

The shadow banking system, made up of investment banks, money market funds, finance 

companies, and investors in a wide range of debt securities, provided a large part of the 

credit that fueled our economy.  When panic set in, it froze lending in banks and non-

banks alike and produced funding pressures across a wide range of markets and 

institutions.  The actions taken by the Federal Reserve to fight the crisis were quite 

traditional in the sense that, for years, central banks have been providing liquidity by 

lending to financial intermediaries.  But they were unconventional in that the concepts 

had to be adapted to fit markets and lenders that had never been supported by the Federal 

Reserve before.   

Now, I didn’t live through the banking crises of the distant past or those that 

might have occurred in other countries.  But I can tell you what it was like at the center of 

the most recent crisis.  Funding was drying up for one institution after another and for 


 - 6 -

one market after another.  Our efforts to provide liquidity were criticized by some as 

bailouts for the banks.   I can understand how it could seem that way, but I also know that 

every action the Fed took was directed at improving the economy rather than the well-

being of the banks.   

We had to make many difficult decisions in the darkest days of the crisis.  For me, 

the decisions were made a bit less difficult by several factors.  First and foremost was the 

calm, decisive leadership by Chairman Bernanke, whose lifelong study of economics and 

economic history provided unique preparation for his own role in history.  Almost as 

important were the hundreds of Fed economists, lawyers, bank supervisors, and market 

specialists who worked around the clock to craft creative solutions to every financial 

market challenge.  I will never know how many hours it took to develop and implement 

all of the programs they presented in a series of emergency Board meetings.  I do know 

that they responded to every question and strived to mitigate every risk that was 

identified.  And while the strain was evident in their tired eyes, the collegiality and 

intellectual rigor that I have come to know as a hallmark of the Federal Reserve never 

wavered.  Finally, for me, was the knowledge of all those small businesses that depended 

on credit to run their businesses.   

The Fed provided credit to banks large and small.  In addition, through other 

programs, we supported securities made up of loans to households and businesses, 

including loans for business equipment, for inventory, for insurance payments, for 

business credit cards, and for loans guaranteed by the small business administration.  To 

be sure, lenders reacted to uncertain economic conditions and weaker borrowers by 

tightening credit standards.  But, with liquidity provided by the Federal Reserve, loans to 


 - 7 -

borrowers who met the tighter standards continued to flow.  The U.S. economy continues 

to face challenges, but I am convinced that the forceful actions of the Federal Reserve in 

2008 helped prevent what might have been a far worse scenario. 

 The Federal Reserve was originally created to guard against financial panics.  But 

in modern times, many people think of its primary role as responsibility for monetary 

policy.  The Congress has given the Federal Reserve two objectives, known as our dual 

mandate, to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In its conduct of monetary 

policy, the Fed influences the level of output and the level of prices in the economy 

through changes to interest rates and credit conditions.   

 During more normal times, the Federal Reserve’s policymaking is focused on 

short-term interest rates, our main tool for steering the economy.  The Fed influences the 

costs of borrowing to buy everything from cars to condos to computers by controlling 

short-term interest rates.  Interest rates can be lowered to stimulate borrowing and 

spending when demand is otherwise weak, or raised to dampen demand and curb 

inflation. 

Before I arrived in August 2008, the Federal Reserve had already responded to the 

weakening in the economy by aggressively lowering its federal funds rate target from 5-

1/4 percent in September 2007 to 2 percent.  From a historical perspective, 2 percent is an 

extremely low level for interest rates.  But as the financial crisis intensified and the 

economic outlook grew more dire in the fall of 2008, the Fed continued to cut rates.  For 

more than two years now, our policies have held short-term interest rates close to zero.  

Just as the Federal Reserve used traditional concepts in unconventional ways to 

provide liquidity to the shadow banking system and stop the panic, once our main 


 - 8 -

short-term interest rate lever was effectively at zero, we moved beyond traditional 

monetary policy to purchase longer-term assets and push down longer-term interest rates.  

In November 2008, the Fed began purchasing large volumes of longer-term, U.S. 

government debt and agency mortgage-backed securities, eventually increasing the 

commitment to more than $1.7 trillion before completing the purchases in March 2010.  

Those purchases put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates generally and 

helped normalize the spread between mortgage rates and long-term Treasury rates, which 

had widened during the financial crisis.   

Reducing longer-term rates influences the economy in much the same way as 

lowering the expected path of short-term rates.  For instance, the decline in longer-term 

rates lowers the cost and increases the availability of capital and credit, which in turn 

encourages business expansion.  In the most recent episode, another important result of 

lower rates has been a reduction in debt service burdens from existing debt.  Households 

in particular have significantly reduced mortgage payments through refinancing.  And 

numerous small business owners have told me that they could not have survived the 

downturn without low rates.   

In November 2010, recognizing that progress toward the achievement of our dual 

mandate was disappointingly slow, the Fed decided to put additional downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates by purchasing longer-term Treasury securities with a stated 

objective to purchase $600 billion by the end of June 2011.   

So far, I have talked about what the Federal Reserve has done during the time I 

have been there.  But I haven’t really told you what the Fed is or what it has been like to 

be a policymaker there.

The Federal Reserve is an independent entity within the federal government in 

that its decisions do not have to be ratified by the President or any other executive branch 

official.  The Congress, through the Federal Reserve Act, sets the Federal Reserve’s goals 

and oversees it, but the Federal Reserve decides independently how to achieve its 

congressionally mandated goals.  The ability to make monetary policy decisions that are 

free of short-term political influence is critical for central banks.  This is especially true 

because the effective conduct of monetary policy requires a long-term perspective.  A 

central bank that is subject to political pressure might opt for policies that favor rapid 

expansion in the near term at the expense of higher inflation in the future.  Such actions 

would surely result in the loss of the confidence and credibility that are needed to achieve 

the objectives of monetary policy.  Indeed, research has shown that countries with 

independent central banks have better economic performance and lower inflation than 

countries whose central banks are not independent.2 

The structure of the Federal Reserve is uniquely American in its decentralization.  

The Federal Reserve System is made up of the Board of Governors in Washington, D.C., 

and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.  The seven members of the Board of 

Governors are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  Each Reserve

Bank has a board of directors drawn from business, public, labor, nonprofit, and banking 

leadership within its district.  In consultation with the Board of Governors, the Reserve 

Bank directors choose a president to run the bank.3  The Board of Governors oversees the 

Reserve Banks and is responsible for formulating bank regulations; supervising banks; 

and for making decisions regarding lending, other than discount window lending, to 

depository institutions.4   

The Reserve Banks provide financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. 

government, and foreign official institutions, including making discount window loans 

and playing a major role in operating the nation’s payments system.  Under delegated 

authority from the Board, the Reserve Banks also conduct on-site supervision of bank 

holding companies and state-chartered banks that choose to join the Federal Reserve 

System.   

Monetary policy decisions are made by the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC).  While all 12 Reserve Bank Presidents and all members of the Board of 

Governors participate in FOMC discussions, the voting members of the FOMC are made 

up of the members of the Board of Governors, the President of the New York Reserve 

Bank, and four of the remaining Presidents on a rotating basis.5 

The culture of the Federal Reserve is an interesting blend of government, 

academia, and business.  Differences of opinion regularly occur, but they are a source of 

strength rather than conflict within the institution.  They add liveliness to the debate and

richness to the decisionmaking process.  The System is a treasure trove of data, research, 

and institutional memory about the economy and the financial system.  It is stimulating, 

and occasionally exhausting, to be surrounded by so much brainpower and intellectual 

curiosity.  But everyone approaches the work with a serious sense of purpose and 

collegiality.  It is hard for me to describe what it is like to work there, but if you ever get 

the chance to do so, I would highly recommend it. 

Lessons Learned 

 This brings me to my final task--to offer some career advice to those of you just 

preparing to enter the business world.  As someone who has spent more years than I care 

to count in that world, let me begin where I began.  I needed a job just as many of you 

will soon.  In searching for that first job or even some of the ones that come later, don’t 

be afraid to take one at an entry level, as I did when I started as a teller, or one that seems 

quite daunting, regardless of your qualifications, as I faced when I joined the Federal 

Reserve.  Look for a career that you enjoy and one that is well suited to your 

temperament and your talents.  Remember that what you think you want most in life 

might not be the thing that makes you truly happy.  I could have been miserable as a 

mediocre actress.  Instead, I happened upon a deeply rewarding profession that I loved.  

Indeed, I have found that life usually works out for the best--if you let it. 

 Whether you have found your perfect career or just a job to pay the bills, make 

the most of every assignment.  I told you earlier about my banking mentor, Burt Harrison. 

He was always loading me up with projects.  One day, while I was struggling to dig my 

way out from under a mountain of work, Burt came to me with yet another assignment.  I 

looked up from the task at hand and said, “You bring me work like you’re bringing me 


 - 12 -

presents.”  Burt huffed and returned to his office.  He returned a short time later and said, 

“I do think they are presents.”  And he was right.  Those projects taught me more than 

any class could have. 

 Finally, if, as I suggest, you are going to take advantage of all the opportunities 

that come your way, I would like to stress the importance of lifelong learning to develop 

the skills that will be needed to tackle new challenges.  You might very well find yourself 

pursuing a direction different than the one you trained for in business school.  But the 

lessons you learn here will still be important.  You will need to apply the concepts you 

know to situations that are different than those you expected to find.  And you may need 

to learn new concepts.  Your ability to think critically and creatively, along with your 

skill at tracking down the information you don’t have, will be among your most valuable 

assets.  Remember that, sometimes, asking the right questions is just as important as 

knowing the right answers.  And if you get a chance to teach others, take it.  Nothing 

solidifies your understanding of a subject like having to communicate it clearly to others.  

Use everything you have learned so far, take advantage of any educational opportunity 

that comes along, and apply what you learn.  It is one investment that I can guarantee will 

yield an enormous return.  

Conclusion 

 In closing, I’d like to make a shameless plug for public service.  Putting your 

knowledge and skills to work for the good of the nation is a very high ideal.  I think 

Woodrow Wilson--the President who inspired the Federal Reserve Act--said it well, 

albeit long-windedly: “You are not here merely to make a living. You are here in order to 

enable the world to live more amply, with greater vision, with a finer spirit of hope and 


 - 13 -

achievement.  You are here to enrich the world, and you impoverish yourself if you 

forget that errand.”  Aside from the obvious societal benefits, there is much to be gained 

personally from working to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people.  

It has been richly rewarding for me to bring decades of experience as a banker to 

discussions on matters that have the power to transform that very industry.  And I have 

been fortunate to work alongside other public servants who share the commitment to 

bettering the lives of the people we serve by working to ensure a strong financial system 

and a stable economy. 

 Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.
