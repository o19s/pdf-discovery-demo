It is a pleasure for me to join Jim Bullard and John Ryan in welcoming all of you to the 

second annual Community Banking Research and Policy Conference, co-sponsored by the 

Federal Reserve System and Conference of State Bank Supervisors.  I had the privilege of 

addressing the inaugural community banking conference held here last year, and as chairman of 

the Federal Reserve Board’s Subcommittee on Smaller Regional and Community Banking, I am 

delighted to return to this venue to participate in this year’s event.1      

As all of you surely know, community banks play a vital role in America’s financial 

system, providing essential services to households, small businesses, and small farms in 

communities throughout the country.  Community banks differ from their larger cousins, not just 

in size, but in the fundamental focus of their business.  Community bankers’ primary objective is 

to serve the members of their local communities, who are not only their customers but also their 

neighbors and friends.  They have strong links to the people and businesses that reside in their 

communities, as well as direct knowledge of local economic conditions.  These close ties give 

community bankers a clear advantage in understanding local needs and tailoring their products 

and services to meet those needs.  I will confess that I have never worked at a community bank; 

however, I have been a community bank customer, and in that role I have had personal 

experience interacting with bankers whose mission is to provide high quality of service to every 

customer who walks in the door. 

Despite the advantages that I just mentioned, life is not always easy for community 

bankers.  The number of community banks in the United States has declined sharply over the 

past three decades, due to a combination of failures and acquisitions.2  And many remaining

community banks have struggled to survive, especially during the last five or six years.  

Although improving overall economic conditions have begun to provide some relief to these 

struggling banks, they continue to face significant challenges.  The burden of regulatory 

compliance can be particularly daunting for small banks.  And competition, from large banks and 

credit unions as well as other nonbank financial service providers, is always a concern.   

My colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board and I are committed to making sure that we 

understand the challenges faced by community banks.  One way that we further our 

understanding is by talking to the bankers themselves.  The entire Board of Governors meets 

twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, which includes 

representatives of community banks, thrifts, and credit unions in each of the 12 Federal Reserve 

Districts.3  Individual governors also take advantage of opportunities to meet with community 

bankers from time to time.  During last year’s conference I met with a group of St. Louis area 

community bankers to hear what was on their minds.  I will conduct a nationwide webinar with 

community bankers next month.  In fact, I speak regularly to a number of bank executives, 

including those who run smaller institutions.  I find these types of conversations--with people 

who live and work in the world outside the Capital Beltway and far from Wall Street--to be 

particularly enlightening.  And, of course, this conference, which was conceived as the result of a 

successful collaboration between the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank 

Supervisors, provides an annual opportunity for community bankers, bank regulators, and 

academic researchers to come together to share ideas and insights surrounding the issues that 

matter most to community bankers.

This year’s program includes presentations by the authors of a number of excellent 

academic research papers, the unveiling of the results of a new survey of community banks 

conducted on behalf of the conference organizers, reactions by community bankers to the 

research and survey findings, and several compelling speeches.     

The primary focus of today’s agenda is research.  The response to the conference’s call 

for papers was quite impressive, and the conference research committee faced the challenging 

task of selecting the most relevant, interesting, and high-quality papers to be included in the 

program.  The authors of these papers include academics and policymakers, with backgrounds in 

law, economics, and finance.  The topics covered clearly demonstrate a desire, on the part of the 

researchers, to promote a deeper understanding of what makes community banks tick and of how 

a wide range of government policies affects the activities, profitability, and viability of 

community banks. 

The first session considers factors underlying community bank formation, behavior, and 

performance.  The first paper looks at characteristics of newly chartered banks--where they form, 

and how they fare over time.  The second paper also focuses on newly chartered banks, 

considering possible explanations for the near absence of new bank charters over the past few 

years.  Those of us at the Fed pay a great deal of attention to this type of bank formation, because 

it is the primary source of new competition in the markets in which community banks compete.  

The third paper in this session looks at how rivalry among banks affects their decisions to adopt 

new technology, and the fourth seeks to explain the persistence of low net-interest income 

among community banks in recent years.  

The second session addresses the effects, both intended and unintended, of specific 

government policies on community bank behavior.  One paper looks at how the 2006

commercial real estate guidance for banks affected loan growth.4  Another paper examines the 

effect of the creation of the Small Business Lending Fund on community bank lending to small 

businesses.  The third paper in this session focuses on what happens when banks perceive that 

examiners have given them inappropriately negative evaluations.   

The underlying theme of the third research session is how broad government policies 

affect community bank profitability and viability.  The first paper provides an overview of the 

effects of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on community 

banks.  The second paper considers whether a provision of the JOBS Act that modified the 

threshold for Exchange Act reporting for unlisted banks and bank holding companies helped or 

hurt small banks.  The third paper contrasts the thousands of small community banks operating in 

the United States with the handful of very large financial institutions and proposes a new 

approach to regulation that recognizes the very different business models of these two types of 

institutions.  The fourth and final paper takes a high-level look at the effects of regulatory policy 

on the structure of the U.S. banking system and the viability of community banks.   

On day two of the conference, you will learn about the results of a recently conducted 

survey that was completed by more than 1,000 community bankers from across the country, as 

well as the feedback obtained from more than 1,300 bankers participating in town hall meetings 

hosted by state bank commissioners in 30 states.  The presentation of these findings will be 

followed by a panel discussion by a select group of community banking experts.

I hope I have succeeded in whetting your appetite for the sessions that lie ahead, and I 

encourage you to make the most of this unique opportunity to interact with bankers, regulators, 

and researchers who share a common interest in the future of community banking.
