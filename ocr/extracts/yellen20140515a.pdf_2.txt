Thank you, Administrator Contreras-Sweet, I am pleased to be at the U.S. 

Chamber, to have this opportunity to be part of Small Business Week, and to meet the 

outstanding entrepreneurs here this evening.  I am also grateful to be able to share a few 

thoughts on the important role I believe small businesses have played and will continue to 

play in America’s recovery from the financial crisis and the Great Recession.   

After the onset of the crisis, the Federal Reserve took extraordinary steps to 

stabilize the financial system and halt the plunge in economic activity.  Since then, the 

Fed has continued to use its monetary policy tools to promote the recovery and make 

progress toward our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  

By putting downward pressure on interest rates, the Fed is trying to make financial 

conditions more accommodative--supporting asset values and lower borrowing costs for 

households and businesses and thus encouraging the spending that spurs job creation and 

a stronger recovery.

tries to promote the conditions to foster job creation, but, overwhelmingly, it is 

businesses that create the jobs.  About 85 percent of nonfarm employment is in the 

private sector, which traditionally is the source of a similarly large share of new jobs 

during economic expansions.  So far during this expansion, public-sector employment 

has declined and the private sector has accounted for all of the net increase in 

employment, so businesses have been even more crucial to job creation than usual. 

Small businesses, of course, are responsible for a large share of these new jobs.  

According to the latest data from the Labor Department, a little more than half of the net 

number of jobs created since employment began growing in 2010 has been generated by
