The events of the past few years have raised many questions for central bankers.  

Although prompt and innovative actions by the Federal Reserve and other central banks helped 

prevent a severe economic downturn from turning into something even worse, our experience 

also highlighted a number of areas we need to study further to see whether we can improve the 

conduct of monetary policy.  I’ve titled my presentation “Homework Assignments” because I 

don’t think the answers are clear, though I will venture some tentative thoughts.  I have four 

assignments on my list; I could easily have more.  And others would have yet a different list.  I 

recognize that the complexity of these questions could keep us profitably engaged for a whole 

semester, but let’s see if I can outline some of the challenges and possible responses in an 

evening.   

 The first two assignments concern the policy actions the Federal Reserve and other 

central banks took during the financial crisis.  A key part of the Federal Reserve’s response was 

to fulfill its traditional role of providing backup liquidity to sound institutions during times of 

financial turmoil.  In a break with tradition, we had to provide that liquidity to nonbank financial 

institutions as well as to banks.  One assignment is to evaluate the implications of the changing 

character of financial markets for the design of the liquidity tools the Federal Reserve has at its 

disposal when panic-driven runs on banks and other key financial intermediaries and markets 

threaten financial stability and the economy.  In addition to providing liquidity on an 

unprecedented scale, we reduced our policy interest rate (the target for the rate on overnight 

loans between banks) effectively to zero, and then we continued to ease financial conditions and 

cushion the effect of the financial shock on the economy by making large-scale purchases of 

several types of securities.  My second assignment involves improving our understanding of the 

effects of those purchases and the associated massive increase in bank reserves.

The third and fourth assignments relate to whether changes to the conduct of monetary 

policy in normal times could make financial instability and its wrenching and costly economic 

consequences less likely.  Number three involves considering whether central banks should use 

their conventional monetary policy tool--adjusting the level of a short-term interest rate--to try to 

rein in asset prices that seem to be moving well away from sustainable values, in addition to 

seeking to achieve the macroeconomic objectives of full employment and price stability.  The 

fourth and final assignment concerns whether central banks should adjust their inflation targets 

to reduce the odds of getting into a situation again where the policy interest rate reaches zero.1   

Changes in Financial Markets and the Federal Reserve’s Liquidity Tools 

 Financial markets have evolved substantially in recent decades.  The task of 

intermediating between investors and borrowers has shifted over time from banks, which take 

deposits and make loans, to securities markets, where borrowers and savers meet more directly, 

albeit with the assistance of investment banks that help borrowers issue securities and then make 

markets in those securities.  An aspect of the shift has been the growth of securitization, in which 

loans that might have been on the books of banks are converted into securities and sold in 

markets.  Serious deficiencies with these securitizations, the associated derivative instruments, 

and the structures that evolved to hold securitized debt were at the heart of the financial crisis.  

Among other things, the structures exposed the banking system to risks that neither participants 

in financial markets nor regulators fully appreciated.   

The implications of these changes are far reaching, but I want to concentrate on those that 

bear on the tools we use to supply liquidity to the financial system.  Every central bank had to 

adapt its liquidity facilities to some degree, but the Federal Reserve had to adapt more than most.

Federal Open Market Committee.  William Nelson of the Board’s staff contributed to these remarks.

Before the crisis, the Federal Reserve adjusted the liquidity it provided to the financial system 

through daily operations with a relatively small set of broker-dealers against a very narrow set of 

collateral--Treasury debt, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities.  Those 

transactions had the effect of changing the quantity of reserve balances that banks hold at Federal 

Reserve Banks, and that liquidity was distributed by interbank funding markets through the 

banking system in the United States and around the world.  In addition, the Federal Reserve 

stood ready to lend directly to commercial banks and other depository institutions at the 

“discount window.”  At their discretion, banks could borrow overnight at an above-market rate 

against a broad range of collateral when they had a need for very short-term funding.   

But this structure proved inadequate in the crisis.  Interbank markets stopped functioning 

as effective means to distribute liquidity, increasing the importance of direct lending through the 

discount window.  At the same time, however, banks became extremely reluctant to borrow from 

the Federal Reserve for fear that the borrowing would become known and thus cast doubt on 

their liquidity condition.  Importantly, the crisis also involved major disruptions of important 

funding markets for other institutions.  Commercial paper markets no longer served as sources of 

funds to lenders or to nonfinancial businesses; investment banks could not borrow for even a 

short term on a secured basis when lenders began to have doubts about some of the underlying 

collateral; banks overseas could not reliably exchange their currency in swap markets to fund 

their dollar assets beyond the very shortest terms; and investors pulled out from money market 

mutual funds.  These disruptions posed the same threats to the availability of credit to households 

and businesses as did runs on banks in a more bank-centric financial system.  Intermediaries 

unable to fund themselves were forced to sell assets, driving down prices and exacerbating the 

crisis; they were unwilling to make markets necessary to allow households and businesses to 


- 4 - 
 

borrow; and households and businesses unable to borrow were unable to spend, deepening the 

recession.   

 The Federal Reserve responded by providing funding when it became unavailable to 

banks and other intermediaries.  We reduced the spread of the discount rate over the target 

interbank rate, lengthened the maximum maturity of loans to banks from overnight to 90 days, 

and also provided discount window credit through regular auctions to overcome the reluctance to 

borrow.  In addition, we created emergency liquidity facilities to meet the funding needs of key 

market participants, including primary securities dealers, money market mutual funds, and other 

users of short-term funding markets.2  We did so while generally adhering to time-honored 

central banking principles for countering a financial panic:  Lend freely to solvent institutions at 

a penalty and against good collateral.  We also lent dollars to other central banks so that they 

could help banks in their jurisdictions meet their dollar funding needs, thus easing pressures on 

U.S. money markets. 

 Now that the financial markets are functioning much better, we have closed the 

emergency facilities that we created to lend to nonbanks.  The homework assignment is to think 

about the design of liquidity facilities going forward.  I’ve tentatively concluded that the recent 

crisis has demonstrated that in a financial system so dependent on securities markets and not just 

banks, we need to retain the ability to lend against good collateral to certain groups of sound, 

regulated, nonbank financial firms.  I’m not suggesting that we establish permanent contingency 

liquidity facilities, just that the Federal Reserve retain the authority to create the tools necessary 

to meet liquidity needs of groups of nonbank institutions should a panic impair the ability of 

securities markets, as well as banks, to function and the Board of Governors find that the absence

York.

of such functioning would threaten the economy. 3  The collateral would have to be of good 

quality and the institutions sound to minimize any credit risk to the Federal Reserve.   

Holding open this possibility is not without cost.  With credit potentially available from 

the Federal Reserve, institutions would have insufficient incentives to manage their liquidity to 

protect against unusual market events.  Hence, the emergency credit would generally be provided 

only to groups of institutions that were regulated and supervised to limit such moral hazard.  If 

the Federal Reserve did not directly supervise the institutions that would potentially receive 

emergency discount window credit, we would need an ongoing and collaborative relationship 

with the supervisor.  The supervisor should ensure that any institution with implicit access to 

emergency discount window credit nevertheless maintained conservative liquidity policies.  The 

supervisor would also provide critical insight into the financial condition of the borrower and the 

quality of the available collateral and more generally whether lending was necessary and 

appropriate. 

 Large-Scale Asset Purchases and the Buildup of the Reserve Base  
 
 The Federal Reserve and other central banks reacted to the deepening crisis in the fall of 

2008 not only by opening new liquidity facilities, but also by reducing policy interest rates to 

close to zero.  Such rapid and aggressive responses were expected to cushion the effects of the 

shock on the economy by reducing the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, thereby 

encouraging them to keep spending.  In addition, the Federal Reserve and a number of other 

central banks have provided more guidance than usual about the likely future path of interest 

rates to help financial markets form more accurate expectations about policy in a highly 

                                                       
3 I am not referring here to the loans we extended to individual troubled institutions like American International 
Group, whose disorderly failure would have had catastrophic consequences for the economy.  That sort of lending is 
more appropriately done by the fiscal authorities and conducted only in association with the exercise of new 
authority to regulate and resolve systemically important institutions.

uncertain economic and financial environment.  In particular, we were concerned that market 

participants would not fully appreciate for how long we anticipated keeping interest rates low.  If 

they hadn’t, intermediate- and longer-term rates would have declined by less, reducing the 

stimulative effect of the very low policy rates. 

 Given the severity of the downturn, it became clear that lowering short-term policy rates 

alone would not be sufficient.  We needed to go further to ease financial conditions and 

encourage spending.  Thus, to reduce longer-term interest rates, like those on mortgages, we 

purchased large quantities of longer-term securities, specifically Treasury securities, agency 

mortgage-backed securities, and agency debt.   

Central banks have lots of experience guiding the economy by adjusting short-term 

policy rates and influencing expectations about future policy rates, and the underlying theory and 

practice behind those actions are well understood.  However, the economic effects of purchasing 

large volumes of longer-term assets, and the accompanying expansion of the reserve base in the 

banking system, are much less well understood.  So my second homework assignment for 

monetary policymakers and other interested economists is to study the effects of such balance 

sheet expansion; better understanding will help our successors if, unfortunately, they should find 

themselves in a similar position, and it will help us as we unwind the unusual actions we took.   

 One question involves the direct effects of the large-scale asset purchases themselves.  

The theory behind the Federal Reserve’s actions was fairly clear:  Arbitrage between short- and 

long-term markets is not perfect even when markets are functioning smoothly; and arbitrage is 

especially impaired during panics when investors are putting an unusually large premium on the 

liquidity and safety of short-term instruments.  In these circumstances, reducing the supply of 

long-term debt pushes up the prices of the securities, lowering their yields.   


- 7 - 
 

 But by how much?  Uncertainty about the likely effect complicated our calibration of the 

purchases, and the symmetrical uncertainty about the effects of unwinding the actions--of 

reducing our portfolio--will be a factor in our decisions about the timing and sequencing of steps 

to return the portfolio to a more normal level and composition.  Good studies of these sorts of 

actions are sparse.  Currently, we are relying in large part on studies that examine how much 

interest rates dropped when purchases were announced in the United States or abroad.  But such 

event studies may not be an ideal means to predict the consequences of reducing our portfolio, in 

part because the economic and financial environment will be very different, and also because 

event studies do not measure effects that develop or reverse over time.  We are also uncertain 

about how, exactly, the purchases put downward pressure on interest rates.  My presumption has 

been that the effect comes mainly from the total amount we purchase relative to the total stock of 

debt outstanding.  However, others have argued that the market effect derives importantly from 

the flow of our purchases relative to the amount of new issuance in the market. Some evidence 

for the primacy of the stock channel has accumulated recently, as the prices of mortgage-backed 

securities appear to have changed little as the flow of our purchases has trended down.   

A second issue involves the effect of the large volume of reserves created as we buy 

assets.  The Federal Reserve has funded its purchases by crediting the accounts that banks hold 

with us.  Those deposits are called “reserve balances” and are part of bank reserves.  In our 

explanations of our actions, we have concentrated, as I have just done, on the effects on the 

prices of the assets we have been purchasing and the spillover to the prices of related assets.  The 

huge quantity of bank reserves that were created has been seen largely as a byproduct of the 

purchases that would be unlikely to have a significant independent effect on financial markets 

and the economy.  This view is not consistent with the simple models in many textbooks or the 


- 8 - 
 

monetarist tradition in monetary policy, which emphasizes a line of causation from reserves to 

the money supply to economic activity and inflation.  Other central banks and some of my 

colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) have emphasized this channel in 

their discussions of the effect of policy at the zero lower bound.  According to these types of 

theories, extra reserves should induce banks to diversify into additional lending and purchases of 

securities, reducing the cost of borrowing for households and businesses, and so should spark an 

increase in the money supply and spending.  To date, that channel does not seem to have been 

effective; interest rates on bank loans relative to the usual benchmarks have continued to rise, the 

quantity of bank loans is still falling rapidly, and money supply growth has been subdued.  

Banks’ behavior appears more consistent with the standard Keynesian model of the liquidity 

trap, in which demand for reserves becomes perfectly elastic when short-term interest rates 

approach zero.  But portfolio behavior of banks will shift as the economy and confidence 

recover, and we will need to watch and study this channel carefully.   

 Another uncertainty deserving of additional examination involves the effect of large-scale 

purchases of longer-term assets on expectations about monetary policy.  The more we buy, the 

more reserves we will ultimately need to absorb and the more assets we will ultimately need to 

dispose of before the conduct of monetary policy, the behavior of interbank markets, and the 

Federal Reserve’s balance sheet can return completely to normal.  As a consequence, these types 

of purchases can increase inflation expectations among some observers who may see a risk that 

we will not reduce reserves and raise interest rates in a timely fashion. 

 In fact, longer-term inflation expectations generally have been quite well anchored over 

the past few years of unusual Federal Reserve actions.  And we are developing and testing the 

tools we need to remove accommodative monetary policy when appropriate.  I am confident the 


- 9 - 
 

Federal Reserve can and will tighten policy well in advance of any threat to price stability, and 

successful execution of this exit will demonstrate that these emergency steps need not lead to 

higher inflation. 

Monetary Policy and Financial Imbalances 

The past few years have illustrated two lessons about the relationship between 

macroeconomic stability and financial stability.  First, macroeconomic stability doesn’t 

guarantee financial stability; indeed, in some circumstances, macroeconomic stability may foster 

financial instability by lulling people into complacency about risks.  And second, some shocks to 

the financial system are so substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of 

intermediaries, that decreases in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or 

easily remedied by conventional monetary policy. 

Given the heavy costs of the financial crisis, the question naturally arises as to how it 

could have been avoided.  My third assignment is to reexamine whether conventional monetary 

policy should be used to lean against financial imbalances as well as aim for the traditional 

medium-term macroeconomic goals of maximum employment and price stability.  One key 

question is whether we are likely to know enough about asset price misalignments and the effects 

of policy adjustments on those misalignments to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away 

for a time from exclusive pursuit of our macroeconomic objectives.  Obviously, reducing the 

odds of financial crises would be very beneficial, but we need to balance that important objective 

against the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary policy for that 

purpose.   

One type of cost arises because monetary policy is a blunt instrument.  Increases in 

interest rates damp activity across a wide variety of sectors, many of which may not be 


- 10 - 
 

experiencing speculative activity.  Moreover, small policy adjustments may not be very effective 

in reining in speculative excesses.  Our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial 

increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot-com stock speculation in the first 

episode or on house price increases in the second.  And larger adjustments would incur greater 

incremental costs.  As a consequence, using monetary policy to damp asset price movements 

could lead to more variability in output and inflation around their objectives, at least in the 

medium term.  Among other things, greater variability in inflation could lead inflation 

expectations to become less well anchored, diminishing the ability of the central bank to counter 

economic fluctuations.  

We simply do not have good theories or empirical evidence to guide policymakers in 

using short-term interest rates to limit financial speculation.  Given our current state of 

knowledge, my preference at this time would be to use regulation and supervision to strengthen 

the financial system and lean against developing problems.  Monetary policy would be used only 

if imbalances were building and regulatory policies either were unavailable or had proven 

ineffective.  The homework assignment is to improve our ability to identify incipient financial 

imbalances and understand their interactions with changes in policy interest rates.   

A related issue, which I’ll assign for extra credit, is critical for the conduct of policy in 

the future.  Some observers have attributed the bubbles observed in some asset prices in recent 

years to a decades-long downward trend in real interest rates.  In this view, the decline in interest 

rates has caused investors to reach for yield by purchasing riskier assets with higher returns, 

driving the prices on riskier assets above fundamental values.  Many critics of central banks 

ascribe the drop in real rates to monetary policy decisions that kept rates unusually low, on 

average, over the business cycle  From my perspective, the decisions the central banks were 


- 11 - 
 

making about their policy rates were shaped by the  underlying determinants of the balance of 

saving and investment, including, in the past decade or so, the high saving propensities of the 

newly emerging Asian economies and the sluggish rebound in investment globally after the 

recession early last decade.  Nonetheless, it is important that we understand the reasons for the 

decline in average real rates and whether low rates are likely to persist--and that very tough 

problem is the extra credit assignment.  For one thing, as the economic expansion gains traction 

and central banks back off the current highly accommodative stance of policy, policymakers will 

need to understand how the longer-term trend in real rates has influenced the point at which the 

policy rate becomes restrictive.  For another, if rates are going to continue to be low by historical 

standards, regulators will need to be especially alert to any signs that a reach for yield by 

investors is contributing to excessive risk-taking.   

Inflation Objectives 

 The final homework assignment concerns the inflation objectives of central banks.  

Central banks have widely chosen to target inflation rates near 2 percent.  The Federal Reserve is 

required by law to conduct monetary policy to achieve maximum employment and stable prices.  

We haven’t announced an explicit inflation rate target consistent with that dual mandate, but the 

Federal Reserve governors and Reserve Bank presidents publish our individual forecasts for 

inflation over the longer run, conditional on our individual views of appropriate monetary policy.  

Those forecasts indicate that most of the FOMC participants believe that inflation should 

converge to 1-3/4 to 2 percent over time.   

 Recently, some prominent economists have called for central banks to raise their inflation 

targets to about 4 percent.  Shifting inflation targets up would tend to raise the average level of 


- 12 - 
 

nominal interest rates and thus give central banks more room to lower interest rates in response 

to a bad shock to the economy before running against the zero bound.   

 Although I agree that hitting the zero bound presents challenges to monetary policy, I do 

not believe central banks should raise their inflation targets.  Central banks around the world 

have been working for 30 years to get inflation down to levels where it can largely be ignored by 

businesses and households when making decisions about the future.  Moreover, inflation 

expectations are well anchored at those low levels. 

Increasing our inflation targets could result in more-variable inflation and worse 

economic outcomes over time.  First of all, inflation expectations would necessarily have to 

become unanchored as inflation moved up.  I doubt households and businesses would 

immediately adjust their expectations up to the new targets and that expectations would then be 

well anchored at the new higher levels.  Instead, I fear there could be a long learning process, 

just as there was as inflation trended down over recent decades.  Second, 4 percent inflation may 

be higher than can be ignored, and businesses and households may take inflation more into 

account when writing contracts and making investments, increasing the odds that otherwise 

transitory inflation would become more persistent.   

For both these reasons, raising the longer-term objective for inflation could make 

expectations more sensitive to recent realized inflation, to central bank actions, and to other 

economic conditions.  That greater sensitivity would reduce the ability of central banks to buffer 

the economy from bad shocks.  It could also lead to more-volatile inflation over the longer run 

and therefore higher inflation risk premiums in nominal interest rates.  It is notable that while the 

economic arguments for raising inflation targets are well understood, no major central bank has 

raised its target in response to the recent financial crisis.  


- 13 - 
 

Another approach to this problem is for central banks to target a gradually rising price 

level rather than a constant inflation rate.  Imagine a plot of the consumer price index (CPI) from 

today onward increasing 2 percent each year.  Central banks would commit to adjusting policy to 

keep the CPI near that line. 

The advantage of this approach, in theory at least, is that when a negative shock drives 

prices below the target level, people will automatically expect the central bank to increase 

inflation for a while to get back to trend.  In principle, that expectation would lower real interest 

rates without the central bank changing its inflation commitment, even if nominal interest rates 

were pinned at zero.  It could also make it easier for people to make long-term economic 

decisions because they could anticipate that inflation misses would be reversed over time, 

reducing uncertainty about the future price level. 

While I appreciate the elegance of this price-level-targeting idea, I have serious doubts 

that it would work in practice.  Central to the idea is that the Federal Reserve would be 

committing to hit a price level that was growing at a constant rate from a fixed point in the past.  

The specific inflation rate that could be expected in the future would change over time, 

depending on the inflation that had been realized up to that point.  You could know what 

inflation rate to expect only if you knew both the current consumer price index and the Fed’s 

target for the index in the future.  In addition, the inflation rate that you could expect would be 

different for different horizons.  Moreover, central banks are able to control inflation only with a 

considerable lag and even then only imprecisely, so the process of hitting a target would likely 

involve frequent overshooting and correction and consequently frequently shifting inflation 

objectives. 


- 14 - 
 

Contrast this approach with the communications required of central banks when targeting 

a specific inflation rate.  For example, central banks targeting a 2 percent inflation rate typically 

put that target prominently on their webpage.  If those banks were instead targeting a price level 

growing at 2 percent, their webpages would have to provide a table of inflation rate targets for a 

variety of horizons, and the targets would change each month.  I fear that rather than anchoring 

people’s expectations about prices, it could leave them perplexed.   

As you can tell, I see compelling reasons why central banks should stick to their current 

inflation objectives.  Those reasons relate most importantly to the effect of a central bank’s 

communications and behavior on its credibility and on the public’s expectations.  More study 

leading to a better understanding of the linkage between central bank actions and expectation 

formation should improve the ability of central banks to achieve society’s inflation and output 

objectives more effectively under a variety of circumstances, including in a severe negative 

shock of the type we recently experienced. 

Conclusion 

 Many central bankers and economists, myself included, were a little complacent coming 

into the crisis.  We thought we knew enough about the basic structure of the markets and the 

economy to achieve economic and price stability with relatively minor perturbations.  And we 

thought we had the tools necessary to deal with liquidity shortages and maldistributions.  The 

reality is that we didn’t understand the economy as well as we thought we did.  Central bankers, 

along with other policymakers, professional economists and the private sector failed to foresee or 

prevent a financial crisis that resulted in very serious unemployment and loss of wealth around 

the world.  We must learn from our experience.  The questions I’ve posed are tough, but 


- 15 - 
 

addressing these issues successfully should enable central banks to reduce the odds of future 

crises and respond more effectively to any bouts of instability that still might arise.
