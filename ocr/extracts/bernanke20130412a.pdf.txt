Research to Inform Policy and Practice” 


Federal Reserve System Community Affairs Research Conference 


Washington, D.C. 








April 12, 2013 





I am pleased to join you for the eighth biennial Federal Reserve System 

Community Affairs Research Conference.  The work you are doing here--sharing 

research and exchanging ideas on how best to further the development of low-income 

communities--is vitally important.   

As this year’s theme, “Resilience and Rebuilding,” reflects, low-income 

communities were particularly hard hit by the Great Recession.
1
  And, while employment 

and housing show signs of improving for the nation as a whole, conditions in lower-

income neighborhoods remain difficult by many measures.  For example, an analysis by 

Federal Reserve staff reveals that long-vacant housing units tend to be concentrated in a 

small number of neighborhoods that also tend to have high unemployment rates, low 

educational levels, and low median incomes.
2
  While some of these neighborhoods are in 

the inner cities, others are in suburbs.   

This analysis and others like it illustrate the close interconnections of housing 

conditions, educational levels, and unemployment experience within neighborhoods.  

Moreover, as this work confirms, poverty is no longer primarily an urban phenomenon 

but has increasingly spread to suburban areas, many of which lack the social and 

community development services needed to mitigate poverty and its effects.
3
  The 

implications of these trends for community development are profound.  Successful

 For example, the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) data show that the average wealth of individuals in 

low- and moderate-income areas declined on a percentage basis more than that in higher-income areas 

(21 percent versus 17 percent).  See the 2007-09 SCF panel data, available at

strategies to rebuild communities cannot focus narrowly on a single problem, such as the 

physical deterioration of neighborhoods that suffered high rates of foreclosure.  Rather, 

progress will require multipronged approaches that address housing, education, jobs, and 

quality-of-life issues in a coherent, mutually consistent way.  Moreover, strategies will 

have to be adapted to meet the special circumstances of urban, suburban, and rural 

settings.  As community development researchers and practitioners, you are confronting 

the challenge of effectively attending to the needs of both individuals and communities--

of people as well as places.  

The Evolution of Community Development 

Community development has a long history of innovation and learning from 

experience.  Notably, after decades of large-scale, top-down federal efforts, it became 

increasingly apparent that a one-size-fits-all approach did not serve local communities 

well.  The urban renewal programs of the 1950s and 1960s were perhaps the most 

prominent examples of well-meaning but misguided efforts to revitalize decaying inner-

city neighborhoods.  In practice, these policies often devastated neighborhood cohesion, 

leading their critics to argue for local, bottom-up solutions.  Perhaps the most influential 

critique of urban renewal and top-down planning was Jane Jacobs’s 1961 book, Death 

and Life of Great American Cities.
4
  In that book she celebrated the complexity and 

organic development of city neighborhoods in which intricate social networks enhance 

safety, quality of life, and economic opportunity.  In Jacobs’s view, a police force was 

not as effective at maintaining order as a neighborhood filled with “public actors” such as 

storekeepers, doormen, and interested neighbors acting as street watchers at all hours.  

The development of this sort of community self-monitoring is most likely to emerge, she

argued, in neighborhoods with a rich mixture of activities taking place in buildings of 

varying age, character, and use.  

For the most part, social science research has vindicated Jacobs’s perspective.  

For example, sociologists studying community resilience in the wake of natural disasters 

mapped deaths caused by an extreme heat wave in Chicago in 1995.
5
  They found, not 

surprisingly, that death rates were higher in poor areas where air conditioners were 

scarce.  But they also noticed a remarkable difference in the fatality rate in two adjacent 

neighborhoods--Englewood and Auburn Grisham--on Chicago’s South Side.  These 

neighborhoods were comparable by many measures:  Both were 99 percent African 

American, with similar numbers of elderly residents and comparably high rates of 

poverty and unemployment.  Yet Englewood experienced 33 deaths per 100,000 residents 

during the heat wave, while Auburn Grisham had among the lowest fatality rates in the 

city, 3 deaths per 100,000 residents.  Researchers found that a key difference between 

Auburn Grisham and other neighborhoods lay in its physical and social topography--the 

vitality of its sidewalks, stores, restaurants, and community organizations that brought 

friends and neighbors together, making it easier for people to look out for each other.  

This example illustrates a point that many community development practitioners 

have come to embrace:  Resilient communities require more than decent housing, 

important as that is; they require an array of amenities that support the social fabric of the 

community and build the capabilities of community residents.  The movement toward a 

holistic approach to community development has been long in the making, but the 

housing crisis has motivated further progress.  To be sure, implementing a holistic 

approach is easier said than done.  Government resources are still largely managed in

silos, and coordinating government agencies, philanthropy, and the private sector to meet 

the needs of local communities requires extraordinary commitment and effective 

leadership.  But persistence and effort pay off.  The holistic approach has the power to 

transform neighborhoods and, as a result, the lives of their lower-income residents.  

Let me give another example, drawn from the experience of the East Lake 

neighborhood in Atlanta, a neighborhood that exemplified the effects of concentrated 

poverty.  In the early 1990s, East Lake had a crime rate 18 times higher than the national 

average.  Nearly 60 percent of adults received public assistance, and only 5 percent of 

fifth grade children were able to meet state academic performance standards.  A local 

philanthropist, Tom Cousins, wanted to improve the quality of life in this neighborhood 

by de-concentrating its poverty.
6
  But he understood that East Lake’s problems were 

interconnected:  Replacing substandard housing would do little to attract families to the 

neighborhood if it lacked good schools, but schools couldn’t perform well if students 

feared for their safety, arrived hungry, and were otherwise unprepared or unable to learn.  

High dropout rates in turn fueled the neighborhood’s high rates of unemployment and 

crime. 

To deal with the interconnectedness of the neighborhood’s problems, Cousins 

determined to attack them simultaneously.  He created the East Lake Foundation to 

facilitate transformative change.  The foundation partnered with the Atlanta Housing 

Authority to replace the neighborhood’s low-income housing project with mixed-income 

housing that accommodated former tenants and other very low-income residents as well

as attracting new, higher-income families.  An independently operated public charter 

school for grades kindergarten through 12, named the Drew Charter School, and an early 

learning center serving 135 children were built.  A new YMCA health and fitness center 

began to provide wellness programs and to serve as a neighborhood gathering place.  

Finally, the foundation worked to attract commercial investments in the neighborhood, 

including a grocery store, a bank branch, and restaurants.  

Creating this plan and navigating the complex array of interests and resources of 

the community, the local government, and the private sector took 10 years of effort.  But 

the character of the neighborhood was fundamentally changed.  Today crime in East Lake 

is down by 73 percent, and violent crime is down by 90 percent.  The percentage of low-

income adults employed has increased from 13 percent to 70 percent, and Drew Charter 

School moved from last place in performance among 69 Atlanta public schools after its 

first year of operation to fourth place.  With 74 percent of its students receiving free and 

reduced-price lunches, Drew performs at the same level as public schools in far more 

affluent areas.
7
  The educational outcomes alone argue for the wisdom of the holistic 

approach to community development.   

The success in East Lake raises the question of whether a similar approach can 

work in other communities.  In 2009, Cousins launched a community development 

organization, Purpose Built Communities, to try to attain the same good outcomes that 

were achieved in Atlanta in other cities around the country.  Experience so far suggests 

that, while the framework can be replicated, it requires certain neighborhood conditions 

to succeed.  These conditions include (1) housing developments of concentrated poverty,

which can feasibly be replaced by good-quality mixed-income housing at sufficient scale 

to change the housing and income characteristics of the neighborhood; (2) the 

opportunity to create one or more schools accountable to parents and the community; and 

(3) civic and business leadership that is prepared to create and support an organization 

charged with coordinating the necessary partnerships and seeing through the long-term 

plans.   

As those involved in this effort note, the Purpose Built strategy is quite different 

from that of most other bodies whose decisions affect community development.
8
  For 

example, city governments rarely organize around neighborhoods.  School boards, 

housing authorities, and transit systems all make decisions critical to the health of 

neighborhoods, but they generally act independently of city government.  Moreover, the 

goals of such bodies are not typically measured in terms of the health of neighborhoods 

in any holistic sense. 

This mindset may be changing, however.  For example, Los Angeles recently 

adopted a community-based approach to strategic planning.  Its five-year consolidated 

plan recognizes that no single program or effort is likely, on its own, to lift families out of 

poverty or reduce crime in a neighborhood.  Rather, the plan calls for a multifaceted 

approach to “build healthy communities by integrating community, economic, and 

housing development investments with transit opportunities to increase their positive 

impact on neighborhoods.”
9
  It also recognizes the need to build the city’s institutional 

capacity so that it can effectively coordinate these efforts.  To that end, the mayor created

the Housing and Community Development Cabinet, which is composed of 

representatives from city departments from housing and transportation to health, family 

services, and economic development.  The cabinet will be responsible for identifying 

neighborhoods for coordinated investment across sectors. 

Perhaps one of the most promising new partners in community development is the 

health-care sector.  Factors such as educational attainment, income, access to healthy 

food, and the safety of a neighborhood tend to correlate with individual health outcomes 

in that neighborhood.  Because these factors are linked to economic health as well as 

physical health, health-care professionals and community development organizations are 

seeing new opportunities for cooperation in low-income communities.  For example, 

public health specialists and housing leaders are working together in Seattle to reduce the 

incidence in low-income homes of allergens that can cause or aggravate asthma.  Because 

asthma results in a significant loss of school days and billions of dollars in treatment 

costs, it is easy to see that these efforts have the potential to improve not only health, but 

educational and economic outcomes as well.
10


Beyond complementary interests with community development organizations, 

health professionals offer an important set of skills and tools, including unique data sets 

and sophisticated evaluation techniques.  For example, using data from 38 children’s 

hospitals, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Research Institute found an association 

between rates of foreclosures and poor health in children, including the incidence of

abuse.

  Health-related philanthropies are also investing in projects in low-income 

communities, ranging from projects to identify the health ramifications of proposed 

community improvements to increasing access to fresh food, by creating partnerships to 

subsidize grocery stores in low-income communities.

Accelerating Transformative Development in Communities 

These examples illustrate the benefits of broad-based collaboration for 

rejuvenating communities that, in some cases, have been in decline for decades.  

Research is helping sharpen this approach and give more insight into what works.  For 

example, in 2009, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston researchers evaluated the effects of 

concentrated poverty in Springfield, Massachusetts, as part of a larger study conducted by 

the Federal Reserve System.  Intrigued by the results, the Boston Fed researchers turned 

their attention to trying to identify the factors that make it possible for some cities to 

adjust to changing economic conditions while others languish.  To do this, the researchers 

identified 25 midsize manufacturing cities around the country that were similar to 

Springfield in 1960, when that city was at the height of its prosperity, and asked what 

accounted for the differences in the economic trajectories experienced by this group of 

cities over the past 50 years.  Remarkably, their analysis indicated that industry mix, 

demographic makeup, and geographic location made less difference to success than the 

presence of a community leader and collaboration around a vision for the future.  In some 

cases, leadership came in the form of an energetic mayor, but not always.  In fact, the 

study found that leadership could come from almost anywhere.  The successful leader 

                                                 
11

 Researchers found that each 1 percent increase in 90-day mortgage delinquencies over a one-year period 

was associated with a 3 percent increase in hospital admissions due to child physical abuse and a 5 percent 

increase in admissions due to traumatic brain injury suspected to be caused by child abuse.

was simply the person or entity that recognized the importance of preventing further 

deterioration in the local economy and agreed to take responsibility for the effort to turn 

things around.  The leader helped facilitate local collaboration, which was essential not 

only because economic development is complicated and multidimensional, but also for 

the more prosaic reason that outside funders typically require that all interested 

stakeholders commit to a strategic direction.  

The specific avenues to recovery varied among the resurgent cities identified in 

the Boston Fed study.  Some built on traditional strengths, while others created new 

business clusters from scratch.  For example, Grand Rapids, Michigan, was once known 

for its furniture manufacturing.  As those jobs disappeared, Grand Rapids worked to 

become a major medical center in the region, partnering with Michigan State University 

and Grand Valley State University to form the Medical Education and Research Center.  

Similarly, Jersey City has successfully transformed itself from a manufacturing-based 

economy to a financial center.  Its proximity to New York City makes this transformation 

seem obvious in hindsight, but other similarly situated cities have not made comparable 

strides. 

Most of the cities in the study made significant investments in infrastructure and 

people to aid the transition to a knowledge-based economy.  For example, Greensboro, 

North Carolina, worked with the nearby cities of Winston-Salem and High Point to build 

a regional airport and to replace its manufacturing economy with one based on high-tech 

research and production.  In a common pattern, Greensboro drew on local resources in 

post-secondary education, with community colleges providing courses to enhance job 

skills and universities partnering with businesses to develop innovative products--in 


 - 10 - 

Greensboro’s case, in nanotechnology and pharmaceuticals.  In New Haven, Connecticut, 

local universities collaborate with private industry and local government to support 

biotech-related education in public schools by providing teacher training, assistance in 

curriculum design, and a mobile laboratory. 

Developing Local Leaders 

These examples show that a city’s path to economic recovery typically depends 

on its ability to draw on its own particular assets.  Leaders that recognize the potential of 

those assets and foster collaboration in exploiting them can help communities remake 

themselves.  The question then becomes how to develop and encourage local leadership.  

Technical assistance, networking opportunities, and mentoring programs are just some of 

the ways that leadership can be fostered locally. 

Based on its evaluation of Springfield and cities of similar size, the Boston Fed 

worked with its public, private, and philanthropic partners to come up with an idea to 

enhance leadership and spur transformative change.  The Bank recently announced the 

Working Cities Challenge, a grant competition for smaller cities in Massachusetts that is 

designed to foster local collaboration to improve the economic health and well-being of 

low-income residents.  Initiatives winning grants are expected to demonstrate cross-

sector collaboration and involve groups that typically do not work together.  Prize money 

is being provided by Living Cities, a national philanthropic collaborative; the 

Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and the Massachusetts Competitive Partnership; 

among others.  The value of the competition goes beyond grant money, though that 

undoubtedly will help those who receive it.  The real value of the competition is that it 

will encourage conversations among local stakeholders that are necessary to make real

and lasting change.  Moreover, participants will receive access to technical assistance and 

planning resources, as well as to a growing network of public, private, nonprofit, and 

philanthropic leaders in the state who are focused on improving the economies of its 

smaller cities.  

For practitioners of community development, as in any field, joining a network of 

like-minded professionals is important for building skills and becoming aware of 

opportunities and resources.  NeighborWorks America, the leading provider of 

community development training in the country, has provided management and 

leadership training for community development professionals for more than 25 years.  In 

the past few years, NeighborWorks has expanded its programs to develop leadership 

among its network organizations’ executive directors and board members.  Recognizing 

that effective board leadership is key to the health and effectiveness of its more than 

235 member organizations across the country, NeighborWorks established the Achieving 

Excellence program in 2002 for its executive directors and others in the organization with 

significant responsibility.  This 18-month program offers professional coaching and an 

opportunity to work with peers to solve a particular organizational challenge.   

NeighborWorks also trains community leaders through the Community Leaders 

Institute.  The institute is an annual event that attracts some 800 resident leaders from 

across the country, making it the largest residential leadership development initiative in 

the field.  Attendees arrive in teams of eight and choose from more than 40 workshops on 

topics such as public speaking, planning, youth development, and mobilizing senior 

citizens.  After four days, the teams have not only learned new skills, but they have 

developed action plans addressing particular issues in their neighborhoods.  They are 


 - 12 - 

given a $2,000 grant as seed money so that they can return to their communities and 

immediately go to work.  More than 13,000 resident leaders have gone through the 

institute to date, and some cities have replicated the format to provide local training for 

residents.
13

  These and similar programs not only train leaders, but they also create 

networks, partnerships, and the opportunity to learn from each other. 

Conclusion 

In sum, community development is a complicated enterprise.  Neighborhoods and 

communities are complex organisms that will be resilient only if they are healthy along a 

number of interrelated dimensions, much as a human body cannot be healthy without 

adequate air, water, rest, and food.  But substantial coordination and dedication are 

needed to break through silos to simultaneously improve housing, connect residents to 

jobs, and help ensure access to adequate nutrition, health care, education, and day care.  

Moreover, each community has its own particular set of needs, which depend on local 

conditions and resources.  Accordingly, local leadership, together with a vision of what 

each community can be, is essential.   

With that in mind, I want to thank all of you here today for the role you play in 

bringing your skills in research and analysis to the important work of rebuilding lower-

income communities.  Community development leaders have no shortage of commitment 

to their goals, but with the insights you provide, together with the opportunities to learn 

from the experiences of other communities, they will be better prepared and thus more 

successful in meeting the very difficult challenges they face.  Thank you for being here.

 Salt Lake City has formed its own leadership institute based on this model and has trained hundreds of 

local residents.  In Seattle, training was provided in Vietnamese using translators and NeighborWorks staff.  

New Orleans, San Jose, and Charlotte have also begun to provide local leadership training for residents.
