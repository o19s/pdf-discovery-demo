Notwithstanding a number of shocks over the past year, the U.S. economy is 

performing reasonably well.  Job gains have been robust in recent years, and the 

unemployment rate has declined to 4.9 percent, likely close to its long-run sustainable 

level.  After running at a subdued pace during the first half of the year, gross domestic 

product growth has picked up in the most recent data, and inflation has been firming 

toward the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent target.1   

Although the economy has moved back to the vicinity of the Committee’s 

employment and inflation targets--suggesting that the cyclical drag on the economy has 

been greatly reduced, if not largely eliminated--along some dimensions this has not been 

a happy recovery.  Unease with the economy reflects a number of longer-term challenges, 

challenges that will require a different set of policy tools than those used to address 

nearer-term cyclical shortfalls in growth.  Prominent among these challenges are low 

equilibrium interest rates and sluggish productivity growth in the United States and 

abroad.  I will first touch on low interest rates before turning to productivity.  The federal 

funds rate and policy rates in other advanced economies remain very low or even 

negative.  Longer-term rates are also low by historical standards, even taking into account 

the increase of the past two weeks.   

Such low interest rates, together with only tepid growth, suggest that the 

equilibrium interest rate--that is, the rate that neither boosts nor slows the economy--has 

fallen.  Why does this matter?  Importantly, low interest rates make the economy more 

vulnerable to adverse shocks by constraining the ability of monetary policy to combat 

recessions using conventional interest rate policy--because the effective lower bound on

Market Committee.

the interest rate means that monetary policy has less room to reduce the interest rate when 

that becomes necessary.  Also, low equilibrium rates could threaten financial stability by 

encouraging a reach for yield and compressing net interest margins, although it is 

important to point out that so far we have not seen evidence that low rates have notably 

increased financial vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system.  More fundamentally, low 

equilibrium real rates could signal that the economy’s long-run growth prospects are dim.   

Why are interest rates so low?2  In a speech last month, I identified a number of 

factors that have worked to boost saving, depress investment, or both.  Among the factors 

holding down interest rates is the sluggishness of foreign economic growth.  Another is 

demographics, with saving being higher as a result of an increase in the average age of 

the U.S. population.  Also, investment recently has been weaker than might otherwise be 

expected, perhaps reflecting uncertainty about longer-run growth prospects, as well as the 

decline in investment in the energy sector as a result of the fall in the price of oil.  

Finally, and most important, weak productivity growth has likely pushed down interest 

rates both by lowering investment, as firms lower their expectations for the marginal 

return on investment, and by increasing saving, as consumers lower their expectations for 

income growth and borrow less and/or save more as a consequence.  

Understanding the recent weakness of productivity growth is central to addressing 

the longer-run challenges confronting the economy.  Productivity growth over the past 

decade has been lackluster by post-World War II standards.  Output per hour increased 

only 1-1/4 percent per year, on average, from 2006 to 2015, compared with its long-run

average of 2-1/2 percent from 1949 to 2005.  This halving of productivity growth, if it 

were to persist, would have wide-ranging consequences for living standards, wage 

growth, and economic policy more broadly.  A number of explanations have been offered 

for the decline in productivity growth, including mismeasurement in the official statistics, 

depressed capital investment, and a falloff in business dynamism, with reality likely 

reflecting some combination of all of these factors and more.      

We should also consider the possibility that weak demand has played a role in 

holding back productivity growth, although standard economic textbooks generally trace 

a path from productivity growth to demand rather than vice versa.  Chair Yellen recently 

spoke on the influence of demand on aggregate supply.3  In her speech, she reviewed a 

body of literature that suggests that demand conditions can have persistent effects on 

supply.4  In most of the literature, these effects are thought to occur through hysteresis in 

labor markets.  But there are likely also some channels through which low aggregate 

demand could affect productivity, perhaps by lowering research-and-development 

spending or decreasing the pace of firm formation and innovation.  I believe that the 

relationship between productivity growth and the strength of aggregate demand is an area 

where further research is required.

I will conclude by reiterating one aspect of the low interest rate and low 

productivity growth problems that I have mentioned previously--the fact that, for several 

years, the Fed has been close to being “the only game in town,” as Mohamed El-Erian 

described it in his recent book.5  But macroeconomic policy does not have to be confined 

to monetary policy.  Certain fiscal policies, particularly those that increase productivity, 

can increase the potential of the economy and help confront some of our longer-term 

economic challenges.  While there is disagreement about what the most effective policies 

would be, some combination of improved public infrastructure, better education, more 

encouragement for private investment, and more effective regulation all likely have a role 

to play in promoting faster growth of productivity and living standards.  By raising 

equilibrium interest rates, such policies may also reduce the probability that the economy, 

and the Federal Reserve, will have to contend more than is necessary with the effective 

lower bound on interest rates.
