Financial Stability and Shadow Banks:  
What We Don’t Know Could Hurt Us 


Remarks by 
 

Stanley Fischer 
 

Vice Chairman 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at 
 

“Financial Stability:  Policy Analysis and Data Needs”  
2015 Financial Stability Conference 

sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of Financial Research 
 

Washington, D.C. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

December 3, 2015 
 



I would like to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland and the Office of 

Financial Research (OFR) for inviting me to address this conference.1   

I have two goals this afternoon.  First, I will briefly share my overall assessment 

of the current state of the vulnerabilities of the financial system.  Second, I will outline 

areas where regulators and researchers can work to fill in gaps in our understanding or in 

the data available to monitor conditions, especially conditions outside the banking sector.  

With regard to current conditions, like most who follow financial sector 

developments, I see financial vulnerabilities in the United States as greatly reduced from 

a decade ago, on the eve of the beginning of the global financial crisis.  But despite this 

relatively positive overall assessment, the financial system is dynamic and will evolve 

over time, and the tightening in regulation of the banking sector may push activity to 

other areas – and things happen. In particular, while current shadow banking activities are 

much reduced relative to their level in 2007-08, some developments remain hard to track, 

and interconnections across the financial system are hard to measure.   

Several steps have been taken to reduce shadow banking risks, including 

restrictions on the support banks can provide to shadow banking activities and reforms 

designed to lower the incentives of investors to run on money market mutual funds.  But 

more needs to be done.  For example, efforts to limit leverage used to finance securities 

positions, such as the Financial Stability Board’s (FSB) recently finalized standard on 

minimum and potentially countercyclical haircuts on securities financing transactions, 

represent a further step in the right direction.  As the financial system evolves, we will 

                                                   
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on the Federal 
Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.  I am grateful to Michael Kiley and Nellie 
Liang for their contributions to this speech.

want, as my colleague Daniel Tarullo emphasized a few weeks ago, “to pursue a policy 

of case-by-case assessment that permits healthy forms of nonbank intermediation while 

protecting the financial system.”2  Doing so will require further development of the 

economic models that we use to understand interconnections across our complex 

financial system, along with better data. 

The Current State of the Financial System 

Factors promoting greater structural resilience 

Returning to the current state of vulnerabilities, it is well known that a range of 

structural improvements mandated by the Congress and undertaken by the Federal 

Reserve and other regulatory agencies have strengthened financial stability over the past 

five years.  Important changes in regulation and supervision include (1) requirements for 

more and higher-quality capital and other loss-absorbing capacity at banks; (2) new 

requirements for liquidity buffers at banks; (3) more stringent capital and liquidity 

requirements at the largest, most systemically important firms; (4) stress-testing of the 

largest banks; (5) the shift of the clearing of some derivatives to central counterparties 

(CCPs); (6) new margin requirements for uncleared derivatives transactions; (7) the 

designation of systemically important nonbank financial institutions by the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council; and (8) enhanced sharing of information among regulators 

and monitoring of risks to financial stability, in which the OFR has played a leading 

role.3  This is an impressive list.4 

                                                   
2 See Tarullo (2015), which also provides a complementary review of the structural changes in shadow 
banking activities that I will highlight. 
3 The OFR reports its monitoring efforts regularly, including in its annual reports (available on the OFR 
website at http://financialresearch.gov/annual-reports).  Research by OFR staff members on similar issues 
includes Flood and others (2015).

(Fischer, 2014).

Cyclical developments 

Turning to developments in the cyclical behavior of the financial system, at least 

five factors contribute to financial fragility:  (1) high debt burdens at households and 

firms; (2) elevated leverage and maturity transformation within the financial sector; (3) 

complexity and interconnectedness in intermediation chains; (4) low risk premiums on 

assets, especially assets funded with debt; and (5) complacency on the part of investors, 

supervisors and decisionmakers in the private sector of the financial system.   

At the Federal Reserve, staff members present their assessment of vulnerabilities 

to the financial sector in terms of these risk factors and further organize these risk factors 

along institutional lines--distinguishing among developments within the banking sector 

and the nonbank sector, with a special focus on nonbank institutions that engage in 

maturity transformation or deploy notable degrees of leverage.5  

Using this framework, I see overall financial vulnerabilities as moderate--that is, 

considerably lower than a decade ago.  Asset valuations and debt burdens in key markets 

do not appear outsized.  Perhaps most important, house prices, while substantially above 

their recent lows, do not appear broadly elevated relative to rents or disposable income, in 

contrast to conditions a decade ago.  Moreover, household-sector debt growth has been 

modest and driven mainly by prime borrowers, although rapid growth in auto and student 

lending across the credit spectrum may create repayment challenges for some households.  

However, signs of valuation pressures are emerging in commercial real estate markets, 

where prices have been rising at a solid clip and lending standards have deteriorated, 

although debt growth has not yet accelerated notably.  

                                                   
5 For a discussion organizing vulnerabilities along these lines, see Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013).

In the corporate debt markets, valuation pressures had been high for a while, 

before risk spreads widened and issuance slowed over the past year.  The high issuance of 

corporate debt in recent years is evident in the near-record-high debt-to-asset ratios at 

speculative-grade and unrated corporations, making this sector vulnerable to adverse 

shocks.  In addition, increased defaults could lead to sharper-than-expected price declines 

if concerns that liquidity in corporate bond markets is not as robust as in the past--a topic 

to which I will return in a few minutes--turn out to be justified.    

In the financial sector, regulatory capital ratios remain at historically high levels, 

and liquidity buffers appear sizable in the banking sector.  Capital ratios continue to trend 

upward for both life and property and casualty insurers. 

A Closer Look at Shadow Banking 

Still, our view of developments at nonbank firms that have traditionally relied on 

high leverage and short-term wholesale funding and were at the center of the financial 

crisis--the shadow banking sector--remains incomplete.6   

One source of information about leverage at nonbanks is the Senior Credit Officer 

Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), which the Federal Reserve 

initiated after the crisis.  The SCOOS provides information about the availability and 

terms of credit in securities financing and over-the-counter derivatives markets--for 

example, on credit granted by dealers to counterparties such as hedge funds or insurers to 

                                                   
6 I have previously discussed the lines between bank and nonbank activities (Fischer (2015)).  The term 
“shadow banking” has been in use for some time, and I continue to use this term in this speech largely to 
ensure some connection to discussion in recent years.  Recently, discussions of bank-like and other 
financial activities have begun to draw more clear distinctions regarding potential financial stability risks 
across activities; see Financial Stability Board (2015a) and the recent discussion in Tarullo (2015).  Finally, 
money market mutual fund (MMMF) shares are not, technically, debt claims.  However, the regulatory 
framework and historical precedent (in which MMMF shares had a fixed net asset value under normal 
conditions) appear to have led investors to treat such shares similarly to uninsured deposits.

finance investments in securities like commercial mortgage-backed securities or 

corporate bonds.  In recent years, the SCOOS has suggested relatively stable use of 

leverage across hedge funds and other counterparties--but this qualitative assessment 

provides only a high level, and very partial, view.7 

An important risk factor during the mid-2000s was the growth in securitization 

and the creation of so-called high quality collateral.  Currently, the volume of 

securitization is far below mid-2000s levels, with much of the decline reflecting the 

collapse in private residential mortgage-backed securities.  Further, the low level of 

activity probably understates the improvement in risk, as pre-crisis securitization was 

highly reliant on short-term wholesale funding through vehicles such as asset-backed 

commercial paper programs to finance the highest-rated tranches. 

More generally, wholesale short-term liabilities have declined across the board.  

For example, the gross volume of repos (repurchase agreements) fell from its peak of 

nearly $5 trillion in early 2008 to about $3 trillion by early 2009, while total assets of 

money market mutual funds contracted from approximately $3.75 trillion at the end of 

2008 to about $2.5 trillion in recent years.8  The decline in the volume of repos is part of 

a more general pullback from risk among broker-dealers and their clients, and dealer 

balance sheets are much smaller, on balance, than pre-crisis. 

Some, perhaps even the lion’s share, of the retreat in securitization, money market 

mutual fund shares, and repos is probably due to investors’ memory of the financial 

crisis.  Institutions and individuals burned by runs and losses from fire sale conditions

 - 6 - 

have, at least for the time being, adopted a more prudent stance.  But structural changes 

have also played a role.  The largest broker-dealers are now part of bank holding 

companies and are therefore subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve, 

which includes regular stress-testing and tighter capital and liquidity requirements.  The 

new liquidity rules for large banks and the capital surcharge for systemically important 

banks discourage reliance on short-term wholesale funding.  And the ability of banks to 

provide support to structured investment vehicles has been substantially curtailed through 

both restrictions on the accounting treatment of formerly off-balance-sheet exposures and 

more stringent capital requirements, including the supplementary leverage ratio applying 

to on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance-sheet exposures. 

Indeed, some have asked whether the reduction in broker-dealer activities has 

gone too far, citing heightened concerns over a possible shortage of bond market liquidity 

as one example of potentially negative consequences.  Most measures of market liquidity 

in Treasury and corporate bond markets have not shown signs of a deterioration in market 

functioning in recent years.  There are certainly concerns that bond market liquidity may 

not be as robust as in the past, which could lead to sharper-than-anticipated price 

movements--of which the bond market events in mid-October 2014 are often cited as an 

example.  However, a review of the evidence does not point clearly to a significant role 

for the reduction in broker-dealer balance sheets or regulatory changes as being 

responsible for any shifts in liquidity.9  Other structural factors, such as the long-term 

trends toward higher participation of high-frequency trading firms in Treasury markets 

and greater disclosure of corporate bond trades, have been important.

others (2015).

In my view, the reduction in leverage and maturity transformation associated with 

better regulations leaves the financial system much more resilient -- even if such 

regulations have modestly affected market liquidity. 

What We Know and What We Do Not 

Despite my assessment of current vulnerabilities, conditions can change quickly.  

And important blind spots in our view of the financial system remain, in part owing to 

data gaps. When it comes to financial stability, what you do not know really can hurt 

you--and there remains a good bit we do not know.10  

This lack of data can impede the design of regulation.  There is a long history of 

data collection focused on banks, and supervisory data have contributed to our 

quantitative approach to regulation and supervision.  For example, when we examine the 

likely implications of the failure of an institution’s largest counterparty, we learn a great 

deal about the health of that institution and gain greater insight into its connections, 

through that counterparty, to other institutions. 

But data on a range of activities--including securities lending, bilateral repos, and 

derivatives trading--that create funding and leverage risks remain inadequate and hence 

could prove destabilizing if sufficiently large or widespread.  We gain some insight into 

these markets through our supervisory relationships with the largest bank holding 

companies, but the activities of important nonbank market participants, such as asset 

managers, and the interconnections across institutions remain more opaque.   

                                                   
10 The phrase “what you don’t know can’t hurt you” is well known.  According to the Oxford Dictionary of 
Proverbs, the oldest written version of this saying comes from 1576, in Petit Palace, by G. Pettie (as noted 
in Miller (2009)).  (I am indebted to Michael Kiley for this reference.) 


 - 8 - 

Efforts are under way to deal with these gaps:  The Legal Entity Identifier 

initiative is working to allow regulators and private counterparties to trace activities by 

institution; the OFR, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Reserve 

are cooperating with the industry to collect data on bilateral repos; and the FSB has 

finalized standards for collection of data on securities financing transactions.11  

Regulators in the United States and abroad have begun to require the reporting of detailed 

derivatives transaction data to trade repositories.  Unfortunately, as a recent report shows, 

inadequate data standards and limitations on authorities’ access to trade repository data 

have prevented the benefits of derivatives trade data reporting from being fully realized.12  

An illustration of the possible interaction between better data and better policies is 

the potential role of margins in securities financing transactions.  The more stringent 

regulation of the banking sector may push short-term financing activities to less regulated 

entities.  To limit such regulatory arbitrage, the Federal Reserve will be developing 

regulations that would establish minimum margins for securities financing transactions 

on a marketwide basis.  The margins would apply to all market participants, thereby 

mitigating the risks associated with regulation along institutional lines.  Improved data 

collection, such as mentioned earlier, would allow a better view of changes in conditions 

and potentially contribute to the deployment of countercyclical margins, thereby further 

decreasing the chances of a dynamic that culminates in adverse fire sales.   

                                                   
11 Information on the cooperative effort to collect data on bilateral repos is available on the OFR website at 
http://financialresearch.gov/data/repo-data-project.  For details on the FSB’s standards for collecting data 
on securities financing transactions, see Financial Stability Board (2015c).

Data Are Not Enough:  We Need Theory, Too 

While the steps to improve data taken so far will help, gaps will remain, 

especially with regard to unregulated or weakly regulated entities.  These gaps impede 

both market participants’ ability to discipline the risks taken by institutions and 

supervisors’ ability to take prompt action.  Nonetheless, I would also like to emphasize to 

this group of researchers that better data, by themselves, are only the start of the journey 

to better understanding.   

An important area in need of development is economic modeling on 

interconnectedness, particularly on the interaction of shadow banking, banks, and the 

broader financial system.13  It is instructive to consider the distress at Lehman Brothers 

and American International Group, Inc. (AIG), in the late summer and fall of 2008 and of 

Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in the late summer and fall of 1998.  In each 

case, banking supervisors and market participants appear not to have appreciated--at least 

until very late--the degree to which these institutions were intertwined with large banks 

and other financial institutions; in each case, the concerns over the direct connections of 

these institutions were compounded by uncertainty regarding their positions, the positions 

of other institutions, and the potential fire sale dynamics that could occur under forced 

liquidation of their assets.  Most obviously, in each case the institution was not a bank, 

and understanding the implications of their distress required understanding the possibly 

different implications of their business models from those of banks, their interconnections 

with banks, and their interconnections with the broader financial system.  Of course, 

                                                   
13 Then Federal Reserve Board Vice Chair Yellen discussed these issues in January 2013 (Yellen, 2013), in 
a speech that includes a detailed discussion of possible interactions among financial institutions, along with 
very clear graphic representations of potential systemic interactions. 


 - 10 - 

many conditions across these episodes were very different, as were their end results in the 

falls of 1998 and 2008.   Because of those differences, distress at LTCM was resolved by 

a private-sector solution with little discernible effect on the U.S. macroeconomy, while 

the fall of 2008 culminated in the Great Recession.  But the commonalities across 

episodes illustrate similar data and conceptual gaps. 

Focusing on the conceptual gaps, the theoretical and empirical literature on 

interconnectedness sheds only partial light on the issues confronted in each of the 

highlighted episodes.14  In addition to direct connections, common exposures and 

contagion are important sources of interconnectedness and fragility, as emphasized by 

Bagehot nearly 150 years ago.15 On the empirical side, researchers have worked to 

construct networks of banks or broader sets of institutions based on direct connections or 

common holdings, but incomplete data and modeling challenges have typically implied a 

focus on only parts of institutions’ balance sheets or on a subset of market participants.16  

On the theoretical side, a strand of literature notes that the connections among institutions 

in each of the previous frameworks may be too small to explain the types of systemic 

distress witnessed during the crisis, and instead emphasizes that complexity within firms 

and in interconnections heightens the risk of correlated runs.17  This insight rings true:  

The complexity of Lehman’s, AIG’s, and even LTCM’s balance sheets and interactions 

with other institutions almost surely contributed to market spillovers during their distress.   

                                                   
14 For a discussion of various empirical measures outside the network literature, see Bisias and others 
(2012); and Kara, Tian, and Yellen (2015). 
15 Bagehot (1873 [1897]) has long been viewed as a classic reference describing panics in money markets 
and the proper response of the central bank to such panics. 
16 Duarte and Eisenbach (2015) examine interconnections associated with fire sales and common 
exposures.  Hale, Kapan, and Minoiu (2014) examine a bank network and discuss related approaches. 
17 Caballero and Simsek (2013) discuss complexity and network stability.  Research emphasizing direct 
connections and common holdings includes Allen, Babus, and Carletti (2012); and Acemoglu, Ozdaglar, 
and Tahbaz-Salehi (2015). 


 - 11 - 

But it is also true that little research has been undertaken that distinguishes 

between banks and nonbanks, or highlights how their interactions are driven by economic 

incentives.  Such research could guide regulator efforts to collect data and set policies to 

limit possible instabilities associated with interconnectedness.  At one level, this is not 

surprising:  As we all know, models are abstractions; nonetheless, improving the 

conceptual toolkit with which we gauge interconnectedness along practical dimensions is 

clearly needed.18 

Summary 

My current assessment of the risks to financial stability remains tentative and 

subject to change as we learn more or conditions shift.  Policymakers and researchers 

need better models and data to understand the interconnections between the banking 

system and nonbank financial institutions.  Indeed, one of the themes of this conference is 

data needs, and the focus on this issue is an important aspect of this conference.   

History has demonstrated that risks evolve in response to regulatory pressure and 

the animal spirits that emerge as memories fade, as well as to animal spirits.  As a result, 

the infrastructure needed to learn the things we don’t know needs to be put in place.  An 

essential element of that infrastructure is learning the lessons of history – both the lessons 

of what happened, and the fact that supervisors and regulators will on occasion be 

surprised.  Learning those lessons is not as simple a task as it may sound.  But it is 

certainly a far more important task than it sounds. 

                                                   
18 In a sense, this section has discussed what soon after the collapse of Lehman Brothers began to be called 
“macroprudential supervision”, by which at that stage was meant supervision that focused on the dynamics 
of the financial system that resulted from interactions among financial institutions, of which the worldwide 
impact of the Lehman failure was the outstanding example. Over the course of a few years, the term 
“macroprudential policies” began generally to be used as a description of sector-specific policy instruments 
that could be used to deal with potential instabilities in a particular sector, usually the housing sector.
