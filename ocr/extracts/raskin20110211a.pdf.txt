 Good evening.  I would like to thank the sponsors of the Midwinter Housing 

Finance Conference for kindly inviting me to join you.  Tonight, I’m going to share with 

you some thoughts about the powerful impact the housing and mortgage markets have on 

the nation’s economic recovery, present some ideas to effect positive change in the 

mortgage servicing industry, and finally impart a guiding principle that should help us 

find our way through the current struggles and drive the way our industry operates in the 

future.  

 Speaking strictly in an economic sense, the recession that emerged in 2008 is 

over.  But I know that the millions of Americans still looking for work, living in cars or 

motels, or trying to keep their businesses out of bankruptcy would beg to disagree.  Our 

economy is growing, but the pace of recovery is agonizingly slow, well behind the pace 

of recovery in prior recessions.  There are several causes for this lethargy, but, in my 

view, the critically important drag on the economy is the absence of any substantial 

recovery in the housing sector.  Traditionally, housing is the first sector to recover after a 

recession, buoyed by low interest rates and pent-up demand.  The increase in housing 

sales and construction usually is followed by a robust increase in consumer expenditures 

on durable goods, like furniture and appliances, which magnifies and multiplies the effect 

of the housing recovery. 

 Yet today, demand for housing is weighted down by the enormous losses in 

income and net worth that households suffered in the recession.  In addition, the 

persistent high rate of unemployment is further depressing housing demand, creating 

uncertainty about housing prices, and impeding that robust recovery in the housing sector 

that we generally see.  With a pipeline full of distressed properties, the unfortunate 


 - 2 - 

consensus is that we should expect even more downward pressure on house prices.  

Potential buyers seem inclined to wait and see if they can get a better buy in the future.  

Builders, too, are deterred by the additional competition lurking in this reservoir of 

vacant and distressed properties.    

 Significantly, uncertainty about house prices destabilizes expectations outside of 

the housing sector.  When banks have troubled mortgages on their books, they may be 

required to increase their loss provisioning and implement troubled debt restructuring, 

which in turn reduces the amount of funds they have to lend.  Uncertainty about house 

prices also clearly undermines consumer confidence and undercuts consumers’ 

willingness to spend. 

 According to the Census Bureau, homeownership rates have fallen so 

significantly in recent years that they have more than wiped out the increase in 

homeownership that had taken place between 2000 and 2007.  When I think about this 

statistic, I see not only the drag on the nation’s already-tepid recovery, but the millions of 

American families who have lost their homes and their hopes.   

When people lose their homes, the impact is felt not only by the homeowners, but 

by the broader community:  the bonds of community are weakened,  business investment 

is undermined, homelessness increases, children are uprooted, unemployment deepens, 

and even health problems multiply.   

I emphasize all this bad news not to dampen the dinner mood here tonight, but to 

underscore the importance of the work that you do and to reiterate what we already 

know:  The recovery of the housing sector is critical to the robust and sustainable 

recovery of the American economy.  To see the kind of economic recovery we want, we 


 - 3 - 

need to revive our housing sector and restore the communities that were shaken by its 

collapse.    

  So what needs to happen now?  To begin with, we should start at the ground 

level and work with troubled borrowers to prevent additional foreclosures that will 

further weaken the market.  We need to make certain that foreclosures take place only 

when there is no option available that would be preferable to both the borrower and the 

investor.  It is critical for servicers to review all options on any given delinquent loan 

before deciding that foreclosure is the best course of action.  Certainly foreclosure cannot 

be avoided in every case.  However, servicers must identify those instances where both 

the borrower and the investor would be better off modifying the loan than foreclosing on 

it.  Some distressed borrowers should be able to qualify for a modification through 

Treasury’s Home Affordable Mortgage Program (HAMP).   If the HAMP evaluation has 

been properly done and the borrower still does not qualify, the servicer should consider 

all other reasonable alternatives, ranging from proprietary modifications to short sales to 

deeds-in-lieu-of-foreclosure, before filing for foreclosure.  And, for homeowners whose 

financial distress is the result of job loss, something as simple as payment forbearance 

while the homeowner is unemployed could prevent the loan from going to foreclosure.    

Servicing shops need to be diligent in pursuing these options, and investors need 

to be supportive of efforts to find net-positive alternatives to foreclosure.  These actions 

will have a far-reaching positive impact:  A lower inventory of distressed properties for 

sale results in higher house prices, which leads to a healthier pace of recovery in the 

housing market and the broader economy.  I can’t emphasize enough how important it is 


 - 4 - 

that servicers be willing and diligent in offering assistance to troubled homeowners:  It is 

key to the pace of economic recovery.        

  For those in the housing and mortgage fields, making needed changes will not be 

easy.  In particular, for those in the mortgage servicing industry, it means difficult 

changes and significant investments to rectify broken systems.  For those servicers who 

are subsidiaries or affiliates of a broader parent financial institution, the responsibility for 

change and further investment absolutely extends up to that parent company, many of 

which have enjoyed substantial profits while their servicing arms have been run on the 

cheap.     

   In November, I spoke about the problems in residential mortgage servicing 

operations that were undermining the performance of this industry.  These problems 

existed before November and as far as I can tell they remain unaddressed.  How do I 

know this?  Late last year, the federal banking agencies began a targeted review of loan 

servicing practices at large financial institutions that had significant market 

concentrations in mortgage servicing.  The preliminary results from this review indicate 

that widespread weaknesses exist in the servicing industry.  The agencies intend to report 

more specific findings to the public soon, but I can tell you that these deficiencies pose 

significant risk to mortgage servicing and foreclosure processes, impair the functioning of 

mortgage markets, and diminish overall accountability to homeowners. 

 I’m sure this has been said, but I’ll say it again because I have seen little to no 

evidence of improvement in the operational performance of servicers since the onset of 

the crisis in 2007:  Until these operational problems are addressed once and for all, the 

foreclosure crisis will continue and the housing sector will languish.   


 - 5 - 

What is needed is strong corporate governance procedures for servicers that are 

established, monitored, and enforced enterprise-wide in order to prevent process 

breakdowns.  Servicers need sound policies and procedures that outline the rules, laws, 

standards, and processes by which internal operations are assessed.  Senior executives 

need to emphasize compliance and qualitative measures over short-run cost efficiency, 

and need to articulate the presence of adequate quality controls and audit processes to 

identify risks and take timely, corrective actions where needed.  Corporate leadership 

needs to communicate performance expectations that hold all business lines accountable 

to strong procedural controls. 

 If errors occur or internal processes become challenged, servicers must act swiftly 

and responsibly to contain the damage to consumers and markets.  Going forward, the 

servicing industry must foster an operational environment that reflects safe and sound 

banking principles and compliance with applicable state and federal law.  This is a 

primary responsibility of the servicing industry, but regulators now have to be prepared to 

monitor servicing functions on an ongoing basis to ensure confidence is restored and take 

enforcement actions, when necessary, to address significant failures.   

 I’m not going to outline for you the consequences of these failures.  You know 

them all too well.  Suffice it to say that when servicers misapply payments, lose 

paperwork, file incorrect foreclosure affidavits, or simply do not answer the phone or 

make available knowledgeable staffpersons, there are consequences to the consumer.  

With few adequate remedies to provide meaningful recourse in the event errors occur--

after all, it’s not as if consumers have a choice regarding who does their servicing--many 


 - 6 - 

consumers find themselves captive to practices that have emphasized speed and 

aggressive timeframes over responsiveness, accuracy, and completeness.    

 So something is wrong.  Here we are in 2011, looking at high levels of 

foreclosures on the horizon, looking at significant failures in process, and nothing much 

has changed since 2007.  I always thought this dysfunction was going on for too long--

but I’m someone who thought the successive waves of foreclosures in 2007 amounted to 

a virtual tsunami.  In my mind, massive foreclosures were always a sign of an equally 

massive market failure.  Well, now it seems to me we have reached a point where this 

sign of failure is hindering our economy’s ability to rebound.   

In addition to improvements that individual servicers need to make, we also have 

to find a way to fix broader problems in the industry and make it functional. 

In my November remarks, I began the conversation about a flawed business 

model that creates misaligned incentives in ways that are more difficult for any one 

company to change on its own.   So let’s talk now a little bit about how a better-

functioning servicing industry would be structured. 

 One step the industry could take that would have an enormous payoff for 

consumers and market participants would be to change its pricing model.  The economic 

incentives and pressure points of the current servicing model cause problems at multiple 

levels.   

 In addition to float income and ancillary fees, servicers earn money through an 

annual fee on each loan.  This annual servicing fee is an important income source that has 

to cover some wildly varying costs.  On a performing loan for which costs to servicers 

are minimal, the revenue stream from ancillary fees and float may itself be nearly enough 


 - 7 - 

to fairly compensate servicers.  But when a loan becomes non-performing, costs start 

climbing.  Costs associated with collections, loss mitigation, foreclosure, the maintenance 

and disposition of real-estate owned properties, and so on, are lumpy and can be high.  

The current model is structured with the hope that, over a given period of time, there are 

enough of the low-touch performing loans to cross-subsidize the high-touch non-

performing ones, so that the overall pool of servicing fee revenue is sufficient to cover 

expenses and return a reasonable profit.  But if that doesn’t happen, servicers are either 

being paid too much for their efforts or not enough.    

 The current model also rests on the expectation that, in good times, servicers are 

using some of the residual income to build out systems and procedures to handle the 

pressures that come with worse times.  Unfortunately, as we have seen, this has not 

happened. 

 A better business model--one that might attract more entrants and increase 

competition--would more closely tie expenses with compensation and  reduce many of 

the principal-agent problems that currently exist.  Rather than rolling most of the 

compensation into one annual fee that covers performing and delinquent loans alike, 

servicers could be compensated quite modestly for the routine processing of payments 

involved with performing assets.  They would be required to have either significant 

capacity for loss mitigation and the other work involved with non-performing loans, or 

business relationships with third parties, such as specialty servicers, that do. Contracts 

could spell out a structure wherein the investor would pay significantly higher and more 

direct compensation for the more labor-intensive work involved in delinquent loans, 

though they would need to be careful not to create perverse incentives to encourage such 


 - 8 - 

delinquencies.  There would also need to be much more clarity and specificity about loss 

mitigation standards and systems for auditing internal procedures.  Such a system could 

more appropriately compensate servicers and sub-servicers for the level of work involved 

in servicing very different types of loans.  Specialists could emerge who focus primarily 

on the routine performing loans or the more involved non-performing ones.  If the non-

performing specialist was a third party, the existing servicer could either transfer the 

servicing rights once a loan hits a certain delinquency trigger, or simply have the loans 

subserviced--of course with high levels of accountability--on a fee-for-services basis until 

the delinquency is resolved.  One structure along these general lines has recently been 

proposed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae.  While many details would need 

to be worked out and possible implications thought through, I believe it is a promising 

start.   

Another structural change that would help would be a limit on the extent to which 

servicers have to advance principal and interest on non-performing loans.  In times of 

high delinquency, this can put considerable financial strain on servicers, which can lead 

to negative consequences for consumers trying to work with those stressed servicers.  

This could be addressed by changing secondary market standards so that servicers only 

have to advance  mortgage principal and interest up to, say, 60 or 90 days beyond 

delinquency.  Alternatively, they could advance principal and interest payments only as 

they come in--a so-called “actual/actual” schedule.  Either change would affect the 

payment streams to investors, but I would imagine that participants in the secondary 

markets would be able to model with some confidence how this would affect the value of 

securities and adjust pricing accordingly. 


 - 9 - 

 This means that future pooling and servicing agreements will need to look 

different than those of the past.  They will need to be much more detailed and provide 

clarity about what the servicer can and cannot do.  They should explicitly allow for loan 

modifications and other non-foreclosure workout actions when they are determined to 

lead to a smaller loss to the investor than would a foreclosure.  There also needs to be 

clarity that the servicer is expected to work in the aggregate best interests of the investor, 

regardless of tranche.  And we need to find ways to deal with the problems that arise 

from the conflicting interests of senior and junior lien interests that can hold up workable 

alternatives to foreclosure. 

 Too many of the practices in the mortgage servicing industry have been 

developed and defended solely on the basis of “standard industry practice,” but many 

practices were not only standard but shoddy.  This has proven true, I might add, on the 

underwriting and secondary market sides of the house, and we are now seeing courts 

reject some of those practices.  More explicit rules and procedures need to replace 

standard practices.  And these rules and procedures need to be incorporated into the deals 

with investors, who will factor them in to the value they see in the securities.  

 These are some initial thoughts on how to rebuild an important but currently 

dysfunctional sector of the housing market.  Surely details need to be worked out, costs 

accounted for, and potential unintended consequences thought through.  This isn’t easy, 

and time is of the essence because the drag on our recovery is palpable.  We need the 

incentives that permit us to reengineer this sector of the market and build a business 

model that actually works.  That model will need to provide adequate and appropriate 

compensation for servicers, protect consumers, give investors what they need, and be 


 - 10 - 

sufficiently transparent to all parties and the public.  It needs to be transparent and 

accountable--one that better aligns the interests and incentives of homeowners, investors, 

and servicers.  And servicers need to understand that the homeowner is an important 

constituent, if for no other reason than that it is the homeowner who is critical to the 

revitalization of the housing sector.   

 In the process of rebuilding, we all have a significant and urgent role to play.  The 

Federal Reserve Board has acted to provide unprecedented levels of liquidity to the 

market since the crisis began through the development of an accommodative monetary 

policy and the establishment and implementation of back-stop facilities and last-resort 

lending.  We clearly need to continue thinking about obstacles that exist in the realm of 

strong mortgage lending.  There is always more that the Federal Reserve can consider in 

terms of reforms that are needed for housing finance, mortgage lending, and mortgage 

service providers.   

But the government can only do so much, and relevant private sector actors need 

to think beyond their bottom line and focus on how their firms’ actions are or are not 

contributing to the economic recovery.  I am convinced that, in order for our economic 

reconstruction to come about, it will be essential for each of us to commit to furthering 

the good of our nation, our neighborhoods, and our fellow citizens. 

 I do not want to revisit all of the sordid events that brought us to economic crisis 

in 2008 but, suffice it to say that, in the housing sector, we traveled a very low road that 

had nothing to do with looking out for the greater good.  On the contrary, there were too 

many people in all of the functional component parts--mortgage brokers, loan originators, 

loan securitizers, sub-prime lenders, Wall Street investment bankers, and rating agencies-


 - 11 - 

-who were interested only in making their own fast profits and were  indifferent to the 

consequences of their actions for homeowners and communities, much less the nation as 

a whole.  This selfish free-for-all ultimately led to an economic slide the effects of which 

are still visible in the boarded-up houses and sheriffs’ foreclosure notices posted all over 

America. 

We pulled back from the brink of depression only through a massive and 

unprecedented infusion of public dollars in the banking system, and in other systemically 

important firms, to prevent collapse.  In other words, the public was forced into a position 

where it had to put a lot on the line to save the financial system from its own follies and 

from total ruin.  And many were bitter about having to do so. 

Now, it is time to pay back the American citizenry in full, and not just in the 

literal sense, but in the sense that there must be reciprocity and mutuality in our 

structuring of economic policy so that we do not travel this low road again.  Bluntly 

stated, the government reluctantly provided the taxpayer funds necessary to unfreeze the 

financial markets and get our financial institutions on their feet again, with the 

expectation that the benefits would be directly meaningful to those taxpayers in their 

households and communities.   

The financial institutions that have been bolstered directly and indirectly by 

government subsidy and aid must now seek to support those who have been buffeted and 

injured by the housing crisis.  This must go beyond the corrective actions that need to be 

taken to rectify current deficiencies.  It means that financial institutions need to 

understand the effects their actions will have on consumers and the country as a whole, 

and factor those considerations in to their business decisions.  This is the high road--a 


 - 12 - 

moral and economic imperative that must be the driving purpose that unifies and 

animates our efforts.  Indeed, the high road demands that we become effective 

institutional innovators for positive changes in our communities and for housing practices 

that promote community well-being.  When we traveled the low road, the only question 

was:  Will this practice make me rich?  Taking the high road means we continually ask:   

Do our financial and legal arrangements contribute to the public welfare and the common 

good?   

 Yes, our economy has started to rebound, but we need a strong housing market in 

order to ensure a complete, stable, and sustainable recovery.  The meltdown in the 

housing sector set off our economic crisis, and the reconstruction of the housing sector 

will help bring it to a close.  Each of you has a role to play in this mission, and I urge you 

to embrace this challenge and to do your part to contribute to the economic rebuilding of 

our country. 

 Thank you.
