“Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the Future”

August 26, 2016 





The Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession posed daunting new challenges 

for central banks around the world and spurred innovations in the design, 

implementation, and communication of monetary policy.  With the U.S. economy now 

nearing the Federal Reserve’s statutory goals of maximum employment and price 

stability, this conference provides a timely opportunity to consider how the lessons we 

learned are likely to influence the conduct of monetary policy in the future. 

The theme of the conference, “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks 

for the Future,” encompasses many aspects of monetary policy, from the nitty-gritty 

details of implementing policy in financial markets to broader questions about how policy 

affects the economy.  Within the operational realm, key choices include the selection of 

policy instruments, the specific markets in which the central bank participates, and the 

size and structure of the central bank’s balance sheet.  These topics are of great 

importance to the Federal Reserve.  As noted in the minutes of last month’s Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, we are studying many issues related to policy 

implementation, research which ultimately will inform the FOMC’s views on how to 

most effectively conduct monetary policy in the years ahead.  I expect that the work 

discussed at this conference will make valuable contributions to the understanding of 

many of these important issues.   

My focus today will be the policy tools that are needed to ensure that we have a 

resilient monetary policy framework.  In particular, I will focus on whether our existing 

tools are adequate to respond to future economic downturns.  As I will argue, one lesson 

from the crisis is that our pre-crisis toolkit was inadequate to address the range of 

economic circumstances that we faced.  Looking ahead, we will likely need to retain

many of the monetary policy tools that were developed to promote recovery from the 

crisis.  In addition, policymakers inside and outside the Fed may wish at some point to 

consider additional options to secure a strong and resilient economy.  But before I turn to 

these longer-run issues, I would like to offer a few remarks on the near-term outlook for 

the U.S. economy and the potential implications for monetary policy. 

Current Economic Situation and Outlook   

U.S. economic activity continues to expand, led by solid growth in household 

spending.  But business investment remains soft and subdued foreign demand and the 

appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014 continue to restrain exports.  While economic 

growth has not been rapid, it has been sufficient to generate further improvement in the 

labor market.  Smoothing through the monthly ups and downs, job gains averaged 

190,000 per month over the past three months.  Although the unemployment rate has 

remained fairly steady this year, near 5 percent, broader measures of labor utilization 

have improved.  Inflation has continued to run below the FOMC’s objective of 2 percent, 

reflecting in part the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices. 

Looking ahead, the FOMC expects moderate growth in real gross domestic 

product (GDP), additional strengthening in the labor market, and inflation rising to 

2 percent over the next few years.  Based on this economic outlook, the FOMC continues 

to anticipate that gradual increases in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over time 

to achieve and sustain employment and inflation near our statutory objectives.  Indeed, in 

light of the continued solid performance of the labor market and our outlook for 

economic activity and inflation, I believe the case for an increase in the federal funds rate

has strengthened in recent months.  Of course, our decisions always depend on the degree 

to which incoming data continues to confirm the Committee’s outlook. 

And, as ever, the economic outlook is uncertain, and so monetary policy is not on 

a preset course.  Our ability to predict how the federal funds rate will evolve over time is 

quite limited because monetary policy will need to respond to whatever disturbances may 

buffet the economy.  In addition, the level of short-term interest rates consistent with the 

dual mandate varies over time in response to shifts in underlying economic conditions 

that are often evident only in hindsight.  For these reasons, the range of reasonably likely 

outcomes for the federal funds rate is quite wide--a point illustrated by figure 1 in your 

handout.  The line in the center is the median path for the federal funds rate based on the 

FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections in June.1  The shaded region, which is based 

on the historical accuracy of private and government forecasters, shows a 70 percent 

probability that the federal funds rate will be between 0 and 3-1/4 percent at the end of 

next year and between 0 and 4-1/2 percent at the end of 2018. 2  The reason for the wide 

range is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus rarely evolves as 

predicted.  When shocks occur and the economic outlook changes, monetary policy needs

FOMC meeting and is available on the Board’s website at 

www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20160615.pdf. 
2 The confidence interval equals (subject to a lower bound of 12.5 basis points) the median SEP path for the 

federal funds rate plus or minus average root mean squared prediction errors (RMSPEs) of the three-month 

Treasury bill rate, for horizons from zero to nine quarters ahead, based on forecast errors made over the 

past 20 years.  Average RMSPEs are calculated as the mean of the RMSPEs of the following forecasters, 

subject to availability for the horizon in question:  the Federal Reserve Board staff (Greenbook/Tealbook), 

the Administration, the Congressional Budget Office, the Blue Chip consensus forecast, and the Survey of 

Professional Forecasters.  Differences in predictive accuracy among these forecasters are not statistically 

significant.  For more information on the general methodology used to construct confidence intervals using 

historical forecasting errors, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of 

the Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series

to adjust.  What we do know, however, is that we want a policy toolkit that will allow us 

to respond to a wide range of possible conditions.  

The Pre-Crisis Toolkit   

Prior to the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy toolkit was 

simple but effective in the circumstances that then prevailed.  Our main tool consisted of 

open market operations to manage the amount of reserve balances available to the 

banking sector.3  These operations, in turn, influenced the interest rate in the federal 

funds market, where banks experiencing reserve shortfalls could borrow from banks with 

excess reserves.  Before the onset of the crisis, the volume of reserves was generally 

small--only about $45 billion or so.4  Thus, even small open market operations could 

have a significant effect on the federal funds rate.  Changes in the federal funds rate 

would then be transmitted to other short-term interest rates, affecting longer-term interest 

rates and overall financial conditions and hence inflation and economic activity.  This 

simple, light-touch system allowed the Federal Reserve to operate with a relatively small 

balance sheet--less than $1 trillion before the crisis--the size of which was largely 

determined by the need to supply enough U.S. currency to meet demand.5    

The global financial crisis revealed two main shortcomings of this simple toolkit.  

The first was an inability to control the federal funds rate once reserves were no longer 

                                                 
3 Open market operations at the time were primarily repurchase agreements based on Treasury securities, 

with primary dealers as counterparties. 
4 Reserves of depository institutions include vault cash and balances maintained with Federal Reserve 

Banks.  Excess reserves are the reserves held over and above required reserves.  See the Board’s webpage 

“Reserve Requirements” at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm.  
5 Prior to the financial crisis, the size of the Fed’s balance sheet was about $900 billion.  Assets consisted 

almost entirely of Treasury securities.  Liabilities included currency held by the public and a relatively 

small volume of reserve balances.  For more on the Fed’s balance sheet, see 

www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm.

relatively scarce.  Starting in late 2007, faced with acute financial market distress, the 

Federal Reserve created programs to keep credit flowing to households and businesses.6  

The loans extended under those programs helped stabilize the financial system.  But the 

additional reserves created by these programs, if left unchecked, would have pushed 

down the federal funds rate, driving it well below the FOMC’s target.  To prevent such an 

outcome, the Federal Reserve took several steps to offset (or sterilize) the effect of its 

liquidity and credit operations on reserves.7  By the fall of 2008, however, the reserve 

effects of our liquidity and credit programs threatened to become too large to sterilize via 

asset sales and other existing tools.  Without sufficient sterilization capacity, the quantity 

of reserves increased to a point that the Federal Reserve had difficulty maintaining 

effective control over the federal funds rate.   

Of course, by the end of 2008, stabilizing the federal funds rate at a level 

materially above zero was not an immediate concern because the economy clearly needed 

very low short-term interest rates.  Faced with a steep rise in unemployment and 

declining inflation, the FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero, a 

reduction of roughly 5 percentage points over the previous year and a half.  Nonetheless, 

a variety of policy benchmarks would, at least in hindsight, have called for pushing the 

                                                 
6 For information on the Federal Reserve’s credit and liquidity programs that were implemented in response 

to the financial crisis, see www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_crisisresponse.htm on the Board’s 

website.    
7 Reserves were initially taken out of the banking system by not reinvesting principal payments from 

maturing securities and later by selling portions of securities holdings.  In September 2008, the Department 

of the Treasury announced the temporary Supplementary Financing Program, in which the proceeds of a 

series of Treasury bill auctions, separate from Treasury’s routine borrowing, were maintained in an account 

at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The funds in this account served to drain reserves from the 

banking system.

federal funds rate well below zero during the economic downturn.8  That doing so was 

impossible highlights the second serious limitation of our pre-crisis policy toolkit:  its 

inability to generate substantially more accommodation than could be provided by a near-

zero federal funds rate.  

Our Expanded Toolkit   

To address the challenges posed by the financial crisis and the subsequent severe 

recession and slow recovery, the Federal Reserve significantly expanded its monetary 

policy toolkit.  In 2006, the Congress had approved plans to allow the Fed, beginning in 

2011, to pay interest on banks’ reserve balances.9  In the fall of 2008, the Congress 

moved up the effective date of this authority to October 2008.  That authority was 

essential.  Paying interest on reserve balances enables the Fed to break the strong link 

between the quantity of reserves and the level of the federal funds rate and, in turn, 

allows the Federal Reserve to control short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful.  

In particular, once economic conditions warrant a higher level for market interest rates, 

the Federal Reserve could raise the interest rate paid on excess reserves--the IOER rate.  

                                                 
8 Consider the following policy rule:  R(t) = R* + π(t) + 0.5[π(t)-π*]-2.0[U(t)-U*], where R is the federal 

funds rate, R* is the longer-run normal value of the federal funds rate adjusted for inflation, π is the four-

quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, π* is the FOMC’s target for inflation (2 percent), U is the 

unemployment rate, and U* is the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  Based on the medians of 

FOMC participants’ latest longer-run projections, R* is approximately 1 percent and U* is about 

4.8 percent.  Accordingly, with the unemployment rate climbing to 10 percent and core PCE inflation 

falling to 1 percent in 2009, this rule would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus 

9 percent at the depths of the recession.  In contrast, the standard Taylor rule, which is half as responsive to 

movements in resource utilization, would have prescribed lowering the federal funds rate to minus 

3-3/4 percent using the same estimates for R* and U*.  The more aggressive rule does a reasonably good 

job of accounting for movements in the federal funds rate in the decade prior to its falling to its effective 

lower bound in late 2008, see David Reifschneider (2016), “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond 

to Future Recessions,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-068 (Washington:  Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August), 

www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016068pap.pdf.  For more information on the 

standard Taylor rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,” Carnegie-

Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195-214. 
9 Paying interest on reserves is a tool commonly used by central banks, including the Bank of England, the 

Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank.

A higher IOER rate encourages banks to raise the interest rates they charge, putting 

upward pressure on market interest rates regardless of the level of reserves in the banking 

sector.    

While adjusting the IOER rate is an effective way to move market interest rates 

when reserves are plentiful, federal funds have generally traded below this rate.  This 

relative softness of the federal funds rate reflects, in part, the fact that only depository 

institutions can earn the IOER rate.  To put a more effective floor under short-term 

interest rates, the Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed.  For 

instance, the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility is available to a 

variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-sponsored 

enterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions.  Through it, eligible 

counterparties may invest funds overnight with the Federal Reserve at a rate determined 

by the FOMC.  Similar to the payment of IOER, the ON RRP facility discourages 

participating institutions from lending at a rate substantially below that offered by the 

Fed.10   

Our current toolkit proved effective last December.  In an environment of 

superabundant reserves, the FOMC raised the effective federal funds rate--that is, the 

weighted average rate on federal funds transactions among participants in that market--by 

the desired amount, and we have since maintained the federal funds rate in its target 

range.  

                                                 
10 Other tools that could help strengthen the floor under short-term interest rates but are not currently in use 

include the Term Deposit Facility and term reverse repurchase agreements.   


 - 8 - 

Two other major additions to the Fed’s toolkit were large-scale asset purchases 

and increasingly explicit forward guidance.11  Both were used to provide additional 

monetary policy accommodation after short-term interest rates fell close to zero.  Our 

purchases of Treasury and mortgage-related securities in the open market pushed down 

longer-term borrowing rates for millions of American families and businesses.  Extended 

forward rate guidance--announcing that we intended to keep short-term interest rates 

lower for longer than might have otherwise been expected--also put significant 

downward pressure on longer-term borrowing rates, as did guidance regarding the size 

and scope of our asset purchases.  

In light of the slowness of the economic recovery, some have questioned the 

effectiveness of asset purchases and extended forward rate guidance.  But this criticism 

fails to consider the unusual headwinds the economy faced after the crisis.  Those 

headwinds included substantial household and business deleveraging, unfavorable 

demand shocks from abroad, a period of contractionary fiscal policy, and unusually tight 

credit, especially for housing.  Studies have found that our asset purchases and extended 

forward rate guidance put appreciable downward pressure on long-term interest rates and, 

as a result, helped spur growth in demand for goods and services, lower the 

unemployment rate, and prevent inflation from falling further below our 2 percent 

objective.12  

                                                 
11 Prior to the crisis, the Fed occasionally used forward guidance pertaining to the likely future path of 

interest rates, but that guidance was usually confined to a relatively short time frame. 
12 See, for instance, Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2011), “The 

Financial Market Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale Asset Purchases,” International Journal of 

Central Banking, vol. 7 (March), pp. 3-43, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb11q1a1.htm; and Stefania D’Amico, 
William English, David López-Salido, and Edward Nelson (2012), “The Federal Reserve’s Large-Scale 

Asset Purchase Programmes:  Rationale and Effects,” Economic Journal, vol. 122 (November), pp. F415-

46.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance and asset purchase policies have been estimated to 


 - 9 - 

Two of the Fed’s most important new tools--our authority to pay interest on 

excess reserves and our asset purchases--interacted importantly.  Without IOER 

authority, the Federal Reserve would have been reluctant to buy as many assets as it did 

because of the longer-run implications for controlling the stance of monetary policy.  

While we were buying assets aggressively to help bring the U.S. economy out of a severe 

recession, we also had to keep in mind whether and how we would be able to remove 

monetary policy accommodation when appropriate.  That issue was particularly relevant 

because we fund our asset purchases through the creation of reserves, and those 

additional reserves would have made it ever more difficult for the pre-crisis toolkit to 

raise short-term interest rates when needed.  

The FOMC considered removing accommodation by first reducing our asset 

holdings (including through asset sales) and raising the federal funds rate only after our 

balance sheet had contracted substantially.  But we decided against this approach because 

our ability to predict the effects of changes in the balance sheet on the economy is less 

than that associated with changes in the federal funds rate.  Excessive inflationary 

pressures could arise if assets were sold too slowly.  Conversely, financial markets and 

the economy could potentially be destabilized if assets were sold too aggressively.  

Indeed, the so-called taper tantrum of 2013 illustrates the difficulty of predicting financial 

market reactions to announcements about the balance sheet.  Given the uncertainty and 

potential costs associated with large-scale asset sales, the FOMC instead decided to begin 

                                                 
have helped lower unemployment and boost inflation; see Eric M. Engen, Thomas Laubach, and David 

Reifschneider (2015), “The Macroeconomic Effects of the Federal Reserve’s Unconventional Monetary 

Policies,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2015-005 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the 

Federal Reserve System, January), http://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2015.005.

removing monetary policy accommodation primarily by adjusting short-term interest 

rates rather than by actively managing its asset holdings.13  That strategy--raising short-

term interest rates once the recovery was sufficiently advanced while maintaining a 

relatively large balance sheet and plentiful bank reserves--depended on our ability to pay 

interest on excess reserves.   

Where Do We Go from Here?  

What does the future hold for the Fed’s toolkit?  For starters, our ability to use 

interest on reserves is likely to play a key role for years to come.  In part, this reflects the 

outlook for our balance sheet over the next few years.  As the FOMC has noted in its 

recent statements, at some point after the process of raising the federal funds rate is well 

under way, we will cease or phase out reinvesting repayments of principal from our 

securities holdings.  Once we stop reinvestment, it should take several years for our asset 

holdings--and the bank reserves used to finance them--to passively decline to a more 

normal level.  But even after the volume of reserves falls substantially, IOER will still be 

important as a contingency tool, because we may need to purchase assets during future 

recessions to supplement conventional interest rate reductions.14  Forecasts now show the 

                                                 
13 The FOMC’s “Policy Normalization Principles and Plans” call for reducing the Federal Reserve’s 

securities holdings in a “gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing to reinvest repayments of 

principal on securities held in the [System Open Market Account]” (Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement on Policy Normalization Principles and 

Plans,” press release, September 17, second bullet, 

www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20140917c.htm). Consistent with those plans, the 

Federal Open Market Committee anticipates that it will maintain its current reinvestment strategy “until 

normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” (for instance, see Board of Governors 

of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press release, 

December 16, paragraph 5, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20151216a.htm. 
14 If the FOMC were to again increase the size of the balance sheet markedly in response to a future 

recession, then the ability to pay interest on reserves could be critical during the subsequent recovery period 

to help control short-term interest rates while the balance sheet remains elevated.  Beyond this motivation 

for retaining IOER, the ability to pay interest on reserves could also be important to the operation of any 

special liquidity and credit facilities that might be created to deal with systemic disruptions to the financial

federal funds rate settling at about 3 percent in the longer run.15  In contrast, the federal 

funds rate averaged more than 7 percent between 1965 and 2000.  Thus, we expect to 

have less scope for interest rate cuts than we have had historically.     

In part, current expectations for a low future federal funds rate reflect the 

FOMC’s success in stabilizing inflation at around 2 percent--a rate much lower than rates 

that prevailed during the 1970s and 1980s.  Another key factor is the marked decline over 

the past decade, both here and abroad, in the long-run neutral real rate of interest--that is, 

the inflation-adjusted short-term interest rate consistent with keeping output at its 

potential on average over time.16  Several developments could have contributed to this 

apparent decline, including slower growth in the working-age populations of many 

countries, smaller productivity gains in the advanced economies, a decreased propensity 

to spend in the wake of the financial crises around the world since the late 1990s, and 

                                                 
system during a future emergency.  In particular, such facilities could significantly expand the supply of 

reserves, which would be problematic if the FOMC wished to keep short-term interest rates from falling to 

zero.   
15 In the Blue Chip Financial Indicators survey released on June 1, 2016, the consensus forecast for the 

longer-run level of the federal funds rate was 3.2 percent.  FOMC participants in June 2016 generally 

anticipated a slightly lower longer-run level, in that the median of their individual forecasts was 3 percent 

(see table 1 of the June 2016 SEP, available at 

www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20160615ep.htm).  The latest long-run forecast from 

the Administration (www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2016/assets/16msr.pdf) is also 

close to 3 percent, as was the projection made by the Congressional Budget Office earlier in the year (see 

www.cbo.gov/about/products/budget_economic_data). 
16 Updated estimates from the model developed by Laubach and Williams (2003) indicate that the real 

long-run neutral or “equilibrium” short-term interest rate in the United States is currently about 

2-1/2 percentage points lower than it was on average in the 1980s and 1990s (see Thomas Laubach and 

John C. Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, 

vol. 85 (November), pp. 1063-70; updated estimates are available at www.frbsf.org/economic-

research/economists/john-williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.)  In addition, Holston, 

Laubach, and Williams (2016) find significant but somewhat smaller declines in equilibrium rates for the 

euro area, Canada, and the United Kingdom (see Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams 

(2016), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest:  International Trends and Determinants,” Working Paper 

2016-11 (San Francisco:  Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, June), www.frbsf.org/economic-

perhaps a paucity of attractive capital projects worldwide.17  Although these factors may 

help explain why bond yields have fallen to such low levels here and abroad, our 

understanding of the forces driving long-run trends in interest rates is nevertheless 

limited, and thus all predictions in this area are highly uncertain.18   

Would an average federal funds rate of about 3 percent impair the Fed’s ability to 

fight recessions?  Based on the FOMC’s behavior in past recessions, one might think that 

such a low interest rate could substantially impair policy effectiveness.  As shown in the 

first column of the table in the handout, during the past nine recessions, the FOMC cut 

the federal funds rate by amounts ranging from about 3 percentage points to more than 

10 percentage points.  On average, the FOMC reduced rates by about 5-1/2 percentage 

points, which seems to suggest that the FOMC would face a shortfall of about 

2-1/2 percentage points for dealing with an average-sized recession.  But this simple 

comparison exaggerates the limitations on policy created by the zero lower bound.  As 

shown in the second column, the federal funds rate at the start of the past seven 

recessions was appreciably above the level consistent with the economy operating at 

potential in the longer run.  In most cases, this tighter-than-normal stance of policy before

the recession appears to have reflected some combination of initially higher-than-normal 

labor utilization and elevated inflation pressures.  As a result, a large portion of the rate 

cuts that subsequently occurred during these recessions represented the undoing of the 

earlier tight stance of monetary policy.  Of course, this situation could occur again in the 

future.  But if it did, the federal funds rate at the onset of the recession would be well 

above its normal level, and the FOMC would be able to cut short-term interest rates by 

substantially more than 3 percentage points.   

A recent paper takes a different approach to assessing the FOMC’s ability to 

respond to future recessions by using simulations of the FRB/US model.19  This analysis 

begins by asking how the economy would respond to a set of highly adverse shocks if 

policymakers followed a fairly aggressive policy rule, hypothetically assuming that they 

can cut the federal funds rate without limit.20  It then imposes the zero lower bound and 

asks whether some combination of forward guidance and asset purchases would be 

sufficient to generate economic conditions at least as good as those that occur under the 

                                                 
19 FRB/US model simulations have several advantages for analyzing this issue.  For one, the model’s 

structure allows the public’s expectations for interest rates, inflation, and other factors to take full account 

of the implications of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, changes in future monetary 

policy as signaled by forward guidance, and asset purchases.  In addition, the model incorporates the low 

responsiveness of inflation to movements in resource utilization seen in recent years as well as the effects 

of asset purchases on term premiums, and thus a variety of longer-term interest rates, equity prices, and the 

foreign exchange value of the dollar.  For a further discussion about the advantages (and possible 

disadvantages) of using the FRB/US model to study this issue, see Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of 

the FOMC to Respond to Future Recessions,“ in note 8. 
20 The aggressive rule is R(t) = 1.0 + π(t) + 0.5 [π(t)-2] - 2.0 [U(t) - 4.8], where R is the federal funds rate, 

π is the four-quarter moving average of core PCE inflation, and U is the unemployment rate [Note:  On 

August 30, 2016, a typo in the equation for the aggressive rule was corrected to change “[4.8 - U(t)]” to 

“[U(t) - 4.8]”].  Note that baseline values of the equilibrium real rate, the natural rate of unemployment, and 

the target rate of inflation used in the simulation analysis--1.0 percent, 4.8 percent, and 2.0 percent, 

respectively--are consistent with the medians of the latest long-run projections of individual FOMC 

participants.  As discussed by Taylor (1999), this rule appears to do a good job in stabilizing real activity 

and inflation in a wide range of economic models (see John B. Taylor (1999), “Introduction,” in John B. 

Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press), pp. 1-14).

hypothetical unconstrained policy.  In general, the study concludes that, even if the 

average level of the federal funds rate in the future is only 3 percent, these new tools 

should be sufficient unless the recession were to be unusually severe and persistent.   

Figure 2 in your handout illustrates this point.  It shows simulated paths for 

interest rates, the unemployment rate, and inflation under three different monetary policy 

responses--the aggressive rule in the absence of the zero lower bound constraint, the 

constrained aggressive rule, and the constrained aggressive rule combined with $2 trillion 

in asset purchases and guidance that the federal funds rate will depart from the rule by 

staying lower for longer.21  As the red dashed line shows, the federal funds rate would fall 

far below zero if policy were unconstrained, thereby causing long-term interest rates to 

fall sharply.i  But despite the lower bound, asset purchases and forward guidance can 

push long-term interest rates even lower on average than in the unconstrained case 

(especially when adjusted for inflation) by reducing term premiums and increasing the 

downward pressure on the expected average value of future short-term interest rates.  

Thus, the use of such tools could result in even better outcomes for unemployment and 

inflation on average.   

Of course, this analysis could be too optimistic.  For one, the FRB/US simulations 

may overstate the effectiveness of forward guidance and asset purchases, particularly in 

an environment where long-term interest rates are also likely to be unusually low.22  In 

                                                 
21 The forward guidance is provided at the start of the recession and has three components.  First, the 

federal funds rate will be lowered to zero more quickly than prescribed by the rule.  Second, the federal 

funds rate will remain at zero as long as the unemployment rate is greater than 5 percent.  And, finally, that 

after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, policymakers will proceed gradually in returning to the 

prescriptions of the policy rule.    
22 As shown in figure 2, the 10-year Treasury yield in the simulation starts out at just over 4 percent, well 

below its level pre-crisis, suggesting that there may be less room to push down long-term interest rates in 

the future than in the past.  Another potential source of overstatement could be the FRB/US assumption that

addition, policymakers could have less ability to cut short-term interest rates in the future 

than the simulations assume.  By some calculations, the real neutral rate is currently close 

to zero, and it could remain at this low level if we were to continue to see slow 

productivity growth and high global saving.23  If so, then the average level of the nominal 

federal funds rate down the road might turn out to be only 2 percent, implying that asset 

purchases and forward guidance might have to be pushed to extremes to compensate.24  

Moreover, relying too heavily on these nontraditional tools could have unintended 

consequences.  For example, if future policymakers responded to a severe recession by 

announcing their intention to keep the federal funds rate near zero for a very long time 

after the economy had substantially recovered and followed through on that guidance, 

then they might inadvertently encourage excessive risk-taking and so undermine financial 

stability.     

Finally, the simulation analysis certainly overstates the FOMC’s current ability to 

respond to a recession, given that there is little scope to cut the federal funds rate at the 

                                                 
changes in long-term interest rates, whether driven by shifts in term premiums or shifts in the expected path 

of short-term interest rates, have the same influence on real activity, as there is some empirical evidence 

that the estimated sensitivity of spending to movements in term premiums alone may be relatively small; 

see Michael T. Kiley (2014), “The Aggregate Demand Effects of Short- and Long-Term Interest Rates,” 

International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (December), pp. 69-104, 

www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q4a3.pdf.  On the other hand, the effectiveness of forward guidance in the 

FRB/US model is materially less than it is in some other models, implying that the FRB/US simulation 

results could potentially understate the stimulus provided by the announcement of a lower-for-longer 

policy.  See Hess Chung (2015), “The Effects of Forward Guidance in Three Macro Models,” FEDS Notes 

(Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February 26), 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2015/effects-of-forward-guidance-in-three-

macro-models-20150226.html. 
23 In principle, the federal funds rate in the longer run could also turn out to be lower than currently 

predicted if inflation were to remain persistently below 2 percent.  However, because a higher rate of 

inflation can arguably be achieved over time through a sufficiently tight labor market, this risk seems low 

to me as long as the Federal Reserve is committed to achieving its inflation objective. 
24 In the simulations reported by Reifschneider, “Gauging the Ability of the FOMC to Respond to Future 

Recessions,” in note 8, overcoming the effects of the zero lower bound during a severe recession would 

require about $4 trillion in asset purchases and pledging to stay low for even longer if the average future 

level of the federal funds rate is only 2 percent.

moment.  But that does not mean that the Federal Reserve would be unable to provide 

appreciable accommodation should the ongoing expansion falter in the near term.  In 

addition to taking the federal funds rate back down to nearly zero, the FOMC could 

resume asset purchases and announce its intention to keep the federal funds rate at this 

level until conditions had improved markedly--although with long-term interest rates 

already quite low, the net stimulus that would result might be somewhat reduced. 

Despite these caveats, I expect that forward guidance and asset purchases will 

remain important components of the Fed’s policy toolkit.  In addition, it is critical that the 

Federal Reserve and other supervisory agencies continue to do all they can to ensure a 

strong and resilient financial system.  That said, these tools are not a panacea, and future 

policymakers could find that they are not adequate to deal with deep and prolonged 

economic downturns.  For these reasons, policymakers and society more broadly may 

want to explore additional options for helping to foster a strong economy. 

On the monetary policy side, future policymakers might choose to consider some 

additional tools that have been employed by other central banks, though adding them to 

our toolkit would require a very careful weighing of costs and benefits and, in some 

cases, could require legislation.  For example, future policymakers may wish to explore 

the possibility of purchasing a broader range of assets.  Beyond that, some observers have 

suggested raising the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective or implementing policy 

through alternative monetary policy frameworks, such as price-level or nominal GDP 

targeting.  I should stress, however, that the FOMC is not actively considering these 

additional tools and policy frameworks, although they are important subjects for research.

Beyond monetary policy, fiscal policy has traditionally played an important role 

in dealing with severe economic downturns.  A wide range of possible fiscal policy tools 

and approaches could enhance the cyclical stability of the economy.25  For example, steps 

could be taken to increase the effectiveness of the automatic stabilizers, and some 

economists have proposed that greater fiscal support could be usefully provided to state 

and local governments during recessions.  As always, it would be important to ensure that 

any fiscal policy changes did not compromise long-run fiscal sustainability.     

Finally, and most ambitiously, as a society we should explore ways to raise 

productivity growth.  Stronger productivity growth would tend to raise the average level 

of interest rates and therefore would provide the Federal Reserve with greater scope to 

ease monetary policy in the event of a recession.  But more importantly, stronger 

productivity growth would enhance Americans’ living standards.  Though outside the 

narrow field of monetary policy, many possibilities in this arena are worth considering, 

including improving our educational system and investing more in worker training; 

promoting capital investment and research spending, both private and public; and looking 

for ways to reduce regulatory burdens while protecting important economic, financial, 

and social goals.

Although fiscal policies and structural reforms can play an important role in 

strengthening the U.S. economy, my primary message today is that I expect monetary 

policy will continue to play a vital part in promoting a stable and healthy economy.  New 

policy tools, which helped the Federal Reserve respond to the financial crisis and Great 

Recession, are likely to remain useful in dealing with future downturns.  Additional tools 

may be needed and will be the subject of research and debate.  But even if average 

interest rates remain lower than in the past, I believe that monetary policy will, under 

most conditions, be able to respond effectively.
