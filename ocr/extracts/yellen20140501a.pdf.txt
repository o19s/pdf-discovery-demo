2014 Washington Policy Summit

May 1, 2014


 Thank you for inviting me to ICBA’s policy summit.  I am pleased to have this 

opportunity to share my views on some of the key issues facing community banks and how I see 

the community banking model fitting into the financial system in the years ahead.  In particular, I 

will discuss steps the Federal Reserve has taken to address the “too-big-to-fail” problem and how 

these steps affect community banks; I will describe how the Fed strives to improve our 

understanding of the unique role that community banks play in the economy; and then I’ll show 

how we are using this knowledge to better tailor our supervisory expectations and approaches to 

community banks. 

 As you may know, before I rejoined the Federal Reserve Board as Vice Chair in 2010, I 

had the privilege of serving for six years as president and chief executive of the Federal Reserve 

Bank of San Francisco.  The 12th district is the largest of the Fed’s districts, covering nine 

western states, and it is home to a significant number of community banks, the majority of which 

are supervised by the San Francisco Fed directly or indirectly through bank holding companies.  

Community bankers helped me, when I served as president, to take the pulse of the local 

economy and also to understand how regulatory and policy decisions in Washington affect 

financial institutions of different sizes and types, sometimes in very different ways.  During the 

financial crisis, I saw firsthand the challenges that community banks faced in a crisis they did 

little to cause, and I have felt strongly ever since that the Fed must do what it can to ensure that 

the actions taken following the crisis do not place undue burdens on your institutions.   

 I believe a healthy financial system relies on institutions of different sizes performing a 

variety of functions and serving different needs.  In some communities, your banks are actually 

situated on Main Street, but all community banks serve Main Street by providing credit to small 

business owners, homebuyers, households, and farmers.

Because of their important role, I am pleased that the condition of many community 

banks has been improving.  Although there is still considerable revenue pressure from low 

margins, earnings for most community banks have rebounded since the financial crisis.  Asset 

quality and capital ratios continue to improve, and the number of problem banks continues to 

decline.  Notably, after several years of reduced lending following the recession, we are starting 

to see slow but steady loan growth at community banks.  While this expansion in lending must 

be prudent, on balance I consider this growth an encouraging sign of an improving economy.   

Addressing Too Big to Fail 

Let me begin by discussing an issue that I know has been on the minds of many 

community bankers:  how policymakers are addressing the problem of banks that are perceived 

to be too big to fail.1  Community banks share the interest we all have in reducing the systemic 

risk posed by firms that are large, complex, and interconnected, and also in reducing any 

potential competitive advantages that such firms may enjoy as a result of too-big-to-fail.  

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) 

addresses the too-big-to-fail issue through steps intended to limit both the likelihood that 

systemically important firms would fail and the potential damage from any that do.  The Federal 

Reserve and the other financial regulatory agencies have issued a number of regulations to 

implement the requirements set forth in the legislation and to enhance the supervision of the 

largest financial firms.   

                                                 
1 This topic has been addressed in greater detail in previous speeches by Federal Reserve governors, including 
Daniel K. Tarullo (2013), “Evaluating Progress in Regulatory Reforms to Promote Financial Stability,” speech 
delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, May 3; Jerome H. Powell (2013), 
“Ending ‘Too Big to Fail,’” speech delivered at the Institute of International Bankers 2013 Washington Conference, 
Washington, March 4; and Janet L. Yellen (2013), “Regulatory Landscapes: A U.S. Perspective,” speech delivered 
at the International Monetary Conference, Shanghai, June 3. These speeches are available at

But even before Dodd-Frank became law, the Federal Reserve began to strengthen its 

oversight of the largest, most complex banking firms and require these firms to materially 

improve their capital adequacy.  For example, in 2009, we conducted the first stress tests of the 

largest 19 U.S. bank holding companies.  That test has subsequently evolved into our annual 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, known as CCAR, which requires all bank holding 

companies with total assets of $50 billion or more to submit annual capital plans for review by 

the Federal Reserve.  CCAR helps ensure that the largest banking organizations will have 

enough capital to continue operating through times of economic and financial stress.2  To be 

clear, as the federal banking agencies have stated previously, these stress testing and capital 

planning requirements do not, and should not, apply to community banks.3  

In addition to strengthening requirements for stress testing and capital planning, the 

agencies have also strengthened capital requirements for the largest firms by approving more 

robust risk-based and leverage capital requirements.  Because the financial crisis demonstrated 

the importance of having adequate levels of high-quality capital at banks of all sizes, many 

elements of the revised capital framework apply to all banking organizations.  In designing the 

revised capital rules, however, the agencies considered financial stability risks and adjusted the 

                                                 
2 The results of the 2014 CCAR exercise are available on the Federal Reserve’s website.  Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2014), “Federal Reserve Releases Results of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 
(CCAR),” press release, March 26, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140326a.htm.  

     Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies require banking 
organizations with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to conduct annual company-run 
stress tests.  The agencies recently published guidance to clarify supervisory expectations for these firms.  See Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board of Governors), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 
and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) (2014), “Agencies Issue Final Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test 
Guidance for Medium-Sized Firms,” press release, March 5,

final rules to make the requirements substantially more rigorous for the largest, most 

systemically important banking organizations than for community banks.4   

While we have taken a number of steps to address too-big-to-fail concerns, our work is 

not finished.  Because the failure of a systemic institution could impose significant costs on the 

financial system and the economy, the Board recently finalized a requirement for the eight large, 

globally systemic banks to meet a significantly higher leverage requirement than other banking 

organizations.  And we are working to implement risk-based capital surcharges for these 

systemically important firms.  We also need to ensure that the new rules are embedded in our 

supervision of the largest firms; and, we must continue to watch for emerging sources of 

systemic risk and take steps as appropriate to address these risks.   

One such risk that the Federal Reserve has been monitoring closely is the reliance of 

some firms on potentially volatile short-term wholesale funding.5  We are carefully considering 

the systemic vulnerabilities that may be posed by overreliance on short-term wholesale funding 

and are weighing potential policy responses.  While it would be premature to indicate whether or 

how we might address these vulnerabilities, I can say that few, if any, community banks are 

reliant on levels of short-term wholesale funding that could raise concerns about systemic risk, 

and regulators would carefully consider the ramifications of any action, including the effect on 

community banks. 

                                                 
4 To help non-complex community banking organizations better understand the new capital rule, the agencies 
published a guide that summarizes changes to the capital rules for exposures commonly held by such organizations.

of Governors, FDIC, and OCC, July),

Improving Our Understanding of Community Banks 

In carefully considering how our actions affect community banks, the Federal Reserve is 

committed to understanding your institutions and the challenges you face.  We continue to try to 

improve that understanding in two important ways--research and outreach.  The Fed is uniquely 

positioned to employ these two methods because of our traditional strength as a research 

institution and because of our structure, with Reserve Banks that have deep roots in communities 

in every region of the country.  

In the past several years, research staff across the Federal Reserve System who were 

independently exploring issues related to community banking have developed an informal 

network to share findings and identify areas for further research.  After some of the fruits of this 

effort were shared with the Board, we decided to join with the Conference of State Bank 

Supervisors (CSBS) to host a research and policy conference focused on community banks.  This 

conference, “Community Banking in the 21st Century,” was held in October 2013 at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of St. Louis.6   It was one of very few research conferences to focus specifically 

on community banks and also brought together researchers, community bankers, policymakers, 

and bank supervisors to discuss the practical implications of the papers presented.   

Among the topics that researchers addressed in their papers were the link between bank 

failures and local economic performance,7 the role of management in the performance of

community banks,8 and the impact of Dodd-Frank on community banks.9  I’m pleased to say that 

the conference was so successful that the Federal Reserve and CSBS are planning another in 

September.10   

In addition to research, our understanding of community banks is enhanced by the Fed’s 

outreach to community bankers.  At the most basic level, supervisory staff at each Reserve Bank 

gain insights from their regular contact with community bankers.  Additional knowledge comes 

by way of community outreach initiatives, which provide the added benefit of informing the Fed 

about local economic conditions.   Here in Washington, in addition to participating in events like 

this one, the Board of Governors meets twice a year with the Community Depository Institutions 

Advisory Council (CDIAC).11 The council, which includes representatives from small banks, 

credit unions, and savings associations from each Federal Reserve district, provides information 

about economic conditions around the country and those issues that are of greatest concern to 

community institutions.   

In addition, we have been taking steps to improve our communication with community 

bankers.  In that regard, we have been using various platforms to go beyond formal policy 

issuances and better explain our supervisory expectations for community banks.  We have also

developed and continue to enhance our industry training efforts.  In particular, we have 

developed two programs--Ask the Fed and Outlook Live--that have become quite popular with 

community bankers who are interested in learning more about topics that are of importance to 

both banks and supervisors.  Ask the Fed is a program for officials of state member banks, bank 

and thrift holding companies, and state bank commissioners.  Outlook Live, which is a 

companion program to the Federal Reserve’s quarterly Consumer Compliance Outlook 

publication, is a webinar series on consumer compliance issues that is led by Federal Reserve 

staff.12   

We are also now using periodic newsletters and other communication tools to highlight 

information that community bankers may be interested in knowing and to provide information on 

how examiners will assess compliance with Federal Reserve policies.  In addition to Consumer 

Compliance Outlook, in 2012 the Federal Reserve System established a Community Banking 

Connections website and quarterly newsletter to focus on safety-and-soundness issues that are of 

practical interest to community bankers and bank board members.13  The Federal Reserve also 

launched a series of special-purpose publications called FedLinks.14  These publications 

highlight key elements of specific supervisory topics and discuss how examiners will typically 

address the topic.  The common goal for all of these outreach efforts is building and sustaining 

an ongoing dialogue with community bankers.

Tailored Community Bank Supervision 

One theme that has come through loud and clear in this outreach is concern about 

regulatory burden.  The financial crisis has prompted significant changes to regulation, so the 

Federal Reserve understands this concern and strives to minimize regulatory burden for all 

institutions, including community banks.  At the same time, we are taking a fresh look at how we 

supervise community banks and possible ways that supervision can be smarter, more nimble, and 

more effective.  In that regard, and consistent with my earlier points about too big to fail, we 

know that a one-size-fits-all approach to supervision is often not appropriate.  In recent years, we 

have taken a number of actions to tailor supervisory expectations to the size and complexity of 

the banking organizations we supervise.    

The first step is taking a disciplined approach to judging which supervisory policies 

should apply to community banking organizations.  This involves not only weighing the costs 

and benefits of proposed rules and their implementation, but in some cases also asking whether it 

makes sense for a specific policy to apply to community banks.   

In other cases, it may not make sense to exclude community banking organizations 

entirely from the scope of a supervisory policy, but we may be able to scale expectations to the 

size and complexity of the supervisory portfolio, to minimize the burden where possible and 

appropriate.  The final capital rules for community banks that I mentioned earlier illustrate this 

kind of tailoring.  

Let me turn now to upcoming changes in the accounting standard for credit losses on 

loans and securities.  We have heard the concern that overly complex accounting rules in this 

area would increase costs with little benefit for the users of community bank financial 

statements.  We are working with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to help 


- 9 - 
 

ensure that the new standard, which is an important component of financial reform efforts, can 

be implemented in a reasonable and practical way for community banks.  We have stressed to 

FASB that its proposal should not require community banks to utilize complex modeling 

processes.  We expect that a final standard will permit loss-estimation techniques that build upon 

current credit-risk management techniques used by community banks.15  We will work with 

community banks to help implement the new standard when it is final.  In addition, our 

supervisory guidance will emphasize that regulatory expectations for implementation of the 

standard will differ based on bank size and complexity.   

 In addition to tailoring our rules, we are also taking steps to tailor and improve our 

examination processes to be more efficient and effective.  For example, we are currently in the 

process of developing and adopting common technology tools across the Federal Reserve System 

that should allow our examiners to more effectively focus their time and enhance the consistency 

of our examination processes nationwide.   

Furthermore, we are exploring ways that our community bank examiners may be able to 

complete more examination work off site.  For example, for banks that have electronic loan files, 

examiners may be able to read these files off site rather than on the bank premises.  We are also 

seeking ways to utilize the financial information that we collect from banks to tailor the 

examination procedures that are used on site, with less work being required at institutions with

lower risk profiles.  These efforts should reduce the disruption that an on-site examination can 

cause to a bank’s day-to-day operations.   

We recently adopted a new consumer compliance examination framework for community 

banks.16  Under this new program, our consumer compliance examiners base examination 

intensity more explicitly on the individual community bank’s risk profile, weighed against the 

effectiveness of the bank’s compliance controls.  We expect that examiners will spend less time 

on low-risk compliance issues at community banks, increasing the efficiency of our supervision 

and reducing regulatory burden on many community banks.   

Much of the work to tailor our supervisory requirements and programs is being overseen 

by the community bank subcommittee of the Board’s Committee on Bank Supervision.  This 

subcommittee oversees the supervision of community and regional banks and reviews proposed 

supervisory policies to help ensure that they are appropriate for, and tailored to, community 

banks.  This subcommittee was formed several years ago under the direction of now former 

governors Betsy Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin, and I want to assure you that the subcommittee 

will continue to play an important role in helping ensure that our supervisory policies make sense 

for community banks.  I should also add that we are working closely with our colleagues at the 

state level to help ensure that our supervisory approaches and methodologies are as consistent as 

possible.

 In closing, let me repeat my strong belief that community banks will continue to play an 

important role in our financial system in the years ahead, serving the credit needs of the 

communities they are a part of and know so well.  The Federal Reserve will continue to promote 

a stronger and more resilient financial system, while carefully considering the effects of our 

actions on community banks and tailoring supervision appropriately.  

Thank you.
