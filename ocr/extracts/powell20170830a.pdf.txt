Good morning.  Thank you to President Evans for inviting me to speak here today about 

the role of boards of directors of large banking firms.1  Ten years ago this month, the world 

witnessed the first tremors of what we now think of as the Global Financial Crisis and the 

subsequent Great Recession.  For the United States and many other countries, this would turn out 

to be the most painful economic period since the Great Depression.  

In the wake of the crisis, governments around the world instituted a wide range of 

reforms that were designed to reduce the likelihood and severity of a recurrence.  In the United 

States, the core elements of those reforms included significantly higher capital standards; new 

liquidity requirements; forward-looking stress tests; and resolution planning.  Our largest 

banking firms are without question much stronger than before the crisis.  We are nearing 

completion of the major parts of this reform program, and are undertaking a thorough review to 

help assure that the reforms we put in place are both effective and efficient.2   

During the crisis, some large banking firms incurred massive losses. Some of these losses 

were from products – such as super-senior collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) or structured 

investment vehicles (SIVs) – whose risks were not even on the radar screen of the firm’s board 

of directors.  After the crisis, the Federal Reserve significantly raised our expectations for the 

boards of directors of large banking firms.  Taking risk in service of clients is an essential part of 

the business of banking, including credit risk, interest rate risk, and various forms of operational 

risk.  Our reforms were designed to assure that boards of directors understand and approve the 

                                                           
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System.

strategy of the company and the risks inherent in that strategy, and that the institution has the 

capital, liquidity, and risk management capabilities necessary to manage those risks.   

Today, the role of a director of a large banking firm is more expansive, more challenging, 

and more important than ever.  Boards now oversee management’s participation in highly 

challenging annual exercises, such as stress testing, capital planning, and resolution planning, 

that have fundamentally changed the business of our largest institutions.  Boards now more 

carefully evaluate the compensation practices of these large institutions to assure that they 

reinforce positive incentives and discourage unwanted risk taking.  Across a range of 

responsibilities, we simply expect much more of boards of directors than ever before.  There is 

no reason to expect that to change.   

We do take seriously our obligation to assess whether our reforms are achieving their 

desired effects, without imposing unnecessary burden.  In 2014, we began a review of these 

higher expectations for directors.  We found that many boards have significantly improved their 

practices.  We also found some ways to make our reforms both more effective and more 

efficient.  For example, while directors generally say that they understand and embrace their 

more challenging responsibilities, we consistently hear that directors feel buried in hundreds or 

even thousands of pages of highly granular information, to the point where more important 

strategic issues are crowded out of board deliberations.  Some of this granular information was 

likely driven by our supervisory guidance, which included specific expectations not only for the 

management of the institution, but also for the board of directors.  Over time, this guidance has 

increased the number of specific directives aimed at boards well into the hundreds, which may 

have fostered a “check-the-box” approach by boards.

There is also a widespread feeling that our supervision seems to have downplayed the 

difference in roles between boards and management.  Our current ratings system for bank 

holding companies, which for large banking firms would be replaced by the currently proposed 

LFI ratings system, refers to the “board and senior management” as a subcomponent rating of 

risk management.3  We have also combined the roles of the board and senior management in 

many of our supervisory feedback letters.    

 After careful consideration, last month we proposed a new framework for our oversight 

of boards.4  In formulating this proposal, we had discussions with academics, consultants, legal 

practitioners, and directors of banking firms.   

Let me start by saying what the new approach will not do.  We do not intend that these 

reforms will lower the bar for boards or lighten the loads of directors.  The new approach 

distinguishes the board from senior management so that we can spotlight our expectations of 

effective boards.  The intent is to enable directors to spend less board time on routine matters and 

more on core board responsibilities:  overseeing management as they devise a clear and coherent 

direction for the firm, holding management accountable for the execution of that strategy, and 

ensuring the independence and stature of the risk management and internal audit functions.  

These were all areas that were found wanting in the financial crisis, and it is essential that boards 

get these fundamentals right.  

Our new proposal will move to a principles-based approach.  We have identified five 

common attributes that effective boards should exhibit, and for which we will have high 

expectations.  This principles-based approach recognizes that large firms have a broad range of

business models, structures, and practices.   While we want to be clear about our expectations, 

we also want to give directors the flexibility to meet them in a manner that works for their 

particular boards.  

First, an effective board should guide the development of a clear and coherent strategy 

for the firm and set the types and levels of risks it is willing to take.  Alignment of business 

strategy and risk appetite should minimize the firm’s exposure to large and unexpected losses.  In 

addition, the firm’s risk management capabilities need to be commensurate with the risks it 

expects to take. 

Second, an effective board should actively manage its information flow and deliberations, 

so that the board can make sound, well-informed decisions that take into account risks and 

opportunities.   

Third, an effective board should hold senior management accountable for implementing 

the firm’s strategy and risk appetite and maintaining the firm’s risk management and control 

framework.   

Fourth, an effective board should ensure the independence and stature of the independent 

risk management and internal audit functions.  It is difficult to overstate the importance of this.  

Risk management systems and controls may discourage or limit certain revenue-generating 

opportunities.  Failure to ensure the independence of these functions from the revenue generators 

and risk takers has been shown to be dangerous, and this is something for which the board is 

accountable. 

Finally, an effective board should have a composition, governance structure, and set of 

established practices that are appropriate in light of the firm’s size, complexity, scope of 

operations, and risk profile.  Boards need to be aware of their own strengths and weaknesses, and

to ensure that directors bring an appropriately diverse range of skills, knowledge, experience, and 

perspective.  Significant events, such as an unexpected loss or compliance failure, should cause 

boards to reflect and reassess their structure, composition, and processes.  An effective board 

takes a preventative approach and engages in probing self-assessments regularly and 

systematically. 

Before I conclude, let me say a few words about an aspect of the proposal that has 

attracted some attention, which is the reversal of a relatively recent practice of directing all 

examination and inspection findings--what we call “matters requiring attention” (MRAs) and 

“matters requiring immediate attention” (MRIAs)--to the board as well as to management.5  The 

practice resulted in boards of directors reviewing and signing off on management’s compliance 

with every MRA and MRIA.  When we began that practice in 2013, our intention was to ensure 

that directors were in a position to hold management accountable in addressing risk management 

shortcomings.  By 2014, we realized that the practice was “almost surely distracting from 

strategic and risk-related analyses and oversight by boards”.6  For perspective, a large banking 

firm may have one hundred or more MRAs outstanding at a given time, many of which are at a 

                                                           
5 MRIAs are matters of significant importance and urgency that the Federal Reserve requires banking organizations 
to address immediately and include, for example, matters that have the potential to pose significant risk to the safety 
and soundness of the banking organization, matters that represent significant noncompliance with applicable laws or 
regulations and repeat criticisms that have escalated in importance due to insufficient attention or inaction by the 
banking organization. MRAs, on the other hand, are matters that are important and that the Federal Reserve is 
expecting a banking organization to address over a reasonable period of time, but when the timing need not be 
“immediate.” See Supervision and Regulation (SR) letter 13-13/Consumer Affairs letter 13-10, “Supervisory 
Considerations for the Communication of Supervisory Findings,” at 
www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1313.htm. 

6 See “Corporate Governance and Prudential Regulation,” remarks by Governor Daniel J. Tarullo at Association of 
American Law Schools Midyear Meeting, June 9, 2014. (“We should probably be somewhat more selective in 
creating the regulatory checklist for board compliance and regular consideration. One example, drawn from Federal 
Reserve practice, is the recent supervisory guidance requiring that every notice of a “Matter Requiring Attention” 
(MRA) issued by supervisors must be reviewed, and compliance signed off, by the board of directors. There are 
some MRAs that clearly should come to the board’s attention, but the failure to discriminate among them is almost 
surely distracting from strategic and risk-related analyses and oversight by boards.”)

level of granularity that is more appropriate for management to remediate, with board oversight.  

The new proposed framework is designed to make boards more effective in holding management 

accountable in these efforts.  While we have proposed that most MRAs and MRIAs be addressed 

in the first instance to management and not to the board, the board would continue to receive 

MRAs where board practices are at issue or where management has failed to promptly and 

adequately take the required actions.  The board would also continue to receive copies of 

examination and inspection reports, including formal communications with the institution.  In the 

parlance of the proposed guidance I just outlined, we fully expect the board to actively manage 

the information flow related to MRAs and to hold management accountable for remediating 

them.  In doing so, a board may choose to track progress and closure of MRAs through an 

appropriate board committee, rather than getting into the granular detail on every individual 

MRA.   

Conclusion 

 We need financial institutions that are strong enough to support economic growth by 

lending through the economic cycle.  To achieve that goal, we need strong and effective boards 

of directors at firms of all sizes.  A strong and effective board provides strategic leadership and 

oversight, which is much more challenging and important than checking off lists of assigned 

tasks.  I look forward to our continuing dialogue on this subject today and in the months to come, 

and reviewing carefully the comments received on the proposal.
