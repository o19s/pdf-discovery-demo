Panel Discussion at the European Central Bank: 
Emerging from the Crisis:  Where Do We Stand? 


Remarks by

Chairman 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the  
 

Sixth European Central Bank Central Banking Conference 
 

Frankfurt, Germany 
 
 
 

November 19, 2010


 
 The last time I was here at the European Central Bank (ECB), almost exactly two 

years ago, I sat on a distinguished panel much like this one to help mark the 10th 

anniversary of the euro.  Even as we celebrated the remarkable achievements of the 

founders of the common currency, however, the global economy stood near the precipice.  

Financial markets were volatile and illiquid, and the viability of some of the world’s 

leading financial institutions had been called into question.  With asset prices falling and 

the flow of credit to the nonfinancial sector constricted, most of the world’s economies 

had entered what would prove to be a sharp and protracted economic downturn.   

 By the time of that meeting, the world’s central banks had already taken 

significant steps to stabilize financial markets and to mitigate the worst effects of the 

recession, and they would go on to do much more.  Very broadly, the responses of central 

banks to the crisis fell into two classes.  First, central banks undertook a range of 

initiatives to restore normal functioning to financial markets and to strengthen the 

banking system.  They expanded existing lending facilities and created new facilities to 

provide liquidity to the financial sector.  Key examples include the ECB’s one-year long-

term refinancing operations, the Federal Reserve’s auctions of discount window credit 

(via the Term Auction Facility), and the Bank of Japan’s more recent extension of its 

liquidity supply operations.  To help satisfy banks’ funding needs in multiple currencies, 

central banks established liquidity swap lines that allowed them to draw each other’s 

currencies and lend those funds to financial institutions in their jurisdictions; the Federal 

Reserve ultimately established swap lines with 14 other central banks.  Central banks also 

worked to stabilize financial markets that were important conduits of credit to the 

nonfinancial sector.  For example, the Federal Reserve launched facilities to help stabilize

the commercial paper market and the market for asset-backed securities, through which 

flow much of the funding for student, auto, credit card, and small business loans as well 

as for commercial mortgages.  In addition, the Federal Reserve, the ECB, the Bank of 

England, the Swiss National Bank, and other central banks played important roles in 

stabilizing and strengthening their respective banking systems.  In particular, central 

banks helped develop and oversee stress tests that assessed banks’ vulnerabilities and 

capital needs.  These tests proved instrumental in reducing investors’ uncertainty about 

banks’ assets and prospective losses, bolstering confidence in the banking system, and 

facilitating banks’ raising of private capital.  Central banks are also playing an important 

ongoing role in the development of new international capital and liquidity standards for 

the banking system that will help protect against future crises. 

Second, beyond necessary measures to stabilize financial markets and banking 

systems, central banks moved proactively to ease monetary policy to help support their 

economies.  Initially, monetary policy was eased through the conventional means of cuts 

in short-term policy rates, including a coordinated rate cut in October 2008 by the Federal 

Reserve, the ECB, and other leading central banks.  However, as policy rates approached 

the zero lower bound, central banks eased policy by additional means.  For example, 

some central banks, including the Federal Reserve, sought to reduce longer-term interest 

rates by communicating that policy rates were likely to remain low for some time.  A 

prominent example of the use of central bank communication to further ease policy was 

the Bank of Canada’s conditional commitment to keep rates near zero until the end of the

second quarter of 2010.1  To provide additional monetary accommodation, several central 

banks--among them the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the ECB, and the Bank of 

Japan--purchased significant quantities of financial assets, including government debt, 

mortgage-backed securities, or covered bonds, depending on the central bank.  Asset 

purchases seem to have been effective in easing financial conditions; for example, the 

evidence suggests that such purchases significantly lowered longer-term interest rates in 

both the United States and the United Kingdom.2

   Although the efforts of central banks to stabilize the financial system and provide 

monetary accommodation helped set the stage for recovery, economic growth rates in the 

advanced economies have been relatively weak.  Of course, the economic outlook varies 

importantly by country and region, and the policy responses to these developments 

among central banks have differed accordingly.  In the United States, we have seen a 

slowing of the pace of expansion since earlier this year.  The unemployment rate has 

remained close to 10 percent since mid-2009, with a substantial fraction of the 

unemployed out of work for six months or longer.  Moreover, inflation has been 

declining and is currently quite low, with measures of underlying inflation running close 

to 1 percent.  Although we project that economic growth will pick up and unemployment 

decline somewhat in the coming year, progress thus far has been disappointingly slow.   


 In this environment, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) judged that 

additional monetary policy accommodation was needed to support the economic recovery 

and help ensure that inflation, over time, is at desired levels.  Accordingly, the FOMC 

                                                           
1 Recent work at the Bank of Canada (see He, 2010) suggests that the bank’s forward guidance may have 
pushed back expectations of when policy accommodation would be withdrawn.  For a differing view, see 
Chehal and Trehan (2009).

announced earlier this month its intention to purchase an additional $600 billion of 

longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011, a pace of about 

$75 billion per month.  The Committee also will maintain its current policy of reinvesting 

principal payments from its securities holdings in longer-term Treasury securities.  

Financial conditions eased notably in anticipation of the Committee’s announcement, 

suggesting that this policy will be effective in promoting recovery. As has been the case 

with more conventional monetary policy in the past, this policy action will be regularly 

reviewed in light of the evolving economic outlook and the Committee’s assessment of 

the effects of its policies on the economy.   

 I draw several lessons from our collective experience in dealing with the crisis.  

(My list is by no means exhaustive.)  The first lesson is that, in a world in which the 

consequences of financial crises can be devastating, fostering financial stability is a 

critical part of overall macroeconomic management.  Accordingly, central banks and 

other financial regulators must be vigilant in monitoring financial markets and 

institutions for threats to systemic stability and diligent in taking steps to address such 

threats.  Supervision of individual financial institutions, macroprudential monitoring, and 

monetary policy are mutually reinforcing undertakings, with active involvement in one 

sphere providing crucial information and expertise for the others.  Indeed, at the Federal 

Reserve, we have restructured our financial supervisory functions so that staff members 

with expertise in a range of areas--including economics, financial markets, and 

supervision--work closely together in evaluating potential risks. 

  Second, the past two years have demonstrated the value of policy flexibility and 

openness to new approaches.  During the crisis, central banks were creative and 


- 5 - 
 


innovative, developing programs that played a significant role in easing financial stress 

and supporting economic activity.  As the global financial system and national economies 

become increasingly complex and interdependent, novel policy challenges will continue 

to require innovative policy responses. 

 Third, as was the focus of my remarks two years ago, in addressing financial 

crises, international cooperation can be very helpful; indeed, given the global integration 

of financial markets, such cooperation is essential.  Central bankers worked closely 

together throughout the crisis and continue to do so.  Our frequent contact, whether in 

bilateral discussions or in international meetings, permits us to share our thinking, 

compare analyses, and stay informed of developments around the world.  It also enables 

us to move quickly when shared problems call for swift joint responses, such as the 

coordinated rate cuts and the creation of liquidity swap lines during the crisis.  These 

actions and others we’ve taken over the past few years underscore our resolve to work 

together to address our common economic challenges.
