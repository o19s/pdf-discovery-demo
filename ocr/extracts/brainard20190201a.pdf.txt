“Research Symposium on the Community Reinvestment Act” 
Hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 

 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 


February 1, 2019 



Thank you all for participating in our Research Symposium on the Community 

Reinvestment Act (CRA).  I am happy to have an opportunity to learn from your extensive 

experience and expertise.1    

At the Federal Reserve, we value the CRA as a critical tool for providing support to low- 

and moderate income (LMI) families and their communities.  And we are interested in 

strengthening the CRA as it encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities 

they are chartered to serve.  Today’s research forum is one part of an extensive outreach effort 

we are undertaking to gather the best ideas for improving implementation of the Community 

Reinvestment Act.   

Over the past four months alone, all 12 of our Reserve Banks have hosted roundtables in 

locations around the country, from San Francisco to Boston, and from Rapid City to Puerto Rico.  

The purpose is to hear ideas on improving the CRA regulations from the bankers and community 

groups that have a stake in the CRA’s success.  In addition, we held two roundtables at the 

Federal Reserve Board earlier this week to gather perspectives from national organizations 

focused on policy topics, such as housing, small business lending, and consumer credit.2   

We have also consulted with our advisory councils to gather their thoughts on CRA 

reform.  We have asked our large and community bank advisory councils, the Federal Advisory 

Council and the Community Depository Institutions Advisory Council, about their experiences 

with the CRA and suggestions for improvements.  We have also sought community perspectives.

At our most recent meeting with our Community Advisory Council, we asked for their 

recommendations for reform.3 

Even though we decided not to join the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in the 

publication of its August 2018 Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking concerning revisions to 

the CRA regulations, we have been reviewing the approximately 1,500 comment letters 

submitted by academics, banks and banking trade associations, community and consumer 

groups, and citizens. 

So what have we learned so far from the comment letters we have reviewed and the 

roundtables we have held?  If there is one common thread, it is that support for the Community 

Reinvestment Act is broad and deep.  Commenters across the board applauded the significant 

volume of CRA loans and investments that have supported LMI households and communities, as 

well as the benefits households and communities have realized from the CRA’s focus on local 

retail financial services, small business lending, and community development lending, 

investments, and services.  And they asked that the three banking agencies work together toward 

a joint rulemaking proposal so that CRA policies can be clearly and consistently applied across 

agencies.   

Second, there are some good ideas about how to modernize the procedures for setting the 

area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA activities while retaining the core focus on 

place.  This is not a simple challenge, and this morning’s panel identified some promising 

solutions to the challenge of modernizing the definition of assessment areas to keep up with 

changes in banks’ business models.  I appreciated the panelists’ insights on how to balance the

importance of place with various business models, including to reflect the extensive use of 

digital channels and other changes in the banking industry.  The public comments we have read 

so far suggest general agreement that there is a need for an update--but not a complete overhaul--

of assessment areas through a balanced package of reforms.  We have heard general support for 

assessment areas that reflect each bank’s business model, recognizing that branch-based 

assessment areas work for many banks but that additional or different assessment areas may be 

appropriate for others.   

Third, we have received helpful input on tailoring CRA regulations to banks of different 

sizes and business models.  Many of the comments we reviewed expressed support for retaining 

different performance tests for different types of banks, including the strategic plan option.  We 

also heard this at the regional roundtables, where banker participants ranged from small 

community banks to large internet-only banks.  It was clear that CRA regulations cannot be one-

size-fits-all. 

Fourth, we have heard some good suggestions for ensuring that any modernization of 

assessment areas should keep in focus the goal of encouraging banks to seek out opportunities in 

underserved areas, including in this morning’s panel on assessment areas.  The concern about 

CRA hotspots and credit deserts was echoed in the comment letters, and several commenters 

offered helpful suggestions for addressing this problem going forward.  And the need to create 

incentives for CRA capital to reach underserved communities was a theme we heard in our 

regional roundtables from both bankers and community groups.  

Fifth, we have received many suggestions about how to increase the consistency and 

predictability of CRA evaluations and ratings.  Although we are still in the process of working 

through the public’s comments, those we have read so far suggest general support for the view

that the CRA regulations and examinations would benefit from more clarity, consistency, and 

predictability.  Likewise, there is an openness to expanding the use of metrics that evaluate 

components of a bank’s activity on an assessment area level, while recognizing the importance 

of also leveraging performance context information, including of a qualitative nature, so that 

bankers and examiners are able to identify and understand local community needs.  The first 

panel this morning on metrics and evaluating performance also helped further our understanding 

in this area, with particular focus on the investment behaviors of CRA-motivated banks and on 

how we might strengthen the CRA to better evaluate a bank’s performance in meeting the credit 

needs of its communities.   

Sixth, in both comment letters and roundtables, community and consumer groups 

emphasized the historical context of the CRA as it relates to redlining practices.  To that end, 

they strongly supported the CRA retaining a proactive focus on reaching all underserved 

borrowers, including low-income communities and communities of color.  The central thrust of 

the CRA is to encourage banks to ensure that all creditworthy borrowers have fair access to 

credit, and, to do so successfully, it has long been recognized that they must guard against 

discriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices. 

This has been an excellent convening so far, and I want to thank you for sharing your 

knowledge and insights with us.  The Federal Reserve is a research-driven institution, and we 

want to be sure that we are aware of all the latest research on the effectiveness of the CRA and 

what the research has to say about potential regulatory improvements.  Today’s conversation is 

an opportunity not only to hear from external academic researchers, but also to have a robust 

conversation with practitioners about how this research might inform the Board’s work.  This

afternoon, I look forward to hearing the conversation on the effectiveness of the CRA, past, 

present, and future. 

I have had opportunities to hear directly from stakeholders in a variety of settings, 

kicking off with a community development visit in Baltimore last April and most recently in 

Denver, at our first regional roundtable.4  The Denver roundtable was attended by state member 

banks and was hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.  I appreciated the robust 

conversation among knowledgeable individuals whose work touches on the CRA every day.  

Sitting around a table together provided an opportunity for me to hear community bankers reflect 

on what has worked well for their communities and what they see as challenges, and to provide 

thoughtful suggestions on what they think might work best going forward.  It was also helpful to 

be exposed to some differences of views.  The best approach to implementing the CRA in 

today’s environment is a complex issue, so I value hearing a wide range of suggestions.   

In closing, I want to reiterate my own commitment to strengthening the CRA, which is 

widely shared across the Federal Reserve System.  We aim to promote more CRA activity, not 

less.  We think that simplifying and clarifying the regulations while strengthening local 

community engagement will help us accomplish that goal.  Thank you for your help in this 

process.
