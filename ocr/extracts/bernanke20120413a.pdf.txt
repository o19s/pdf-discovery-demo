Some Reflections on the Crisis and the Policy Response 




Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the  


Conference on “Rethinking Finance:  Perspectives on the Crisis” 

Presented by the Russell Sage Foundation and The Century Foundation 


New York, New York 








April 13, 2012 






I would like to thank the conference organizers for the opportunity to offer a few 

remarks on the causes of the 2007-09 financial crisis as well as on the Federal Reserve’s 

policy response.  The topic is a large one, and today I will be able only to lay out some 

basic themes.  In doing so, I will draw from talks and testimonies that I gave during the 

crisis and its aftermath, particularly my testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry 

Commission in September 2010.

  Given the time available, I will focus narrowly on the 

financial crisis and the Federal Reserve’s response in its capacity as liquidity provider of 

last resort, leaving discussions of monetary policy and the aftermath of the crisis to 

another occasion. 

Triggers and Vulnerabilities 

 In its analysis of the crisis, my testimony before the Financial Crisis Inquiry 

Commission drew the distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities.  The triggers of 

the crisis were the particular events or factors that touched off the events of 2007-09--the 

proximate causes, if you will.  Developments in the market for subprime mortgages were 

a prominent example of a trigger of the crisis.  In contrast, the vulnerabilities were the 

structural, and more fundamental, weaknesses in the financial system and in regulation 

and supervision that served to propagate and amplify the initial shocks.  In the private 

sector, some key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage; excessive dependence 

on unstable short-term funding; deficiencies in risk management in major financial firms; 

and the use of exotic and nontransparent financial instruments that obscured 

concentrations of risk.  In the public sector, my list of vulnerabilities would include gaps 

in the regulatory structure that allowed systemically important firms and markets to

escape comprehensive supervision; failures of supervisors to effectively apply some 

existing authorities; and insufficient attention to threats to the stability of the system as a 

whole (that is, the lack of a macroprudential focus in regulation and supervision). 

 The distinction between triggers and vulnerabilities is helpful in that it allows us 

to better understand why the factors that are often cited as touching off the crisis seem 

disproportionate to the magnitude of the financial and economic reaction.  Consider 

subprime mortgages, on which many popular accounts of the crisis focus.  

Contemporaneous data indicated that the total quantity of subprime mortgages 

outstanding in 2007 was well less than $1 trillion; some more-recent accounts place the 

figure somewhat higher.  In absolute terms, of course, the potential for losses on these 

loans was large--on the order of hundreds of billions of dollars.  However, judged in 

relation to the size of global financial markets, aggregate exposures to subprime 

mortgages were quite modest.  By way of comparison, it is not especially uncommon for 

one day’s paper losses in global stock markets to exceed the losses on subprime 

mortgages suffered during the entire crisis, without obvious ill effect on market 

functioning or on the economy.  Thus, losses on subprime mortgages can plausibly 

account for the massive reaction seen during the crisis only insofar as they interacted with 

other factors--more fundamental vulnerabilities--that served to amplify their effects.    

 On the surface, the puzzle of disproportionate cause and effect seems somewhat 

less stark if one takes the boom and bust in the U.S. housing market as the trigger of the 

crisis, as the paper gains and losses associated with the swing in house prices were many 

times the losses associated directly with subprime loans.  Indeed, the 30 percent or so 

aggregate decline in house prices since their peak has by now eliminated nearly $7 


 - 3 - 

trillion in paper wealth.  However, on closer examination, it is not clear that even the 

large movements in house prices, in the absence of the underlying weaknesses in our 

financial system, can account for the magnitude of the crisis.  First, much of the decline 

in house prices has occurred since the most intense phase of the crisis; the decline in 

prices since September 2008 is probably better viewed as largely the result of, rather than 

a cause of, the crisis and ensuing recession.  More fundamentally, however, any theory of 

the crisis that ties its magnitude to the size of the housing bust must also explain why the 

fall of dot-com stock prices just a few years earlier, which destroyed as much or more 

paper wealth--more than $8 trillion--resulted in a relatively short and mild recession and 

no major financial instability.
2
  Once again, the explanation of the differences between 

the two episodes must be that the problems in housing and mortgage markets interacted 

with deeper vulnerabilities in the financial system in ways that the dot-com bust did not.   

So let me turn, then, to a discussion of those vulnerabilities and how they amplified the 

effects of triggers like the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.   

A number of the vulnerabilities I listed a few moments ago were associated with 

the increased importance of the so-called shadow banking system.  Shadow banking, as 

usually defined, comprises a diverse set of institutions and markets that, collectively, 

carry out traditional banking functions--but do so outside, or in ways only loosely linked 

to, the traditional system of regulated depository institutions.  Examples of important

 According to the Federal Reserve’s statistical release “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States,” the 

value of real estate held by households fell from $22.7 trillion in the first quarter of 2006 to $20.9 trillion in 

the fourth quarter of 2007 (down 8.1 percent from the first quarter of 2006).  It then declined to 

$18.5 trillion in the third quarter of 2008 (down 18.6 percent from the first quarter of 2006) and to 

$16.0 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2011 (down 29.7 percent from the first quarter of 2006).  The stock 

market wealth of U.S. households peaked at $18.1 trillion in the first quarter of 2000 and fell $6.2 trillion to 

$11.9 trillion through the third quarter of 2001.  After a short-lived recovery, stock market wealth bottomed 

at $9.9 trillion in the third quarter of 2002.  Overall, stock market wealth fell $8.3 trillion (or 46 percent) 

between its peak in the first quarter of 2000 and its trough in the third quarter of 2002.  The flow of funds 

accounts are published quarterly and are available at www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1.

components of the shadow banking system include securitization vehicles, asset-backed 

commercial paper (ABCP) conduits, money market mutual funds, markets for repurchase 

agreements (repos), investment banks, and mortgage companies.  Before the crisis, the 

shadow banking system had come to play a major role in global finance. 

Economically speaking, as I noted, shadow banking bears strong functional 

similarities to the traditional banking sector.  Like traditional banking, the shadow 

banking sector facilitates maturity transformation (that is, it is used to fund longer-term, 

less-liquid assets with short-term, more-liquid liabilities), and it channels savings into 

specific investments, mostly debt-like instruments.  In part, the rapid growth of shadow 

banking reflected various types of regulatory arbitrage--for example, the minimization of 

capital requirements.  However, instruments that fund the shadow banking system, such 

as money market mutual funds and repos, also met a rapidly growing demand among 

investors, generally large institutions and corporations, seeking cash-like assets for use in 

managing their liquidity.  Commercial banks were limited in their ability to meet this 

growing demand by prohibitions on the payment of interest on business checking 

accounts and by relatively low limits on the size of deposit accounts that can be insured 

by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). 

As became apparent during the crisis, a key vulnerability of the system was the 

heavy reliance of the shadow banking sector, as well as some of the largest global banks, 

on various forms of short-term wholesale funding, including commercial paper, repos, 

securities lending transactions, and interbank loans.  The ease, flexibility, and low 

perceived cost of short-term funding also supported a broader trend toward higher 


 - 5 - 

leverage and greater maturity mismatch in individual shadow banking institutions and in 

the sector as a whole. 

While banks also rely on short-term funding and leverage, they benefit from a 

government-provided safety net, including deposit insurance and backstop liquidity 

provision by the central bank.  Shadow banking activities do not have these safeguards, 

so they employ alternative mechanisms to gain investor confidence.  Among these 

mechanisms are the collateralization of many shadow banking liabilities; regulatory or 

contractual restrictions placed on portfolio holdings, such as the liquidity and credit 

quality requirements applicable to money market mutual funds; and the imprimaturs of 

credit rating agencies.  Indeed, the very foundation of shadow banking and its rapid 

growth before the crisis was the widely held view (among both investors and regulators) 

that these safeguards would protect shadow banking activities against runs and panics, 

similar to the protection given to commercial banking by the government safety net.  

Unfortunately, this view turned out to be wrong.  When it became clear to investors that 

these alternative protections might not be adequate to protect against losses, widespread 

flight from the shadow banking system occurred, with pernicious dynamics reminiscent 

of the banking panics of an earlier era.  

 Although the vulnerabilities associated with short-term wholesale funding and 

excessive leverage can be seen as structural weaknesses of the global financial system, 

they can also be viewed as a consequence of poor risk management by financial 

institutions and investors, which I would count as another major vulnerability of the 

system before the crisis.  Unfortunately, the crisis revealed a number of significant 

defects in private-sector risk management and risk controls, importantly including 


 - 6 - 

insufficient capacity by many large firms to track firmwide risk exposures, such as off-

balance-sheet exposures.   

This lack of capacity by major financial institutions to track firmwide risk 

exposures led in turn to inadequate risk diversification, so that losses--rather than being 

dispersed broadly--proved in some cases to be heavily concentrated among relatively 

few, highly leveraged companies.  Here, I think, is the principal explanation of why the 

busts in dot-com stock prices and in the housing and mortgage markets had such 

markedly different effects.  In the case of dot-com stocks, losses were spread relatively 

widely across many types of investors.  In contrast, following the housing and mortgage 

bust, losses were felt disproportionately at key nodes of the financial system, notably 

highly leveraged banks, broker-dealers, and securitization vehicles.  Some of these 

entities were forced to engage in rapid asset sales at fire-sale prices, which undermined 

confidence in counterparties exposed to these assets, led to sharp withdrawals of funding, 

and disrupted financial intermediation, with severe consequences for the economy. 

Private-sector risk management also failed to keep up with financial innovation in 

many cases.  An important example is the extension of the traditional originate-to-

distribute business model to encompass increasingly complex securitized credit products, 

with wholesale market funding playing a key role.  In general, the originate-to-distribute 

model breaks down the process of credit extension into components or stages--from 

origination to financing and to the postfinancing monitoring of the borrower’s ability to 

repay--in a manner reminiscent of how manufacturers distribute the stages of production 

across firms and locations.  This general approach has been used in various forms for 

many years and can produce significant benefits, including lower credit costs and 


 - 7 - 

increased access of consumers and small and medium-sized businesses to capital markets.  

However, the expanded use of this model to finance subprime mortgages through 

securitization was mismanaged at several points, including the initial underwriting, which 

deteriorated markedly, in part because of incentive schemes that effectively rewarded 

originators for the quantity rather than the quality of the mortgages extended.  Loans 

were then packaged into securities that proved complex, opaque, and unwieldy; for 

example, when defaults became widespread, the legal agreements underlying the 

securitizations made reasonable modifications of troubled mortgages difficult.  Rating 

agencies’ ratings of asset-backed securities were revealed to be subject to conflicts of 

interest and faulty models.  At the end of the chain were investors who often relied 

mainly on ratings and did not make distinctions among AAA-rated securities.  Even if the 

ultimate investors wanted to do their own credit analysis, the information needed to do so 

was often difficult or impossible to obtain. 

 Dependence on short-term funding, high leverage, and inadequate risk 

management were critical vulnerabilities of the private sector prior to the crisis.  

Derivative transactions further increased risk concentrations and the vulnerability of the 

system, notably by shifting the location and apparent nature of exposures in ways that 

were not transparent to many market participants.  But even as private-sector activities 

increased systemic risk, the public sector also failed to appreciate or sufficiently respond 

to the building vulnerabilities in the financial system--both because the statutory 

framework of financial regulation was not well suited to addressing some key 

vulnerabilities and because some of the authorities that did exist were not used 

effectively. 


 - 8 - 

In retrospect, it is clear that the statutory framework of financial regulation in 

place before the crisis contained serious gaps.  Critically, shadow banking activities were, 

for the most part, not subject to consistent and effective regulatory oversight.  Much 

shadow banking lacked meaningful prudential regulation, including various special 

purpose vehicles, ABCP conduits, and many nonbank mortgage-origination companies.  

No regulatory body restricted the leverage and liquidity policies of these entities, and few 

if any regulatory standards were imposed on the quality of their risk management or the 

prudence of their risk-taking.  Market discipline, imposed by creditors and counterparties, 

helped on some dimensions but did not effectively limit the systemic risks these entities 

posed. 

Other shadow banking activities were potentially subject to some prudential 

oversight, but weaknesses in the statutory and regulatory framework meant that in 

practice they were inadequately regulated and supervised.  For example, the Securities 

and Exchange Commission supervised the largest broker-dealer holding companies but 

only through an opt-in arrangement that lacked the force of a statutory regulatory regime.  

Large broker-dealer holding companies faced serious losses and funding problems during 

the crisis, and the instability of such firms as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers severely 

damaged the financial system.  Similarly, the insurance operations of American 

International Group, Inc. (AIG), were supervised and regulated by various state and 

international insurance regulators, and the Office of Thrift Supervision had authority to 

supervise AIG as a thrift holding company.  However, oversight of AIG Financial 

Products, which housed the derivatives activities that imposed major losses on the firm, 

was extremely limited in practice.  


 - 9 - 

The gaps in statutory authority had the additional effect of limiting the 

information available to regulators and, consequently, may have made it more difficult to 

recognize the underlying vulnerabilities and complex linkages in the overall financial 

system.  Shadow banking institutions that were unregulated or lightly regulated were 

typically not required to report data that would have adequately revealed their risk 

positions or practices.  Moreover, the lack of preexisting reporting and supervisory 

relationships hindered systematic gathering of information that might have helped 

policymakers in the early days of the crisis. 

A broader failing was that regulatory agencies and supervisory practices were 

focused on the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions or markets--what 

we now refer to as microprudential supervision.  In the United States and most other 

advanced economies, no governmental entity had either a mandate or sufficient 

authority--now often called macroprudential authority--to take actions to limit systemic 

risks that could result from the collective behavior of financial institutions and markets.  

Gaps in the statutory framework were an important reason for the buildup of risk 

in certain parts of the system and for the inadequate response of the public sector to that 

buildup.  But even when the relevant statutory authorities did exist, they were not always 

used forcefully or effectively enough by regulators and supervisors, including the Federal 

Reserve.  Notably, bank regulators did not do enough to force large financial institutions 

to strengthen their internal risk-management systems or to curtail risky practices.  The 

Federal Reserve’s Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, undertaken in the spring of 

2009 and popularly known as the “stress tests,” played a critical role in restoring 

confidence in the U.S. banking system, but it also demonstrated that many institutions’ 


 - 10 - 

information systems could not provide timely, accurate information about bank exposures 

to counterparties or complete information about the aggregate risks posed by different 

positions and portfolios.  Regulators had recognized these problems in some cases but did 

not press firms vigorously enough to fix them.  

Even without a macroprudential mandate, regulators could also have done more to 

try to mitigate risks to the broader financial system.  In retrospect, stronger bank capital 

standards--notably those relating to the quality of capital and the amount of capital 

required for banks’ trading book assets--and more attention to the liquidity risks faced by 

the largest, most interconnected firms would have made the financial system as a whole 

more resilient. 

The Crisis as a Classic Financial Panic  

Having laid out some of the triggers and vulnerabilities that set the stage for the 

crisis, I can briefly sketch the evolution of the crisis itself.  As I have noted, 

developments in housing and mortgage markets played an important role as triggers.  

Beginning in 2007, declining house prices and rising rates of foreclosure raised serious 

concerns about the values of mortgage-related assets and considerable uncertainty about 

where those losses would fall.  The economy officially fell into recession in 

December 2007, following several months of financial stress.  However, the most severe 

economic consequences followed the extreme market movements in the fall of 2008.  

To a significant extent, the crisis is best understood as a classic financial panic--

differing in details but fundamentally similar to the panics described by Bagehot and 

many others.

  The most familiar type of panic that has occurred historically, involving

Charles Scribner’s Sons).  The classic theoretical analysis of “pure” banking panics is in Douglas W. 


 - 11 - 

runs on banks by retail depositors, had been made largely obsolete by deposit insurance, 

central bank backstop liquidity facilities, and the associated government supervision of 

banks.  But a panic is possible in any situation in which longer-term, illiquid assets are 

financed by short-term, liquid liabilities and in which providers of short-term funding 

either lose confidence in the borrower or become worried that other short-term lenders 

may lose confidence.  The combination of dependence on wholesale, short-term 

financing; excessive leverage; generally poor risk management; and the gaps and 

weaknesses in regulatory oversight created an environment in which a powerful, self-

reinforcing panic could begin.
4
 

Indeed, panic-like phenomena arose in multiple contexts and in multiple ways 

during the crisis.  The repo market, a major source of short-term credit for many financial 

institutions, notably including the independent investment banks, was an important 

example.  In repo agreements, loans are collateralized by financial assets, and the 

maximum amount of the loan is the current assessed value of the collateral less a safety 

margin, or haircut.  The secured nature of repo agreements gave firms and regulators 

confidence that runs were unlikely.  But this confidence was misplaced.  Once the crisis 

began, repo lenders became increasingly concerned about the possibility that they would 

be forced to receive collateral instead of cash, collateral that would then have to be 

disposed of in falling and illiquid markets.  In some contexts, lenders responded by 

                                                                                                                                                 
Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983), “Bank Runs, Deposit Insurance, and Liquidity,” Journal of 

Political Economy, vol. 91 (3), pp. 401-19).  Note that the term “panic” does not necessarily imply 

irrational behavior on the part of depositors or investors; it is perfectly rational to participate in a run if one 

fears that the bank will be forced to close.  However, the collective action of many depositors or investors 

can lead to outcomes that are undesirable from the point of view of the economy as a whole.

imposing increasingly higher haircuts, cutting the effective amount of funding available 

to borrowers.  In other contexts, lenders simply pulled away, as in a deposit run; in these 

cases, some borrowers lost access to repo entirely, and some securities became 

unfundable in the repo market.  In either case, absent sufficient funding, borrowers were 

frequently left with no option but to sell assets into illiquid markets.  These forced sales 

drove down asset prices, increased volatility, and weakened the financial positions of all 

holders of similar assets.  Volatile asset prices and weaker borrower balance sheets in 

turn heightened the risks borne by repo lenders, further boosting the incentives to demand 

higher haircuts or withdraw funding entirely.  This unstable dynamic was operating in 

full force around the time of the near failure of Bear Stearns in March 2008, and again 

during the worsening of the crisis in mid-September of that year.
5
 

Classic panic-type phenomena occurred in other contexts as well.  Early in the 

crisis, structured investment vehicles and many other asset-backed programs were unable 

to roll over their commercial paper as investors pulled back, and the programs were 

forced to draw on liquidity lines from banks or to sell assets.
6
  The resulting pressure on 

the bank liquidity providers, evident especially in the market for dollar-denominated 

loans in short-term funding markets, impeded the functioning of the financial system 

throughout the crisis.  Following the Lehman collapse and the “breaking of the buck” by

a money market mutual fund that held commercial paper issued by Lehman, both money 

market mutual funds and the commercial paper market were also subject to runs.
7
  More 

generally, during the crisis, runs of short-term uninsured creditors created severe funding 

problems for a number of financial firms, including several large broker-dealers and also 

some bank holding companies.  In some cases, withdrawals of funds by creditors were 

augmented by “runs” in other guises--for example, by prime brokerage customers of 

investment banks concerned about the safety of cash and securities held at those firms or 

by derivatives counterparties demanding additional margin.
8
  Overall, the emergence of 

run-like phenomena in a variety of contexts helps explain the remarkably sharp and 

sudden intensification of the financial crisis, its rapid global spread, and the fact that 

standard market indicators largely failed to forecast the abrupt deterioration in financial 

conditions.  

The multiple instances of run-like behavior during the crisis, together with the 

associated sharp increases in liquidity premiums and dysfunction in many markets, 

motivated much of the Federal Reserve’s policy response.
9
  Bagehot advised central 

banks--the only institutions that have the power to increase the aggregate liquidity in the 

system--to respond to panics by lending freely against sound collateral.  Following that 

advice, from the beginning of the crisis, the Fed, like other major central banks, provided

large amounts of short-term liquidity to financial institutions, including primary dealers 

as well as banks, on a broad range of collateral.
10

  Reflecting the contemporary 

institutional environment, it also provided backstop liquidity support for components of 

the shadow banking system, including money market mutual funds, the commercial paper 

market, and the asset-backed securities markets.  To be sure, the provision of liquidity 

alone can by no means solve the problems of credit risk and credit losses, but it can 

reduce liquidity premiums, help restore the confidence of investors, and thus promote 

stability.  It can also reduce panic-driven credit problems in cases in which such problems 

result from price declines during liquidity-driven fire sales of assets. 

The pricing of the liquidity facilities was an important part of the Federal 

Reserve’s strategy.  Rates could not be too high; to have a positive effect, and to 

minimize the stigma of borrowing, the facilities had to be attractive relative to rates 

available (or nominally available) in illiquid, dysfunctional markets.  At the same time, 

pricing had to be sufficiently unattractive that borrowers would voluntarily withdraw 

from these facilities as market conditions normalized.  This desired outcome in fact 

occurred:  By early 2010, emergency lending had been drastically reduced, along with the 

demand for such lending. 

The Federal Reserve’s responses to the failure or near failure of a number of 

systemically critical firms reflected the best of bad options, given the absence of a legal 

framework for winding down such firms in an orderly way in the midst of a crisis--a 

framework that we now have.  However, those actions were, again, consistent with the 

Bagehot approach of lending against collateral to illiquid but solvent firms.  The

acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase was facilitated by a Federal Reserve loan 

against a designated set of assets, and the provision of liquidity to AIG was collateralized 

by the assets of the largest insurance company in the United States.  In both cases the 

Federal Reserve determined that the loans were adequately secured, and in both cases the 

Federal Reserve has either been repaid with interest or holds assets whose assessed 

values comfortably cover remaining loans.  

To say that the crisis was purely a liquidity-based panic would be to overstate the 

case.  Certainly, an important part of the resolution of the crisis involved assuring 

markets and counterparties of the solvency of key financial institutions, and that 

assurance was provided in significant part by the injection of capital, including public 

capital, and the issuance of guarantees--measures not available to the Federal Reserve.  In 

these respects, the Treasury-managed Troubled Asset Relief Program and the FDIC’s 

Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program played critical roles.  As I have noted, the 

Federal Reserve did help restore confidence in the solvency of the banking system by 

leading the stress tests of the 19 largest U.S. bank holding companies in the spring of 

2009.  These stress tests, which were both rigorous and transparent, helped make it 

possible for the tested banks to raise $120 billion in private capital in the ensuing months. 

The response to the panic also involved an extraordinary amount of international 

consultation and coordination.  Following a key meeting of the Group of Seven finance 

ministers and central bank governors in Washington on October 10, 2008, the 

governments of other industrial countries took strong measures to stabilize key financial 

institutions and markets.  Central banks collaborated closely throughout the crisis; in 

particular, the Federal Reserve undertook swap agreements with 14 other central banks to 


 - 16 - 

help ensure adequate dollar liquidity in global markets and thus keep credit flowing to 

U.S. households and businesses. 

Conclusion 

 The financial crisis of 2007-09 was difficult to anticipate for two reasons:  First, 

financial panics, being to a significant extent self-fulfilling crises of confidence, are 

inherently difficult to foresee.  Second, although the crisis bore some resemblance at a 

conceptual level to the panics known to Bagehot, it occurred in a rather different 

institutional context and was propagated and amplified by a number of vulnerabilities that 

had developed outside the traditional banking sector.  Once identified, however, the panic 

could be addressed to a significant extent using classic tools, including backstop liquidity 

provision by central banks, both here and abroad. 

 To avoid or at least mitigate future panics, the vulnerabilities that underlay the 

recent crisis must be fully addressed.  As you know, this process is well under way at 

both the national and international levels.  I will have to leave to another time a 

discussion of the extensive changes in regulatory frameworks, as well as the changes in 

the Federal Reserve’s own organization and practices, that have been or are being put in 

place.  Instead, I will close by noting that the events of the past few years have forcibly 

reminded us of the damage that severe financial crises can cause.  Going forward, for the 

Federal Reserve as well as other central banks, the promotion of financial stability must 

be on an equal footing with the management of monetary policy as the most critical 

policy priorities.
