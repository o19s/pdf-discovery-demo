Good morning, and welcome to day two of the Federal Reserve System 

Conference on Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and Communication Practices.1  I think 

you will have to agree that the presentations and discussion yesterday were uniformly 

thoughtful, substantive, and stimulating, and today we will have another impressive 

lineup of speakers and panelists addressing timely topics that are relevant to our review.  

And let me convey on behalf of Chair Powell, the Board of Governors, and the Reserve 

Bank Presidents, a sincere and deep appreciation to all the participants on this program, 

especially the authors of the seven outstanding papers, for the time, thought, and energy 

that went into preparing their contributions. 

Yesterday Professors Eberly, Stock, and Wright provided us with a thorough and 

thoughtful evaluation of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communications since 2009.  They conclude that the policy tools that the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) relied on—“level policy” and “slope policy,” to use their 

terminology—helped restore the U.S. economy to health and bring it close to the 

statutory goals of maximum employment and price stability assigned to us by the 

Congress. 

As was noted several times yesterday, in recent years forecasters and 

policymakers have been surprised by the decline in the unemployment rate and the size of 

the sustained ongoing gains in payroll employment.  FOMC participants’ estimates of the 

longer-run normal rate of unemployment in the Summary of Economic Projections 

illustrate this point—they have drifted lower over time as labor market conditions have

Federal Open Market Committee participants.  I would like to thank Ellen Meade for assistance in 
preparing these remarks.

improved and inflation has remained quiescent.2  The paper by Professors Abraham and 

Haltiwanger provided us with an innovative search-and-matching model to estimate labor 

market slack—which complements the standard estimates based on unemployment gaps 

and Phillips curve relationships.  On that same general topic, the panel discussion of 

national and community leaders moderated by Governor Brainard provided a valuable 

perspective on the labor market that could not otherwise be gleaned from the aggregate 

statistics we often consult. 

Of course, notwithstanding what is taught in many U.S. macroeconomics courses, 

the United States is not a closed economy but is one of many nations engaged in global 

finance and economic commerce.  Professor Obstfeld’s paper examined the ways that 

global economic integration affects inflation and the neutral rate of interest—or r*—and 

the role played by the U.S. dollar in transmitting the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy 

to other countries. 

In our final session yesterday, Professors Cecchetti and Schoenholtz assessed the 

Federal Reserve’s communication practices.  Based on interviews and conversations with 

market participants, academics, and former policymakers, Professors Cecchetti and 

Schoenholtz offered concrete suggestions for improving our most important 

communications vehicles. 

Our program today will feature papers by Lars Svensson on alternative monetary 

policy strategies, by Eric Sims and Cynthia Wu on the policy toolkit, and by Anil 

Kashyap and Caspar Siegert on the interplay between financial stability considerations 

                                                 
2 In January 2009, when longer-run projections were added to the Summary of Economic Projections, the 
midpoint of the central tendency for the longer-run normal unemployment rate was 4.9 percent.  In March 
2019, the median of the longer-run normal unemployment rate was 4.3 percent.

and monetary policy.  Our featured panel of national and community leaders moderated 

by President Rosengren will I’m sure offer valuable perspectives about how the monetary 

levers we pull and push affect communities, credit availability, and small businesses. 

Aside from being an intellectually stimulating two days, how does this week’s 

conference fit into the FOMC’s review of its monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communications?  Let me describe briefly how the review is structured.  Over the past 

several months, the individual Reserve Banks have been hosting a series of Fed Listens 

events—seven so far including this conference—with at least five more to follow in 

coming months.  Each event is organized with a format and list of participants that works 

best for that District but with two common elements:  that Fed officials do most of the 

listening and that, when feasible, the events be live streamed.  In Dallas, we heard from 

local leaders about the challenges facing lower-income communities.  In Minneapolis, we 

listened to researchers discuss the distributional consequences of the economic cycle and 

of monetary policy.  In Boston, we heard from small businesses, labor leaders, and 

groups that work in underserved communities about the effects of the Fed’s policymaking 

on New England residents.  In Camden, New Jersey, we learned about the workforce 

training initiatives of a local manufacturing firm.  In Richmond, a panel of local business 

and community leaders discussed the ways the Fed’s monetary policy affects the regional 

economy.  In New York, panelists representing labor, local government, and community 

organizations offered their perspectives on the relative importance of the Fed’s dual 

mandate goals.  As I and my Fed colleagues who have participated in these events will 

attest, they have provided us with valuable perspectives on the economy that we would 

not otherwise be able to glean from aggregate economic statistics.

In coming regularly scheduled meetings, the FOMC will undertake its assessment 

of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and communication practices.  This assessment 

will be informed by what we’ve heard at this conference, by our listening sessions in the 

Federal Reserve Districts, and by the work of System staff.  When the Committee tackles 

important issues, we take the time for wide-ranging and candid discussions, and so I 

expect our deliberations will continue over several meetings for the remainder of this 

year.  We will share our findings with the public when we have completed our review, 

likely during the first half of next year. 

Thank you and let’s move directly to our first session.
