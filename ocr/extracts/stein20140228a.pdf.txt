I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the paper “Market Tantrums and 

Monetary Policy.”  It is timely, provocative, and extremely insightful.  Let me start by 

summarizing what I take to be the paper’s main messages.
1
  First, the authors argue that 

policymakers should pay careful attention not just to measures of leverage in the banking 

and shadow banking sectors, but also to the financial stability risks that might arise from 

the behavior of unlevered asset managers, such as those running various types of bond 

funds.  Notably, assets under management in fixed-income funds have grown 

dramatically in the years since the onset of the financial crisis, even while various 

measures of financial-sector leverage have either continued to decline or remained 

subdued. 

Second, the authors develop a model of agency problems in delegated asset 

management, according to which an environment of low short-term rates can encourage 

asset managers concerned with their relative performance rankings to “reach for yield,” 

which in turn acts to compress risk premiums.  Moreover, the model has the feature that 

this reach for yield can end badly, with a sudden and sharp correction in risk premiums 

that arises endogenously in response to a small tightening of monetary policy.  The 

events of the spring and summer of 2013, when there was a rapid rise in bond market 

term premiums, are cited as a leading example of what the model sets out to capture. 

Third, the authors assert that the conventional regulatory toolkit, which is largely 

designed to contain intermediary leverage, is not well suited to dealing with the asset-

management sector.  Given this limitation of regulation, and because monetary policy has 

a direct influence on the behavior of asset managers, the financial stability risks that these

managers create should be factored into the design and conduct of monetary policy.  

Presumably, this consideration would imply that monetary policy should be somewhat 

less easy in a weak economy, all else being equal, to reduce the probability of an 

undesirable upward spike in rates and credit spreads down the road.  The authors are 

careful to note that “our analysis neither invalidates nor validates the course the Federal 

Reserve has actually taken.”
2
  Rather, they are highlighting a set of considerations that 

they believe should ultimately be incorporated into the design of a monetary policy 

framework.  This is the spirit in which I will discuss the paper--not as a comment on the 

current stance of policy, but as an exploration of the factors that should be taken into 

account when thinking about the tradeoffs associated with monetary policy more 

generally.   

The model in the paper is a simple one, and it does a nice job of framing the 

issues.  In particular, here is how I think about the value-added of the theory:  On the one 

hand, an emerging body of empirical work documents that an easing of monetary policy--

even via conventional policy tools in normal times--tends to reduce both the term 

premiums on long-term Treasury bonds and the credit spreads on corporate bonds.
3
  That 

is, monetary policy tends to work in part through its effect on capital market risk 

premiums, perhaps through some sort of risk-taking or reaching-for-yield mechanism.   

On the other hand, while this empirical observation sheds some interesting light 

on how monetary policy influences the real economy, it does not by itself suggest that 

there is any financial stability dark side to the lowered risk premiums that go with

monetary accommodation.  For there to be any meaningful tradeoff, there would have to 

be some sort of asymmetry in the unwinding of these risk premiums, whereby the 

eventual reversal either happens more abruptly, or causes larger economic effects, than 

the initial compression.  Said a little differently, if an easing of Federal Reserve policy 

puts downward pressure on term premiums and credit spreads, and if this downward 

pressure is only gradually reversed as policy begins to tighten, then what is the problem?   

The nice feature of the model is that it speaks to this asymmetry.  That is, it 

features a gradual compression of risk spreads during a period of monetary ease, and 

then, when policy begins to tighten, it delivers a sharp and abrupt correction, driven by a 

particular form of market dynamics.   

Of course, this is just a theoretical prediction.  One thing that the paper does not 

do, but which would be very helpful in assessing the real-world relevance of the model, 

would be to see if this sort of asymmetry in bond returns is present in the data.  In 

particular, if I am interpreting the model correctly, it implies a specific form of 

conditional volatility and skewness in bond returns.  For example, when term premiums 

are unusually low relative to historical norms, the model suggests an elevated probability 

of a sharp upward spike in rates.  I don’t know of any evidence that bears on this 

hypothesis in the bond market, though an analogous pattern does appear in stock market 

returns.

 See Chen, Hong, and Stein (2001).  They document that, consistent with a “bubble popping” view, stock 

returns are more negatively skewed when past returns have been positive and when valuation ratios (for 

example, market-to-book ratios) are high.  Alternatively, the ratio of downside to upside volatility is 

unusually high in such circumstances.

It is worth saying a little about the “musical chairs” mechanism that leads to the 

sharp spike in rates.  The fund managers in the model care about their relative 

performance in that they are averse to posting lower returns than their peers, holding 

fixed absolute performance.  These relative-performance concerns induce a form of 

strategic complementarity of fund manager actions.  Specifically, as short-term rates 

begin to rise and fund manager i contemplates whether she should bail out of long-term 

bonds and move into short-term bills, she is more apt to do so if she thinks that some 

other manager, j, is also going to bail--because she is worried that otherwise, she may 

wind up underperforming manager j and finishing last in the relative-performance 

tournament. 

While appearing in a different guise here, this strategic-complementarity effect--

the idea that any one agent is in more of a rush to get out when he or she thinks that 

others may also want to get out--is essentially the same mechanism that drives bank runs 

in the classic work of Diamond and Dybvig, and that, in one manifestation or another, 

creates financial fragility in many other settings.
5
  However, one thing that is distinctive 

about the variant presented in the current paper is that there is a clear prediction of 

exactly what sets off the run for the exits on the part of money managers--namely, a small 

increase in short rates beyond a certain threshold level.
6
  

The model focuses on one particular source of run-like fragility that might 

emanate from the asset-management sector, but there are others.  One that the paper

 See Diamond and Dybvig (1983). 

6
 This feature is in contrast to many other models in the Diamond-Dybvig (1983) tradition, which have 

multiple equilibria and hence convey a sense of fragility, but have less to say about what underlying 

variable tips the scales toward a run-like equilibrium.  The more pinned-down nature of the model in this 

paper comes from an application of the global-games methodology described in Morris and Shin (2003).

briefly mentions, and that is worth a fuller treatment, has to do with the potential for 

outflows of assets under management (AUM) from open-end funds.  Note that the model 

is effectively one of a closed-end fund, since the manager is assumed to have a fixed 

amount of AUM; the fragility, in this case, comes entirely from the manager’s portfolio 

allocation decision and from the strategic interaction among fund managers.  But another 

source of run-like risk comes from the strategic interaction among fund investors and the 

incentives that each of them may have to get out before others do when asset values are at 

risk of declining.   

These AUM-driven run dynamics are more likely to arise in those open-end funds 

that hold relatively illiquid assets.  The key question in determining whether there is a 

strategic complementarity in the withdrawal decisions of fund investors is, When investor 

i exits on day t, does the net asset value (NAV) at the end of the day that defines investor 

i’s exit price fully reflect the ultimate price effect of the sales created by his exit?  If not, 

those investors who stay behind are hurt, which is what creates run incentives.  And, if 

the run incentives are strong enough, then a credit-oriented bond fund starts looking 

pretty bank-like.  The fact that its liabilities are not technically debt claims is not all that 

helpful in this case--they are still demandable, and hence investors can pull out very 

rapidly if the terms of exit create a penalty for being last out the door. 

A fund’s stated NAV is less likely to keep pace with the ultimate price impact of 

investor withdrawals if the underlying assets are illiquid, for two distinct reasons.  First, 

some of the assets are likely to have stale prices--that is, not to have been recently 

marked to market.  And, second, if most of a fund’s assets are illiquid securities, its 


 - 6 - 

manager will be inclined to accommodate early exits by drawing down on the fund’s cash 

reserve while planning to sell securities and replenish the cash stock later.  

Why, at the end of the day, should one care if run-like incentives come 

predominantly from the strategic behavior of fund investors, as opposed to that of fund 

managers?  Isn’t there the same worrisome fragility in either case?  Perhaps, but the 

policy response may differ depending on the exact diagnosis.  In the former case, when 

the primary worry is AUM runs on the part of investors, there is at least in principle a 

natural regulatory fix:  One could impose exit fees on open-end funds that are related to 

the illiquidity of the funds’ assets, in an effort to make departing investors more fully 

internalize the costs that they impose on those who stay behind.  In the latter case, when 

the problem is driven more by the portfolio choices of fund managers, it is harder for me 

to see an obvious regulatory response, so I am more inclined to share the authors’ view 

that if there is, indeed, a significant financial stability problem, monetary policy would be 

left to take up some of the slack. 

To be clear, I am not advocating for exit fees of the sort I just described; I do not 

think we know enough about the empirical relevance of the AUM-run mechanism, to say 

nothing of its quantitative importance, to be making such recommendations at this point.  

But, given the detailed nature of the microdata that are available on individual fund 

holdings and returns, there is clearly room to make significant further progress on this 

front.  Indeed, recent work by Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang is very much in this spirit, 

although it restricts its analysis to equity funds and doesn’t consider the fixed-income 

categories that are the focus of the current paper.

With this framing in mind, let me comment briefly on the empirical work in the 

paper.  There is a lot of it, and I will just touch on a couple of points.  A first observation 

is that the heavy focus on flows in and out of funds is a bit at odds with the theoretical 

model.  As I mentioned earlier, the model, taken literally, is one of closed-end funds with 

fixed AUM.  If one were interested in testing the specific mechanism in the model most 

directly, it seems to me that one would want to look not at fund flows but rather at the 

portfolio allocations within each fund.  For example, the model suggests that, during the 

unfolding of an episode of bond market volatility like the one in the spring and summer 

of last year, we should see a coordinated shift among bond managers out of long-term 

bonds and into bills so that the average durations of their portfolios would co-move 

strongly together.  There is a well-developed empirical literature on herding among fund 

managers in their portfolio allocations, but, as far as I know, this work has not looked at 

how such herding responds to changes in the monetary policy environment.
8
  So this 

avenue seems like a potentially promising one to pursue. 

The paper’s focus on flows in and out of funds is, however, well suited to 

thinking about mechanisms related to AUM-run dynamics.  In this regard, a particularly 

interesting set of findings has to do with the ability of flows to forecast future asset 

returns, even controlling for past returns.  And, most notably, this forecasting effect is 

much stronger in the less liquid high-yield and emerging market categories than it is in 

U.S. Treasury securities; indeed, it is essentially nonexistent in the latter category.  While 

not a decisive test, this pattern is consistent with one of the necessary preconditions for 

the existence of strategic complementarities and run-like dynamics.  Again, the key idea

is that, when a fund’s assets are illiquid, outflows today are met in part with drawdowns 

from cash reserves, with the other assets being sold off more gradually over time--hence, 

the predictable downward pressure on prices going forward.  This predictability is what 

creates the incentive for any given investor to pull out quickly if he or she sees a large 

number of co-investors pulling out.
9
 

Let me summarize by noting the areas in which I agree most closely with the 

authors and by adding one key qualification.  First, I think they are absolutely on target in 

emphasizing that the rapid growth of fixed-income funds--as well as other, similar 

vehicles--bears careful watching.  As they point out, it would be a mistake to be 

complacent about this phenomenon simply because such funds are unlevered.  Other 

economic mechanisms can mimic the run-like incentives associated with short-term debt 

financing, and one or more of these mechanisms may well be present in fixed-income 

funds. 

Second, I also agree that there is no general separation principle for monetary 

policy and financial stability.  Monetary policy is fundamentally in the business of 

altering risk premiums such as term premiums and credit spreads.  So monetary 

policymakers cannot wash their hands of what happens when these spreads revert 

sharply.  If these abrupt reversions also turn out to have nontrivial economic 

consequences, then they are clearly of potential relevance to policymakers. 

My one qualification is as follows:  In the absence of a general separation 

principle, when one might consider addressing financial stability issues either with 

                                                 
9
 Indeed, the results in the paper closely parallel those in Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang (2010), who find that 

fund flows forecast future returns more strongly among those equity funds that hold relatively illiquid 

stocks (for example, small-cap stocks).  Moreover, Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang cast their regressions as 

being an explicit test of the strategic-complementarity hypothesis.

regulation or with monetary policy, it becomes all the more critical to get the case-by-

case analysis right--that is, to really dig into the microeconomic details of the presumed 

market failure and to ask when a regulatory intervention is comparatively more efficient 

than a monetary one, or vice versa.  So while I think it is important to remain heterodox 

and to be open to taking either approach, I would not want to rule out the possibility that 

some of the risks identified by the authors could be mitigated, at least in part, via a 

regulatory approach.  I look forward to seeing more work that helps us sort through these 

challenging issues.
