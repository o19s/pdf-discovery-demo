May 3, 2013 





More than five years after the failure of Bear Stearns marked an escalation of the 

financial crisis, and nearly three years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, debate 

continues over the appropriate set of policy responses to protect against financial 

instability.  In recent months, there has been, in particular, a renewal of interest in 

additional measures to address the too-big-to-fail problem.  In some respects, the 

persistence of debate is unsurprising.  After all, the severity of the crisis and ensuing 

recession, and the frustratingly slow pace of economic recovery, have properly 

occasioned much thought about the structure of the financial system and the 

fundamentals of financial regulation.   

 Continuing discussion of these issues is part of a protracted policy debate over 

financial regulatory reform.  Some argue that little has changed and that the needed 

reform is a single, dramatic policy change (though that single policy differs considerably 

among those taking this view).  Others argue that reforms already enacted are sufficient 

to ensure financial stability.  Still others contend that there has already been too much of 

a regulatory response, which is suppressing credit extension and faster economic 

recovery.   

 I think most of us would acknowledge, upon reflection, that a good bit has been 

done, or at least put in motion, to counteract the problems of too-big-to-fail and systemic 

risk more generally.  At the same time, I believe that more is needed, particularly in 

addressing the risks posed by short-term wholesale funding markets.  This afternoon I 

would like both to highlight the importance of what has already been accomplished and, 

at somewhat greater length, to identify what I believe to be the key steps that remain.  

Before turning to these subjects, though, I begin with a brief reprise of the origins of the 


 - 2 - 

financial crisis, to remind ourselves of the vulnerabilities that led to the crisis and that 

remain of concern today.  It should, but does not always, go without saying that proposed 

solutions should actually help solve the problems at hand, and do so in a manner that 

minimizes the costs to otherwise productive activities.   

Vulnerabilities Exposed by the Crisis 

Beginning in the 1970s, the separation of traditional lending and capital markets 

activities established by New Deal financial regulation began to break down under the 

weight of macroeconomic turbulence, technological and business innovation, and 

competition.  During the succeeding three decades these activities became progressively 

more integrated, fueling the expansion of what has become known as the shadow banking 

system, including the explosive growth of securitization and derivative instruments in the 

first decade of this century.  

This trend entailed two major changes.  First, it diminished the importance of 

deposits as a source of funding for credit intermediation, in favor of capital market 

instruments sold to institutional investors.  Over time, these markets began to serve some 

of the same maturity transformation functions as the traditional banking systems, which 

in turn led to both an expansion and alteration of traditional money markets.  Ultimately, 

there was a vast increase in the creation of so-called cash equivalent instruments, which 

were supposedly safe, short-term, and liquid.  Second, this trend altered the structure of 

the industry, both transforming the activities of broker-dealers and fostering the 

emergence of large financial conglomerates. 

There was, in fact, a symbiotic relationship between the growth of large financial 

conglomerates and the shadow banking system.  Large banks sponsored shadow banking 


 - 3 - 

entities such as Structured Investment Vehicles (SIVs), money market funds, asset-

backed commercial paper conduits, and auction rate securities.  These firms also 

dominated the underwriting of assets purchased by entities within the shadow banking 

system. 

Though motivated in part by regulatory arbitrage, these developments were driven 

by more than regulatory evasion.  The growth and deepening of capital markets lowered 

financing costs for many companies and, through innovations such as securitization, 

helped expand the availability of capital for mortgage lending.  Similarly, the rise of 

institutional investors as guardians of household savings made a wide array of investment 

and savings products available to a much greater portion of the American public.  

But these changes also helped accelerate the fracturing of the system established 

in the 1930s.  While the increasingly outmoded regulation of earlier decades was eroded, 

no new regulatory mechanisms were put in place to control new risks.  When, in 2007, 

questions arose about the quality of some of the assets on which the shadow banking 

system was based--notably, those tied to poorly underwritten subprime mortgages--a 

classic adverse feedback loop ensued.  Investors formerly willing to lend against almost 

any asset on a short-term, secured basis were suddenly unwilling to lend against a wide 

range of assets, notably including the structured products that had become central to the 

shadow banking system.  Liquidity-strained institutions found themselves forced to sell 

positions, which placed additional downward pressure on asset prices, thereby 

accelerating margin calls on leveraged actors and amplifying mark-to-market losses for 

all holders of the assets.  The margin calls and booked losses would start another round in 

the adverse feedback loop.  


 - 4 - 

Severe repercussions were felt throughout the financial system, as short-term 

wholesale lending against all but the very safest collateral froze up, regardless of the 

identity of the borrower.  Moreover, as demonstrated by the intervention of the 

government when Bear Stearns and AIG were failing, and by the aftermath of Lehman 

Brothers’ failure, the universe of financial firms that appeared too-big-to-fail during 

periods of stress extended beyond the perimeter of traditional safety and soundness 

regulation.   

In short, the financial industry in the years preceding the crisis had been 

transformed into one that was highly vulnerable to runs on the short-term, uninsured cash 

equivalents that fed the new system’s reliance on wholesale funding.  The relationship 

between large firms and shadow banking meant that strains on wholesale funding markets 

could both reflect and magnify the too-big-to-fail problem.  These were not the relatively 

slow-developing problems of the Latin American debt crisis, or even the savings and loan 

crisis, but fast-moving episodes that risked turning liquidity problems into insolvency 

problems almost literally overnight.   

However, note that while the presence of too-big-to-fail institutions substantially 

exacerbates the vulnerability created by the new system, they do not define its limits.  

Even in the absence of any firm that may individually seem too big or too interconnected 

to be allowed to fail, the financial system can be vulnerable to contagion.  An external 

shock to important asset classes can lead to substantial uncertainty as to underlying 

values, a consequent reluctance by investors to provide short-term funding to firms 

holding those assets, a subsequent spate of fire sales and mark-to-market losses, and the 


 - 5 - 

potential for an adverse feedback loop.  An effective set of financial reforms must 

address both these related problems of too-big-to-fail and systemic vulnerability.   

Regulatory Response to Date 

 As is obvious from the scope of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act and the amount of activity at the regulatory agencies, reform 

efforts to date have been extensive.  They have also been significant.  Without trying to 

give a full review, let me draw your attention to some of the more notable 

accomplishments, which can be categorized in three groups. 

 First, the basic prudential framework for banking organizations is being 

considerably strengthened, both internationally and domestically.  Central to this effort 

are the Basel III changes to capital standards, which create a new requirement for a 

minimum common equity capital ratio.  This new standard requires substantial increases 

in both the quality and quantity of the loss-absorbing capital that allows a firm to remain 

a viable financial intermediary.  Basel III also established for the first time an 

international minimum leverage ratio which, unlike the traditional U.S. leverage 

requirement, takes account of off-balance-sheet items.   

 Second, a series of reforms have been targeted at the larger financial firms that are 

more likely to be of systemic importance.  When fully implemented, these measures will 

have formed a distinct regulatory and supervisory structure on top of generally applicable 

prudential regulations and supervisory requirements.  The governing principle for this 

new set of rules is that larger institutions should be subject to more exacting regulatory 

and supervisory requirements, which should become progressively stricter as the 

systemic importance of a firm increases.   


 - 6 - 

This principle has been codified in Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which 

requires special regulations applicable with increasing stringency to large banking 

organizations.
1
  Under this authority, the Federal Reserve will impose capital surcharges 

on the eight large U.S. banking organizations identified in the Basel Committee 

agreement for additional capital requirements on banking organizations of global 

systemic importance.  The size of a surcharge will vary depending on the relative 

systemic importance of the bank.  Other rules to be applied under Section 165—including 

counterparty credit risk limits, stress testing, and the quantitative short-term liquidity 

requirements included in the internationally-negotiated Liquidity Coverage Ratio 

(LCR)—will apply only to large institutions, in some cases with stricter standards for 

firms of greatest systemic importance.     

An important, related reform in Dodd-Frank was the creation of orderly 

liquidation authority, under which the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation can impose 

losses on a failed systemic institution’s shareholders and creditors and replace its 

management, while avoiding runs and preserving the operations of the sound, functioning 

parts of the firm.  This authority gives the government a real alternative to the Hobson’s 

choice of bailout or disorderly bankruptcy that authorities faced in 2008.  Similar 

resolution mechanisms are under development in other countries, and international 

consultations are underway to plan for cooperative efforts to resolve multinational 

financial firms. 

                                                 
1
 The operative statutory language reads as follows:  “In order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial 

stability of the United States that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing 

activities, of large, interconnected financial institutions, the Board of Governors shall . . . establish 

prudential standards for nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors and bank 

holding companies with total consolidated assets equal to or greater than [$50 billion] that . . . are more 

stringent than the standards and requirements applicable to [other regulated firms] and . . . increase in 

stringency.”   


 - 7 - 

A third set of reforms has been aimed at strengthening financial markets 

generally, without regard to the status of relevant market actors as regulated or 

systemically important.  The greatest focus, as mandated under Titles VII and VIII of 

Dodd-Frank, has been on making derivatives markets safer through requiring central 

clearing for derivatives that can be standardized and creating margin requirements for 

derivatives that continue to be written and traded outside of central clearing facilities.  

The relevant U.S. agencies are working with their international counterparts to produce 

an international arrangement that will harmonize these requirements so as to promote 

both global financial stability and competitive parity.  In addition, eight financial market 

utilities engaged in important payment, clearing, and settlement activities have been 

designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as systemically important and, 

thus, will now be subject to enhanced supervision. 

As you can tell from my description, many of these reforms are still being refined 

or are still in the process of implementation.  The rather deliberate pace--occasioned as it 

is by the rather complicated domestic and international decisionmaking processes--may 

be obscuring the significance of what will be far-reaching change in the regulation of 

financial firms and markets.  Indeed, even without full implementation of all the new 

regulations, the Federal Reserve has already used its stress-test and capital-planning 

exercises to prompt a doubling in the last four years of the common equity capital of the 

nation’s 18 largest bank holding companies, which hold more than 70 percent of the total 

assets of all U.S. bank holding companies.  The weighted tier 1 common equity ratio, 

which compares high-quality capital to risk-weighted assets, of these 18 firms rose from 

5.6 percent at the end of 2008 to 11.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012, reflecting an 


 - 8 - 

increase in tier 1 common equity from $393 billion to $792 billion during the same 

period.  

Gaps in Regulatory Reform 

Despite this considerable progress, we have not yet adequately addressed all the 

vulnerabilities that developed in our financial system in the decades preceding the crisis.  

Most importantly, relatively little has been done to change the structure of wholesale 

funding markets so as to make them less susceptible to damaging runs.  It is true that 

some of the clearly risky forms of wholesale funding that existed before the crisis, such 

as the infamous SIVs, have disappeared or substantially contracted.  But significant 

continuing vulnerability remains, particularly in those funding channels that can be 

grouped under the heading of securities financing transactions (SFTs).
2
   

Repo, reverse repo, securities lending and borrowing, and securities margin 

lending are part of the healthy functioning of the securities market.  But, in the absence of 

sensible regulation, they are also potentially associated with the dynamic I described 

earlier of exogenous shocks to asset values leading to an adverse feedback loop of mark-

to-market losses, margin calls, and fire sales.  Indeed, some have argued that this 

dynamic is exacerbated by a “maturity rat race,” in which each creditor acts to shorten the 

maturity of its lending so as to facilitate quick and easy flight, and in which creditors pay 

relatively little attention to the recovery value of the underlying assets.
3
   

                                                 
2
 For these reasons, there has been an instinct to address various aspects of wholesale funding discretely.  

Hence the attention paid by the Federal Reserve and other regulators to money market funds, and the steps 

taken by the Federal Reserve to reduce the risks associated with the extension of intraday credit by clearing 

banks in triparty repo funding markets.  These discrete steps are useful, particularly insofar as they cast 

light on implicit, but unpriced, support for short-term funding that has been provided by some financial 

intermediaries.  But they do not address head-on the dynamic described in the text.

With respect to the too-big-to-fail problem, as I noted earlier, actual capital levels 

are substantially higher than before the crisis, and requirements to extend and maintain 

higher levels of capital are on the way.  The regularization and refinement of rigorous 

stress testing may be the single most important supervisory improvement to strengthen 

the resilience of large institutions.  The creation of orderly liquidation authority and the 

process of resolution planning advance prospects for increasing market discipline.  But 

questions remain as to whether all this is enough to contain the problem.  The enduring 

potential fragility of a financial system substantially dependent on short-term wholesale 

funding is especially relevant in considering the impact of severe stress or failure at the 

very large institutions with very large amounts of such funding.   

Concern about the adequacy of policy responses to date is supported by some 

recent research that attempts to quantify the implicit funding subsidy enjoyed by certain 

institutions by looking to such factors as credit ratings uplifts, differentials in interest 

rates paid on deposits or in risk compensation for bank debt and equity, and premia paid 

for mergers that would arguably place the merged firm in the too-big-to-fail category.
4
  

The calculation of a precise subsidy is difficult, and each such effort will likely occasion 

substantial disagreement.  But several measures provide at least directionally consistent 

results.

 See, for example, Kenichi Ueda and Beatrice Weder di Mauro (2012), “Quantifying Structural Subsidy 

Values for Systemically Important Financial Institutions,” International Monetary Fund Working Paper 

(May); Stefan Jacewitz and Jonathan Pogach (2013), “Deposit Rate Advantages at the Largest Banks,” 

FDIC Working Paper (April 16);  Dale Gray and Andreas A. Jobst (2010),  “New Directions in Financial 

Sector and Sovereign Risk Management,” Journal of Investment Management, vol. 8, no. 1, pp. 23-38; and 

Elijah Brewer II and Julapa Jagtiani (2013), “How Much Did Banks Pay to Become Too-Big-To-Fail and 

to Become Systemically Important?” Journal of Financial Services Research, vol. 43, pp. 1-35.  Estimating 

the exact size of this funding advantage depends on a number of assumptions as well as contemporaneous 

market conditions and is difficult to quantify robustly.  Estimates must consider a number of factors, 

including market participants’ beliefs about the likelihood of an institution’s failure, the value of a 

government bailout of debt holders were it to occur, and the likelihood that the government would actually 

choose to bail out debt holders in the event of a failure.

Key Additional Reform Measures 

 In sketching out the kinds of steps needed to address these remaining 

vulnerabilities, let me begin with wholesale funding generally, and then circle back to 

too-big-to-fail.    

Short-Term Wholesale Funding.  At a conceptual level, the policy goal is fairly 

easy to state: a regulatory charge or other measure that applies more or less 

comprehensively to all uses of short-term wholesale funding, without regard to the form 

of the transactions or whether the borrower was a prudentially regulated institution.  The 

aspiration to comprehensiveness is important for two reasons.  First, the risks associated 

with short-term funding are as much or more macroprudential as they are firm-specific.  

From a microprudential perspective, SFTs are low risk, because the borrowing is short-

dated, overcollateralized, marked-to-market daily, and subject to remargining 

requirements.  The dangers arise in the tail and apply to the entire financial market when 

the normally safe, short-term lending contracts dramatically in the face of sudden and 

significant uncertainty about asset values and the condition of counterparties.  A 

regulatory measure should force some internalization by market actors of the systemic 

costs of this intermediation.   

Second, to the degree that regulatory measures apply only to some types of 

wholesale funding, or only to that used by prudentially regulated entities, there will be a 

growing risk of regulatory arbitrage.  Ideally, the regulatory charge should apply whether 

the borrower is a commercial bank, broker-dealer, agency Real Estate Investment Trust 

(REIT), or hedge fund. 


 - 11 - 

 Stating the goal is easy, but executing it is not, precisely because short-term 

wholesale funding is used in a variety of forms by a variety of market actors.  

Determining appropriately equivalent controls is a challenging task and, with respect to 

institutions not subject to prudential regulation, there may be questions as to where--if at 

all--current regulatory authority resides.  And, of course, there is the overarching problem 

of calibrating the regulation so as to mitigate the systemic risks associated with these 

funding markets, while not suppressing the mechanisms that have become important parts 

of the modern financial system in providing liquidity and lowering borrowing costs for 

both financial and non-financial firms.  For all these reasons, it may well be that the 

abstract desirability of a single, comprehensive regulatory measure may not be achievable 

in the near term.    

 Still, at least as a starting point, we would do well to consider measures that apply 

broadly.  One option is to change minimum requirements for capital, liquidity, or both at 

all regulated firms so as to realize a macroprudential, as well as microprudential, purpose.  

In their current form, existing and planned liquidity requirements produced by the Basel 

Committee aim mostly to encourage maturity-matched books.  While maturity mismatch 

by core intermediaries is a key financial stability risk in wholesale funding markets, it is 

not the only one.  Even if an intermediary’s book of securities financing transactions is 

perfectly matched, a reduction in its access to funding can force the firm to engage in 

asset fire sales or to abruptly withdraw credit from customers.  The intermediary’s 

customers are likely to be highly leveraged and maturity transforming financial firms as 

well, and, therefore, may then have to engage in fire sales themselves.  The direct and 


 - 12 - 

indirect contagion risks are high.  Thus, the long-term and short-term liquidity ratios 

might be refashioned so as to address directly the risks of large SFT books. 

 Similarly, existing bank and broker-dealer risk-based capital rules do not reflect 

fully the financial stability risks associated with SFTs.  Accordingly, higher, generally 

applicable capital charge applied to SFTs might be a useful piece of a complementary set 

of macroprudential measures, though an indirect measure like a capital charge might have 

to be quite large to create adequate incentive to temper the use of short-term wholesale 

funding.   

By definition, both liquidity and capital requirements would be limited to banking 

entities already within the perimeter of prudential regulation.  The obvious questions are 

whether these firms at present occupy enough of the wholesale funding markets that 

standards applicable only to them would be reasonably effective in addressing systemic 

risk and, even if that question is answered affirmatively, whether the imposition of such 

standards would soon lead to significant arbitrage through increased participation by 

those outside the regulatory circle. 

 In part for these reasons, a second possibility that has received considerable 

attention is a universal minimum margining requirement applicable directly to SFTs.  The 

Financial Stability Board has already issued a consultative paper, and received public 

comment, on the idea.  Under such a regime, all repo lenders, for example, could be 

required to take a minimum amount of over-collateralization as determined by regulators 

(the amount varying with the nature of the securities collateral), regardless of whether the 

repo lender or repo borrower were otherwise prudentially regulated.  This kind of 

requirement could be an effective tool to limit procyclicality in securities financing and, 


 - 13 - 

thereby, to contain the risks of runs and contagion.  Of course, it also raises many of the 

issues that make settling on a single policy instrument so hard to achieve,
5
 and the 

decision on calibration would be particularly consequential.  Still, the concept has much 

to be said for it and seems the most promising avenue toward satisfying the principle of 

comprehensiveness.  It is definitely worth pursuing. 

 As you can tell, there is not yet a blueprint for addressing the basic vulnerabilities 

in short-term wholesale funding markets.  Accordingly, the risks of runs and contagion 

remain.  For the present, we can continue to work on discrete aspects of these markets, 

such as through the diminution of reliance on intraday credit in triparty repo markets that 

is being achieved by Federal Reserve supervision of clearing banks and through the 

money market fund reforms that I expect will be pursued by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission.  We might also think about less comprehensive measures affecting SFTs, 

such as limits on rehypothecation, when an institution uses assets that have been posted 

as collateral by its clients for its own purposes.
6
  But I do not think that the post-crisis 

program of regulatory reform can be judged complete until a more comprehensive set of 

measures to address this problem is in place. 

 Too-Big-to-Fail.  Before discussing policies specifically directed at too-big-to-

fail, let me say a word about the capital regime that should be applicable to all banks, on 

                                                 
5
 To give just one example:  Securities lending sometimes involves an exchange of securities for securities 

and sometimes involves an exchange of cash for securities.  Determining whether and/or how to apply a 

universal margining requirement to securities lending transactions of both varieties would be challenging. 
6
 Rehypothecation of fully paid customer securities held by broker-dealers not only permits a kind of 

money creation by broker-dealers, it also can put the securities of the customer at risk, as was seen after the 

Lehman failure, when some clients found that their securities had been reused by the firm’s London office 

in a way that made them difficult to reclaim.  In the United States, the Securities and Exchange 

Commission has long limited, though not prohibited, rehypothecation of customer securities.  Other 

countries may try to limit the practice informally, but have no formal rules.  Given the combined 

macroprudential and investor protection concerns raised by rehypothecation, a review of current U.S. 

limits, and the adoption of rules by other relevant countries, seems a logical and, relative to some other 

proposals, feasible step. 


 - 14 - 

top of which any additional requirements for systemically important institutions would be 

built.  The first order of business is to complete the Basel III rulemaking as soon as 

possible.  The required increases in the quality and quantity of minimum capital, and the 

introduction of an international leverage ratio, represent important steps forward for 

banking regulation around the world.  U.S. banks have increased their capital 

substantially since the financial crisis began, and the vast majority already have Tier 1 

common risk-based ratios greater than the Basel III 7 percent requirements 

The new requirements, while big improvements, are not as high as I would have 

liked, and the agreement contains some provisions I would have omitted or simplified.  In 

coming years we may well seek changes.  Indeed, I continue to be a strong advocate of 

establishing simpler, standardized risk-based capital requirements and am encouraged at 

the initial work being done on the topic of simplification in the Basel Committee.  And 

we will certainly simplify the final capital rules here in the United States so as to respond 

to the concerns expressed by smaller banks.  But opposing, or seeking delay in, Basel III 

would simply give an excuse to banks that do not meet Basel III standards to seek delay 

from their own governments.  It would be ironic indeed if those who favor higher or 

simpler capital requirements were unintentionally to lend assistance to banks that want to 

avoid strengthening their capital positions. 

Turning to specific policies to address too-big-to-fail, the first task is to 

implement fully the capital surcharge for systemically important institutions, the LCR, 

resolution plans, and other relevant proposed regulations.  But, completion of this agenda, 

significant as it is, would leave more too-big-to-fail risk than I think is prudent.  What 

more, then, should be done?  As I have said before, proposals to impose across-the-board 


 - 15 - 

size caps or structural limitations on banks--whatever their merits and demerits--embody 

basic policy decisions that are properly the province of Congress. 
7
 

However, that does not mean there is no role for regulators.  On the contrary, 

Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Federal Reserve the authority, and the 

obligation, to apply regulations of increasing stringency to large banking organizations in 

order to mitigate risks to financial stability.  In any event, it is unlikely that the problems 

associated with too-big-to-fail institutions can be efficiently ameliorated using a single 

regulatory tool.  The explicit expectation in Section 165 that there will be a variety of 

enhanced standards seems well-advised.  We should be considering ways to use this 

authority in pursuit of three complementary ends: (1) ensuring the loss absorbency 

needed for a credible and effective resolution process, (2) augmenting the going-concern 

capital of the largest firms, and (3) addressing the systemic risks associated with the use 

of wholesale funding.     

There is clear need for a requirement that large financial institutions have 

minimum amounts of long-term unsecured debt that could be converted to equity and 

thereby be available to absorb losses in the event of insolvency.  Although the details 

will, as always, be important, there appears to be an emerging consensus among 

regulators, both here and abroad, in support of the general idea.  Debt subject to this kind 

of bail-in would supplement the increased regulatory capital in order to provide greater 

assurance that, should the firm become insolvent, all losses could be borne using 

resources within the firm.  This requirement for additional “gone concern” capital would

increase the prospects for orderly resolution and, thereby, counteract the moral hazard 

associated with expectations of taxpayer bailouts.  Switzerland has already adopted a 

requirement of this sort, and similar proposals are being actively debated in the European 

Union.  A U.S. requirement, enacted under the Federal Reserve’s Section 165 authority, 

would both strengthen our domestic resolution mechanisms and be consistent with 

emerging international practice. 

 With respect to “going concern” capital requirements, there is a good case for 

additional measures to increase the chances that large financial institutions remain viable 

financial intermediaries even under stress.  To me, at least, the important question is not 

whether capital requirements for large banking firms need to be stronger than those 

included in Basel III and the agreement on capital surcharges, but how to make them so 

and with what specific risks in mind.  In this regard, I would observe that our stress tests 

and capital-planning requirements have already strengthened capital standards by making 

them more forward-looking and more responsive to economic developments.  As we gain 

experience, and as the annual process becomes smoother for both the banks and the 

Federal Reserve, we have the opportunity to enhance the stress tests by, for example, 

varying the scenario for stressing the trading books of the largest firms, so as to reflect 

changes in the composition of those books. 

As to regulatory measures of capital outside the customized context of stress 

testing, one approach is to revisit the calibration of two existing capital measures 

applicable to the largest firms.  The first is the leverage ratio.  U.S. regulatory practice 

has traditionally maintained a complementary relationship between the greater sensitivity 

of risk-based capital requirements and the check provided by the leverage ratio on too 


 - 17 - 

much leverage arising from low-risk-weighted assets.  This relationship has obviously 

been changed by the substantial increase in the risk-based ratio resulting from the new 

minimum and conservation buffer requirements of Basel III.  The existing U.S. leverage 

ratio does not take account of off-balance-sheet assets, which are significant for many of 

the largest firms.  The new Basel III leverage ratio does include off-balance-sheet assets, 

but it may have been set too low.  Thus, the traditional complementarity of the capital 

ratios might be maintained by using Section 165 to set a higher leverage ratio for the 

largest firms.   

The other capital measure that might be revisited is the risk-based capital 

surcharge mechanism. The amounts of the surcharges eventually agreed to in Basel were 

at the lower end of the range needed to achieve the aim of reducing the probability of 

these firms’ failures enough to offset fully the greater impact their failure would have on 

the financial system.  At the time these surcharges were being negotiated, I favored a 

somewhat greater requirement for the largest, most interconnected firms.
8
  Here, after all, 

is where the potential for negative externalities is the greatest, while the marginal benefits 

accruing from scale and scope economies are hardest to discern.  While it is clearly 

preferable at this point to implement what we have agreed, rather than to seek changes 

that could delay any additional capital requirement, it may be desirable for the Basel 

Committee to return to this calibration issue sooner rather than later. 

The area in which the most work is needed is in addressing the risks arising from 

the use of short-term wholesale funding by systemically important firms.  The systemic

risks associated with runs on wholesale funding would, almost by definition, be 

exacerbated if a very large user of that funding were to come under serious stress.  There 

could also be greater negative externalities from a disruption of large, matched SFT 

positions on the books of a major financial firm than if the same total activity were spread 

among a greater number of dealers.  Thus, in keeping with the principle of differential 

and increasingly stringent regulation for large firms, there is a strong case to be made for 

taking steps beyond any generally applicable measures that are eventually applied to 

SFTs or short-term wholesale funding more generally.   

One possibility would be to have progressively greater minimum liquidity 

requirements for larger institutions under the LCR and the still-under-construction Net 

Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR).

  There is certainly some appeal to following this route, 

since it would build on all the work done in fashioning these liquidity requirements.  The 

only significant additional task would be calibrating the progressivity structure.  

However, there are at least two disadvantages to this approach.  First, the LCR and, at 

least at this stage of its development, the NSFR, both rest on the implicit presumption 

that a firm with a perfectly matched book is in a fundamentally stable position.  As a 

microprudential matter, this is probably a reasonable assumption.  But under some 

conditions, the disorderly unwind of a single, large SFT book, even one that was quite 

well maturity matched, could set off the kind of unfavorable dynamic described earlier.  

Second, creating liquidity levels substantially higher than those contemplated in the LCR 

and eventual NSFR may not be the most efficient way for some firms to become better

insulated from the run risk that can lead to the adverse feedback loop and contagion 

possibilities discussed earlier. 

A more interesting approach would be to tie liquidity and capital standards 

together by requiring higher levels of capital for large firms unless their liquidity position 

is substantially stronger than minimum requirements.  This approach would reflect the 

fact that the market perception of a given firm’s position as counterparty depends upon 

the combination of its funding position and capital levels.  It would also supplement the 

Basel capital surcharge system, which does not include use of short-term wholesale 

funding among the factors used to calculate the systemic “footprint” of each firm, and 

thus determine its relative surcharge.   

 While there is decidedly a need for solid minimum requirements for both capital 

and liquidity, the relationship between the two also matters.  Where a firm has little need 

of short-term funding to maintain its ongoing business, it is less susceptible to runs.  

Where, on the other hand, a firm is significantly dependent on such funding, it may need 

considerable common equity capital to convince market actors that it is indeed solvent.  

Similarly, the greater or lesser use of short-term funding helps define a firm’s relative 

contribution to the systemic risk latent in these markets.  

If realized, this approach would allow a firm of systemic importance to choose 

between holding capital in greater amounts than would otherwise be required, or 

changing the amount and composition of its liabilities in order to reduce the contribution 

it could make to systemic risk in the event of a shock to short-term funding channels.  

The additional capital requirements might be tied, for example, to specified scores under 

an NSFR that had been reworked significantly so as to take account of the 


 - 20 - 

macroprudential implications of wholesale funding discussed earlier.  If one wished to 

maintain the practice of grounding capital requirements in measures of assets, another 

possibility would be to add as a capital surcharge a specified percentage of assets 

measured so as to weight most heavily those associated with short-term funding.  

To provide a meaningful counterweight to the risks associated with wholesale 

funding runs, the additional capital requirement would have to be material.   The highest 

requirement would be at just the point where a firm had the minimum required level of 

liquidity.  The requirement then would diminish as the liquidity score of the firm rose 

sufficiently above minimum required levels.  If the requirement were significant enough 

and likely to apply to any large institution with substantial capital market activities, it 

might also be a substitute for increasing the capital surcharge schedule already agreed to 

in Basel.   

I readily acknowledge that calibrating the relationship would not be easy, and that 

the stakes for both financial stability and financial efficiency in getting it right would be 

significant.  But I think this approach is worth exploring, precisely because it rests upon 

the link between too-big-to-fail concerns and the runs and contagion that we experienced 

five years ago, and to which we remain vulnerable today.  Whether it proves feasible, or 

whether we would have to fall back on the more straightforward approach of 

strengthening liquidity requirements for systemically important firms, the key point is 

that the principle of increasing stringency be applied. 

Conclusion 

 Of late I find myself of two minds on the question of bringing to a close the major 

elements of regulatory change following the financial crisis.  On the one hand, I strongly 


 - 21 - 

believe that all the regulatory agencies should complete as soon as possible the remaining 

rulemakings generated by Dodd-Frank and Basel III.  It is important that banks and other 

financial market actors know the rules that will govern capital standards, proprietary 

trading, mortgage lending, and other activities.  In fact, we should monitor whether these 

rules end up having significant unintended effects on credit availability and, if so, modify 

them in a manner consistent with basic aims of safety and soundness and consumer 

protection. 

On the other hand, I equally strongly believe that we would do the American 

public a fundamental disservice were we to declare victory without tackling the structural 

weaknesses of short-term wholesale funding markets, both in general and as they affect 

the too-big-to-fail problem.  This is the major problem that remains, and I would suggest 

that additional reform measures be evaluated by reference to how effective they could be 

in solving it.
