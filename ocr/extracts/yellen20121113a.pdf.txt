Revolution and Evolution in Central Bank Communications

November 13, 2012 


Thank you.  I’m delighted to be back at Haas, which I’ve been proud to call home 

for much of my career.  I’d like to thank Dean Lyons for inviting me to speak to you this 

afternoon.1  

My subject is the recent revolution and continuing evolution in communication by 

central banks.  All of us, of course, live in an era of revolutionary advances in 

communication:  If I succeed in saying anything interesting this afternoon, those words 

may be posted, tweeted, and blogged about even before I’ve left this podium.  So, it 

might seem unsurprising that the Federal Reserve, too, is bolstering its efforts at 

communication.   

But the revolution in central bank communication is not driven by technological 

advances.  Rather, it is the product of advances in our understanding of how to make 

monetary policy most effective.  A growing body of research and experience 

demonstrates that clear communication is itself a vital tool for increasing the efficacy and 

reliability of monetary policy.  In fact, the challenges facing our economy in the wake of 

the financial crisis have made clear communication more important than ever before.  

Today I’ll discuss the revolution in thinking about central bank transparency and how, 

pushed by the unique situation precipitated by the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve 

has responded with fundamental advances in communication.  Indeed, I hope that one of 

the legacies of this difficult period is a permanent and substantial advance in Federal 

Reserve transparency, building on the policies I’ll talk about shortly.   

As you all know, the Federal Reserve is actively promoting a faster recovery.  Our 

efforts are hampered by the fact that our standard policy tool, the federal funds rate, is

contributed to the preparation of these remarks.

near zero and cannot be reduced much further.  In this extraordinary environment, the 

Federal Reserve is employing two unconventional policy tools to spur job creation and 

growth:  large-scale asset purchases, which some people call quantitative easing, and 

communications about the future course of monetary policy, also known as forward 

guidance.  

At the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) meeting in September, the 

FOMC--the Federal Reserve’s principal monetary policymaking body--employed both of 

these unconventional tools.  The Committee initiated a new large-scale asset purchase 

program to buy mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  In addition, with regard to forward 

guidance, the Committee said that, first, it intends to continue buying MBS and other 

assets until it sees a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.2  

Second, the Committee stated that it expects a highly accommodative stance of monetary 

policy to remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery 

strengthens.  And third, the Committee noted that it currently expects to hold the federal 

funds rate at exceptionally low levels at least through mid-2015, about a half-year longer 

than previously announced.  

The three elements of forward guidance that were adopted by the FOMC in 

September 2012 would have been unthinkable in 1992 and greatly surprising in 2002, but 

they have, in my view, become a centerpiece of appropriate monetary policy.  To better 

explain my views regarding the FOMC’s forward guidance, I will first discuss how it fits 

into the Committee’s broader thinking and communication about monetary policy.  The 

                                                 
2 The September FOMC meeting statement further indicates that the Committee will take account of the 
likely efficacy and costs of such purchases in determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset 
purchases.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC 
Statement,” press release, September 13,

FOMC took a major step to explain this thinking last January when it issued for the first 

time a “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy.”3  This statement provides a 

concise description of the FOMC’s objectives in conducting monetary policy and the 

approach the Committee considers appropriate to achieve them.  I will present my views 

on the implications of this statement for monetary policy in current circumstances.  I will 

then discuss several approaches the FOMC has recently considered to enhance its 

communications to make its policy more effective in this challenging situation.  Let me 

emphasize that the views I express here are my own and do not necessarily represent 

those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System.  

The Case for Central Bank Transparency 

To fully appreciate the recent revolution in central bank communication and its 

implications for current policy, it is useful to recall that for decades, the conventional 

wisdom was that secrecy about the central bank’s goals and actions actually makes 

monetary policy more effective.  In 1977, when I started my first job at the Federal 

Reserve Board as a staff economist in the Division of International Finance, it was an 

article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the 

best policy:  Central banks, as a rule, did not discuss these decisions, let alone their future 

policy intentions.  While the Federal Reserve is required by the Congress to promote 

                                                 
3 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement 
of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” press release, January 25, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm.  I should note that this statement 
grew out of discussions within the FOMC that date back to the early 1990s.  For a proposal from 2003 by 
the then Governor Bernanke, see Ben S. Bernanke (2003), “Panel Discussion,” speech delivered at the 28th 
Annual Policy Conference:  Inflation Targeting Prospects and Problems, Federal Reserve Bank of St. 
Louis, St. Louis, Missouri, October 17, 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2003/20031017/default.htm.  My own thinking on the issue 
has evolved over the years; for a snapshot of its state in early 2006, see Janet L. Yellen (2006), “Enhancing 
Fed Credibility,” speech delivered at the Annual Washington Policy Conference Sponsored by the National 
Association for Business Economics, Washington, March 13,

stable prices and maximum employment, Federal Reserve officials at that time avoided 

discussing how policy would be used to pursue both sides of this mandate.  Indeed, mere 

mention of the employment side of the mandate, even by the mid-1990s, was described in 

a New York Times article as the equivalent of “sticking needles in the eyes of central 

bankers.”4      

This secretiveness regarding monetary policy decisions clashed with the openness 

regarding government decisions expected in a democracy, especially since Federal 

Reserve decisions influence the lives of every American.  And there were critics within 

the economics profession.  James Tobin and Milton Friedman, both Nobel laureates, 

disagreed on almost every aspect of monetary policy, but they were united in arguing that 

transparency regarding central bank decisions is vital in a democracy to lend legitimacy 

to policy decisions.5  Surely only some important societal interest requiring opacity could 

justify the traditional practice.  Indeed, in 1975 a citizen demanding greater openness 

sued the FOMC to obtain immediate release of the policy directive upon its adoption, and 

in 1981 the case was resolved in favor of deferred disclosure.6   

Ironically, while this transparency lawsuit was wending its way through the 

courts, Robert Lucas and others were publishing research that would garner several 

Nobel prizes and ultimately overturn the traditional wisdom that secrecy regarding policy

actions was the best policy.7  A key insight of these scholars was that monetary policy 

affects employment, incomes, and inflation to a large extent through its effects on the 

public’s expectations about future policy.  Many spending decisions, such as financing 

the purchase of a home or businesses’ capital expenditures, depend on longer-term 

interest rates that are connected to monetary policy through expectations of short-term 

interest rates over the lifetime of a mortgage or an investment project.  In other words, the 

effect of monetary policy on the economy today depends not only, or even primarily, on 

the FOMC’s current target for the federal funds rate or the quantity of assets on its 

balance sheet, but rather on how the public expects the Federal Reserve to set the paths of 

these variables in the future.  These expectations influence longer-term interest rates and 

asset prices as well as the public’s views concerning the likely future paths of income and 

inflation.  

The history of oil price shocks is a good example to illustrate this point.  In the 

1970s, two large oil price shocks led to sharp increases in general inflation that were not 

met with prompt inflation-fighting actions by the Federal Reserve.  This delay left the 

public unsure whether the Federal Reserve would act to reverse the increase in inflation, 

and expectations of longer-term inflation ratcheted up.  When the Federal Reserve 

eventually did act to bring inflation down from double-digit levels, the consequence was 

the painful recession of 1981 and 1982.  

The effects of that policy shift were severe, but the decision helped change 

expectations of the Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability, and thereby 

ultimately led to longer-run inflation expectations becoming anchored at their current low 

                                                 
7 While Robert Lucas mainly analyzed models in which only monetary surprises have any effect on real 
activity, his important insight in the present context was that the perceived monetary policy rule is critical 
in determining the effects of monetary policy actions, both anticipated and unanticipated.

levels.  As a result, a series of large increases in oil prices starting in 2005 did not unleash 

a general rise in inflation or longer-term inflation expectations.  The public seemed to 

correctly perceive that the Federal Reserve would not allow an oil price shock to 

precipitate a general rise in inflation.  Longer-term inflation expectations remained well 

anchored, and hence no aggressive and recessionary disinflation action by the Federal 

Reserve was required.  Thus, over the quarter century up to the mid-2000s, the Federal 

Reserve established a record of policymaking that allowed the public to predict monetary 

policy responses to unforeseen events such as an oil price shock with reasonable 

accuracy.   

Unfortunately, recent events have made it harder for the public to predict the 

future course of monetary policy.  Economic weakness since the financial crisis and the 

Great Recession has confounded hopes for a speedy recovery and has required 

unprecedented monetary policy actions.  Shortly after the financial crisis erupted, the 

Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to almost zero and launched a number of 

temporary liquidity and credit programs to keep the financial system operating.  Even 

these aggressive policy responses, however, were not enough to halt the contraction, and 

further action was needed to stop the economy from falling into a second Great 

Depression.  To this end, the Federal Reserve started to expand its balance sheet through 

purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency debt and MBS in an effort to put 

further downward pressure on long-term interest rates and so stimulate the economy.   

With the federal funds rate near zero, and the Federal Reserve deploying the new 

tool of large-scale asset purchases, it became much more difficult for the public to 

anticipate how the FOMC would likely conduct policy over time, and how the overall 


- 7 - 
 

stance of monetary policy would both affect and respond to economic conditions.  In this 

situation, the FOMC began to rely heavily on forward guidance about both the likely 

future path of the federal funds rate and the Committee’s intentions concerning asset 

purchases and sales.8  But, for this guidance to have its maximum effect, it must be 

understood and believed by the public, and therefore provide the public with a solid basis 

for forming their borrowing and spending decisions today.9  In my view, such credibility 

can be achieved only if the public understands the FOMC’s objectives and intentions.   

Communications after the Financial Crisis 

Chairman Bernanke asked me to take up these challenges in 2010 as chair of a 

new FOMC communications subcommittee.10  Central bank transparency had long been 

an issue of great interest to both of us, and the Chairman had been an exceptionally 

strong voice for central bank transparency in his academic work and in his earlier service 

on the Board of Governors.  Throughout the Chairman’s term, the FOMC has made 

important strides in transparency through actions such as introducing the Committee’s 

quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which provides information about 

                                                 
8 The FOMC also provided information concerning its “exit strategy” in the minutes of its June 2011 
meeting (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2011), Minutes of the Federal Open 
Market Committee, June 21-22, www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20110622.pdf).  
The Committee indicated that it intends to normalize the size and composition of its balance sheet by 
selling off agency securities at a gradual pace after it begins the process of raising the federal funds rate.    
9 Economic theory suggests that the public’s expectations concerning the time path of the Federal Reserve’s 
asset holdings--which includes both the ultimate size of those holdings and the length of time that these 
assets will be retained on the Fed’s balance sheet--influence longer-term yields and the term premiums 
embedded in those yields today.  For empirical estimates of these effects see, for example, Canlin Li and 
Min Wei (2012), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large Scale 
Asset Purchase Programs,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2012-37 (Washington:  Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May),  
www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2012/201237/201237abs.html. 
10 Similar subcommittees acting in the early 1990s dealt with FOMC policies concerning the disclosure of 
the minutes and transcripts of FOMC meetings.  An FOMC subcommittee in 1999 laid the groundwork for 
the current FOMC postmeeting statements.  And a subcommittee appointed in 2006, led by the then Vice 
Chairman Kohn, considered the adoption of a numerical inflation objective and recommended 
enhancements that were incorporated in the Summary of Economic Projections.

participants’ forecasts for the economy under their individual views concerning 

appropriate policy and their longer-run assessments of potential output growth, the 

“normal” unemployment rate, and the most appropriate inflation rate.    

A high priority for the Chairman was to further clarify the FOMC’s interpretation 

of the long-term objectives implied by its dual mandate to promote maximum 

employment and stable prices.  While we had made progress, as I just noted, during the 

years preceding the crisis, the FOMC as a body had never provided an explicit 

description of its policy goals beyond quoting its mandate.  We saw further clarification 

of these objectives as important for the sake of transparency and accountability.  But 

beyond that, an explicit statement of goals had become essential for the Committee to 

achieve its monetary policy objectives in the aftermath of the crisis, including allowing 

heavier reliance than in the past on forward guidance on the future path of policy.   

A particular concern, given that the crisis had ushered in a prolonged period of 

elevated unemployment, was that the weakness in the economy might push inflation well 

below 2 percent, a level that many took to be an implicit target of the FOMC.  There was 

even an ongoing risk that low inflation might turn to deflation and further hamper 

growth.  These challenges led to legitimate questions among forecasters and the public 

about just what the FOMC meant by “maximum employment” and “stable prices.”   

 The FOMC could have chosen to adopt an “inflation-targeting framework,” in 

which it would have specified an objective solely for inflation, without any explicit 

reference to employment.  Such an approach has been adopted by a large number of 

central banks since the 1990s.  While the FOMC had debated adopting an inflation target 

on a number of occasions since the mid-1990s, some Committee members believed that 


- 9 - 
 

stating an explicit target for inflation alone would undermine the maximum-employment 

side of the dual mandate.  In fact, some central banks that have been assigned a single 

mandate of inflation stabilization have struggled to explain how the goals of growth and 

financial stability figure into their inflation-targeting framework.11 

A Consensus on Monetary Policy Goals 

Last January, the FOMC took a major step to clarify its interpretation of its dual 

mandate, issuing the “Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy” 

that I mentioned earlier.  Unlike the regular postmeeting statements, which are intended 

to remain current only until the next FOMC meeting, this statement is meant to be a more 

enduring expression of the FOMC’s policy objectives and how it plans to pursue them.  

The intention is that the public can count on the principles expressed in the statement to 

remain unchanged for some time to come, even as the economic outlook changes.  For 

that reason, the Committee sought the endorsement of all its participants--the Board 

members and all 12 Reserve Bank presidents--not only the voting members.  My 

expectation is that this “consensus statement” will be reaffirmed each January, perhaps 

with minor modifications but with the core principles intact.  

Importantly, the consensus statement provides a numerical value--2 percent--for 

the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal.  But importantly, it pairs that inflation goal 

with a specific goal for maximum employment.  In particular, the statement cites a range 

summarizing FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal rate of 

unemployment.  Finally, the statement says that the Committee will follow a “balanced 

                                                 
11 See, for example, the discussions in Lars E.O. Svensson (1999), “Inflation Targeting as a Monetary 
Policy Rule,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 43 (June), pp. 607-54; and in Jon Faust and Dale W. 
Henderson (2004), “Is Inflation Targeting Best-Practice Monetary Policy?” Federal Reserve Bank of St. 
Louis Review, vol. 86 (July/August), pp 117-44,

approach” as it “seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longer-run goal and 

deviations of employment from the Committee’s assessments of its maximum level.”12  

The specification of 2 percent as the Committee’s longer-run inflation goal, as 

measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures 

(PCE), reflected careful deliberation.  The Committee judged that the PCE price index is 

the most reliable measure of prices that are relevant for households and, in choosing the 

2 percent goal, balanced two main considerations.  First, any rate of price inflation, 

whether positive or negative, imposes some costs on society, making planning more 

difficult and creating distortions in the economy.  Second, were the FOMC to aim for 

zero inflation to eliminate these costs, it would face greater difficulty in providing 

sufficient monetary accommodation in response to large negative shocks.  With inflation 

at zero, the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates implies that real short-term 

interest rates cannot be reduced below zero.  In contrast, with low but positive inflation, 

they can be.13  History has shown that sustained periods of even mild deflation can 

impose immense costs in terms of slow growth and high unemployment.14  Thus, 

balancing the goal of maximum employment against the costs of modest inflation, the 

Committee chose 2 percent measured inflation as the value it judged likely to provide an 

adequate buffer against costly deflations while keeping the costs of inflation quite small.   

Given that the rate of inflation over the longer run is determined solely by 

monetary policy, central banks can, and indeed must, determine the long-run level of 

                                                 
12 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” in note 3. 
13 Due to well-known upward biases in the PCE and other indexes of consumer prices as measures of the 
cost of living, zero inflation, properly measured, corresponds to a positive measured level of PCE inflation, 
most likely on the order of 1/2 percent.   
14 The detrimental effects of unanticipated deflation are discussed in remarks by the then Governor 
Bernanke.  See Ben S. Bernanke (2002), “Deflation:  Making Sure ‘It’ Doesn’t Happen Here,” speech 
delivered at the National Economists Club, Washington, November 21, 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm.

inflation.  In contrast, they cannot do much to affect the maximum sustainable level of 

employment.  That level is determined by factors affecting the structure and dynamics of 

the labor market that are almost completely outside the control of the central bank.  

Nonetheless, the Committee felt strongly that it should provide some quantitative 

interpretation of economic conditions consistent with the maximum employment portion 

of the Fed’s mandate.  Failure to do so might be seen as elevating the inflation side of the 

dual mandate above the employment side.  The Committee chose to couch the longer-run 

employment objective in terms of the rate of unemployment while indicating that other 

indicators may also be relevant in assessing the maximum level of employment.  

Unfortunately, there is a considerable range of disagreement in the economics profession 

and on the FOMC itself about what this longer-run normal rate of unemployment is.  

Moreover, there is widespread recognition that whatever the normal rate might be today, 

it can change over time.  So the consensus statement notes that, as of January 2012, 

FOMC participants’ estimates of this rate had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 

6.0 percent.  I expect the FOMC to review its estimates of the longer-run normal rate of 

unemployment in its annual reaffirmation of the consensus statement on goals and 

strategy.  

Setting Longer-Run Objectives and Minimizing Shorter-Run Fluctuations   

As I mentioned before, stating longer-run goals is only one part of clarifying the 

dual mandate.  The other part involves explaining how the FOMC will conduct policy to 

attain its longer-run objectives over time.  Because shocks to the economy regularly push 

inflation and unemployment away from the Committee’s objectives, the FOMC must 

adjust policy to mitigate such deviations from its goals.  We can therefore think of two 


- 12 - 
 

tasks for monetary policymakers:  first, setting policy to pursue the longer-run objectives; 

and second, adjusting policy in response to shocks to minimize shorter-run fluctuations 

around those objectives. 

Clarity on longer-run goals, due to the important role of expectations, can itself 

help reduce short-run fluctuations.  In the words of the January consensus statement, 

“communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation 

expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term 

interest rates and enhancing the Committee’s ability to promote maximum employment 

in the face of significant economic disturbances.”15   

Put differently, the purpose of providing greater clarity about the FOMC’s longer-

run inflation goal is to anchor inflation expectations more firmly.  These more firmly 

anchored expectations in turn free the Committee’s hand to more actively and effectively 

stabilize short-run fluctuations in economic activity.  The Committee can act in this way 

because the FOMC can tolerate transitory deviations of inflation from its objective in 

order to more forcefully stabilize employment without needing to worry that the public 

will mistake these actions as the pursuit of a higher or lower long-run inflation objective.  

The instability of inflation, inflation expectations, and employment in response to the oil 

price increases of the 1970s vividly illustrates the threat posed by price shocks when 

longer-term inflation expectations are not well anchored. 

To minimize short-run fluctuations, the FOMC also needs to decide how to 

respond to shocks that push the economy away from price stability and maximum 

employment.  The goals of stable prices and maximum employment are often 

                                                 
15 See Board of Governors, “FOMC Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy,” in note 3. 




- 13 - 
 

complementary:  Policymakers need not sacrifice performance on one goal to pursue the 

other.  However, the pursuit of the two sides of the dual mandate can temporarily 

conflict.  For example, returning inflation to its longer-run goal might require, say, a 

tighter stance of monetary policy, whereas returning the economy to maximum 

employment might require just the opposite.  The consensus statement explains that in 

such circumstances the FOMC will pursue a balanced approach, taking into account the 

magnitude of the deviation of each variable from its objective and allowing for the 

possibility that the deviations may not be eliminated over the same time horizon.  The 

balanced-approach strategy endorsed by the FOMC is consistent with the view that 

maximum employment and price stability stand on an equal footing as objectives of 

monetary policy. 

As I see it, such a balanced approach has two important implications that deserve 

emphasis.  The first is that, if the FOMC is doing its best to minimize deviations from its 

objectives, then, over long periods, both unemployment and inflation will be about 

equally likely to fall on either side of those objectives.  To put it simply, if 2 percent 

inflation is the Committee’s goal, 2 percent cannot be viewed as a ceiling for inflation 

because that would result in deviations that are more frequently below 2 percent than 

above and thus not properly balanced with the goal of maximum employment.  Instead, to 

balance the chances that inflation will sometimes deviate a bit above and a bit below the 

goal, 2 percent must be treated as a central tendency around which inflation fluctuates.  

The same holds true for fluctuations of unemployment around its longer-run normal rate. 

 The second property, which to me is the essence of the balanced approach, is that 

reducing the deviation of one variable from its objective must at times involve allowing 


- 14 - 
 

the other variable to move away from its objective.  In particular, reducing inflation may 

sometimes require a monetary tightening that will lead to a temporary rise in 

unemployment.  And a policy that reduces unemployment may, at times, result in 

inflation that could temporarily rise above its target.  

Communicating the Economic Outlook and Its Policy Implications 

How can we translate the principles embodied in the Committee’s consensus 

statement of longer-run goals and strategy into a concrete plan of action for the current 

situation?  And, having done so, how can we make such a plan understandable to the 

public?  I’ll next illustrate a method I use to help me judge the best plan of action at a 

particular time.  I will then describe the communications tools the Committee is now 

using to explain its strategy and discuss others it is considering to better explain its policy 

decisions to the public.  

In addition to clearly specified goals, concrete recommendations about 

appropriate monetary policy require the specification of a baseline outlook for the 

economy and also a realistic, quantitative model of the economy to assess how monetary 

policy choices affect the likely paths of the FOMC’s goal variables--namely, inflation 

and the unemployment rate.  Figure 1 presents such an outlook, one based on a survey of 

the Federal Reserve’s primary dealers conducted during the week prior to the September 

FOMC meeting.  The baseline paths through 2015 of the unemployment rate and inflation 

shown by the solid black lines in the upper two panels track the median of the dealers’ 

forecasts of these variables.  Beyond 2015, the path assumes that the unemployment rate 

converges over time to 6 percent--the median forecast of the long-run unemployment 

rate, which is the upper end of the range of estimates of the longer-run normal 


- 15 - 
 

unemployment rate cited in the FOMC consensus statement--while the inflation rate 

settles down at 2 percent, the FOMC’s inflation objective and the median long-run 

forecast in the dealer survey.  

The solid black line in the bottom panel of the figure shows the median of 

dealers’ expectations for the path of the federal funds rate through the end of 2015.  The 

dealers assumed it would remain near zero through the first half of 2015, consistent with 

the guidance the Committee subsequently provided.  Beyond 2015, the federal funds rate 

is assumed to gradually rise to 4 percent, the long-run value expected by most dealers as 

well as most FOMC participants.  I have assumed in the baseline that this process is 

largely completed within four years.16    

The question I now want to address is whether this illustrative baseline path for 

the federal funds rate is one that reflects a balanced approach to attaining our longer-run 

objectives, consistent with our consensus statement.  As I noted, this balanced approach 

means inflation and unemployment will sometimes temporarily deviate from longer-run 

objectives, but that these deviations would be minimized.  To answer this question I need 

to rely, as I noted, on a specific macroeconomic model, and, for this purpose, I will 

employ the FRB/US model, one of the economic models commonly used at the Board.  

The model lets us analyze every possible policy path to see which one yields the best 

feasible outcome for the paths of unemployment and inflation.  Although the exact 

                                                 
16 It is worth noting that the dealer forecasts probably incorporate some effect from asset purchases that 
were only later announced by the FOMC.  At the time of this survey, the median probability that the 
primary dealers assigned to the FOMC announcing a new program of asset purchases in September was 
55% and the median probability assigned to further asset purchases within one year was 70%.  The median 
value of asset purchases anticipated by the dealers under such a program was about $500 billion.  In the 
simulations that follow, I treat the balance sheet as unchanged relative to its baseline path, and focus on the 
federal funds rate as the tool for conducting monetary policy even though the Committee is currently using 
both forward guidance concerning the funds rate path and the balance sheet to provide monetary 
accommodation.  (The text of this footnote has been revised since its original release.)

numerical results of the exercises I am about to report depend on the specific model, the 

qualitative points that I’ll highlight are fairly general.  

To derive a path for the federal funds rate consistent with the Committee’s 

enunciated longer-run goals and balanced approach, I assume that monetary policy aims 

to minimize the deviations of inflation from 2 percent and the deviations of the 

unemployment rate from 6 percent, with equal weight on both objectives.17  In computing 

the best, or “optimal policy,” path for the federal funds rate to achieve these objectives, I 

will assume that the public fully anticipates that the FOMC will follow this optimal plan 

and is able to assess its effect on the economy.18    

The blue lines with triangles labeled “Optimal policy” show the resulting paths.  

The optimal policy to implement this “balanced approach” to minimizing deviations from 

the inflation and unemployment goals involves keeping the federal funds rate close to 

zero until early 2016, about two quarters longer than in the illustrative baseline, and 

keeping the federal funds rate below the baseline path through 2018.  This highly 

accommodative policy path generates a faster reduction in unemployment than in the 

baseline, while inflation slightly overshoots the Committee’s 2 percent objective for 

several years.   

                                                 
17 More precisely, the loss function that the central bank is assumed to minimize is the discounted sum of 
current and future squared deviations of inflation from 2 percent, current and future squared deviations of 
the unemployment rate from 6 percent, and current and future quarterly changes in the federal funds rate.  
The last term is included to avoid unrealistically large quarterly movements in the “optimal” federal funds 
rate path. 
18 This illustration takes the anticipated scale of asset purchases as fixed.  The effect of these purchases, 
given that the modal expectation in the primary dealer survey was for $500 billion of purchases, is 
implicitly already incorporated into the baseline forecast.  In principle, we could use the FRB/US model to 
perform a joint optimization exercise in which the optimal paths of asset purchases and the federal funds 
rate are simultaneously determined, but the results from such an exercise would be highly sensitive to 
assumptions about possible costs of asset purchases that are not well defined, such as the potential for 
market disruption.

This path illustrates one of the key features of optimal policy under a balanced 

approach to the dual mandate.  Provided that long-term inflation expectations are firmly 

anchored, the federal funds rate is set to balance the benefits from a faster reduction of 

the unemployment rate against the losses from a temporary and modest increase of 

inflation above 2 percent.  The more rapid reduction in unemployment along the optimal 

control path than in the baseline reflects the stimulus to demand provided by lower 

nominal and real interest rates, higher asset prices, and the expectation of more rapid 

growth in employment and income.19   

The computation of an optimal path for monetary policy is obviously 

complicated, and, as I’ll discuss, it’s challenging to communicate.  It rests on many 

assumptions about the outlook for the economy and its structure.  An alternative and 

much simpler approach would entail setting the federal funds rate according to the 

prescriptions of a policy rule, such as the well-known Taylor rule or a variant.  Many 

studies have shown that, in normal times, when the economy is buffeted by typical 

shocks--not the extraordinary shock resulting from the financial crisis--simple rules can 

come pretty close to approximating optimal policies.  In fact, empirical research suggests 

that a modified version of the original Taylor rule fits the behavior of the Fed reasonably 

well from the late 1980s until the financial crisis.  Given that participants in financial 

markets are familiar with both the FOMC’s historical behavior and simple rules, the 

communications challenges might arguably be less severe if the FOMC followed such a 

                                                 
19 It is also worth noting that the “Exit Strategy Principles” adopted by the FOMC in June 2011 indicate 
that the Committee intends to gradually sell off agency securities to normalize the size and composition of 
its portfolio after liftoff of the federal funds rate.  This assumption pertaining to asset sales is incorporated 
into the FRB/US simulations, and provides a further reason why, along the optimal control path, the federal 
funds rate stays low for so long, rising only gradually after liftoff.

strategy.20  To be sure, I would never advocate turning over monetary policy to a 

computer, but why shouldn’t the FOMC adopt such a rule as a guidepost to policy? 

The answer is that times are by no means normal now, and the simple rules that 

perform well under ordinary circumstances just won’t perform well with persistently 

strong headwinds restraining recovery and with the federal funds rate constrained by the 

zero bound.  A further simulation serves to illustrate that such rules would perform 

relatively poorly at the current time.  The red lines with squares labeled “Modified Taylor 

rule” show the economic outcomes that would be expected if the federal funds rate were 

set according to the prescriptions of a rule that is similar to the original Taylor rule, with 

the only difference being that it responds equally to deviations of unemployment and 

inflation from their respective longer-run values.   

 The figure shows that this rule would raise the federal funds rate substantially 

earlier than the optimal path and thereby leads to more protracted deviations of the 

unemployment rate above its longer-run normal level without any measurable gains in 

keeping inflation closer to the 2 percent target.  In contrast, the optimal policy results in 

better economic outcomes.  In effect, it compensates for the period of economic 

weakness induced by both the zero lower bound and the unusual persistence and severity 

of the headwinds now buffeting the economy by holding the federal funds rate lower for 

                                                 
20 The rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt - 2) + 1.0Yt.  In this expression, R is the federal funds rate, π is 
the percent change in the headline PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and Y is the output gap.  The 
output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.0(6-Ut), where 2.0 is the estimated value 
of the Okun’s law coefficient and 6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating inflation rate of 
unemployment, or NAIRU.  In a recent speech (see Janet L. Yellen (2012), “The Economic Outlook and 
Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Money Marketeers of New York University, New York, 
April 11, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120411a.htm), I dubbed this rule “Taylor 
(1999),” as John Taylor described the rule in a paper published that year.  See John B. Taylor (1999), “A 
Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy Rules,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:  
University of Chicago Press), pp. 319-41.  As Taylor’s own strong preference is for his original rule--
Taylor (1993)--I now refer to the later rule as the “modified Taylor rule.”  (The text of this footnote has 
been revised since its original release.)

longer than the modified Taylor rule, thereby maintaining greater accommodation as the 

economic recovery takes hold.21  

The Future of FOMC Communications 

The fact that simple rules aren’t as useful in current circumstances as they would 

be for the FOMC at other times poses a significant challenge for FOMC communications, 

especially since private-sector Fed watchers have frequently relied on such rules to 

understand and predict the Committee’s decisions on the federal funds rate.22  In 

particular, private-sector forecasters commonly use such rules to revise their expectations 

concerning the path of the federal funds rate in response to news that alters their views 

concerning the outlook for the economy.   

Now, however, the federal funds rate may well diverge for a number of years 

from the prescriptions of simple rules.  Moreover, the FOMC announced an open-ended 

asset purchase program in September, and there is no historical record for the public to 

use in forming expectations on how the FOMC is likely to use this tool.  Thus, the current 

situation makes it very important that the FOMC provide private-sector forecasters with 

the information they need to predict how the likely path of policy will change in response 

to changes in the outlook.  While a clear statement of the Committee’s goals and the 

strategy it will use to achieve them was an important and necessary step in this regard, 

the exercise we’ve just undertaken illustrates that a host of additional assumptions and 

                                                 
21 I would note that the original Taylor rule, which places only one-half as much weight as the modified 
rule on unemployment deviations, would already have raised the federal funds rate above the zero bound, 
producing far worse outcomes than any illustrated in figure 1. 
22 The baseline path, based through the end of 2015 on the primary dealer survey, assumes greater 
accommodation than would be consistent with the modified Taylor rule, suggesting that FOMC 
communications have had some success in conveying the desirability of such an approach.

information is needed to derive the concrete implications of the consensus statement for 

the FOMC’s policy decisions.   

The challenge facing the FOMC now is to devise ways to communicate its policy 

intentions during a period in which policy will most likely be constrained by the zero 

bound on short-term rates and asset purchases will be actively used to foster faster 

growth.  I think the existing FOMC postmeeting statement already goes some way in this 

direction.  With respect to the path of the federal funds rate, it offers a date--mid-2015--as 

the earliest time at which the Committee currently anticipates that liftoff might be 

warranted.  As the simulations illustrate, this date is later than the modified Taylor rule 

would predict and closer to the predictions of the optimal policy simulation.  This later 

liftoff date is consistent with the Committee’s statement that “a highly accommodative 

stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the 

economic recovery strengthens.”23  Moreover, the simulations also suggest that, once 

liftoff from the zero lower bound occurs, it would be optimal for the federal funds rate to 

remain for some time below the prescriptions from a rule, such as the modified Taylor 

rule, that might in the past have provided a good guide to the Committee’s action.  

Finally, with respect to asset purchases, the guidance indicates that, subject to ongoing 

evaluations of their efficacy and costs, purchases will continue until there is a substantial 

improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability.  

Importantly, this open-ended plan reflects a goal-oriented approach in which the ultimate 

quantity of asset purchases will be geared to the attainment of sufficient progress toward 

the Committee’s employment goal.

Could the FOMC go further in enhancing its communications?  One logical 

possibility would be for the Committee to publish forecasts akin to those I’ve presented 

in figure 1.  That is, the Committee could provide the public with its projections for 

inflation and the unemployment rate together with what it views as appropriate paths both 

for the federal funds rate and its asset holdings, conditional on its current outlook for the 

economy.  Over time, these projections would be revised in response to incoming data 

that alters the Committee’s economic outlook or, instead, because the Committee decides 

to alter its policy stance.  Several inflation-targeting central banks, such as those in 

Sweden and Norway, publish forecasts of this type.  Such a forecast could be highly 

informative, and, in recent months, the FOMC has explored whether it might be 

achievable.  Not surprisingly perhaps, in a Committee of 19 participants with diverse 

views on the structure of the economy and appropriate policy, a detailed consensus 

forecast is exceptionally difficult to develop.  As an alternative, the FOMC could try to 

build on the individual projections of macroeconomic variables and policy already 

included in its quarterly SEP to provide at least some further information about how these 

individual projections inform the Committee’s collective policy judgment.  

Improvements along these lines are currently under active consideration.24 

                                                 
24 In the SEP, participants provide paths for the unemployment rate, real GDP growth, and inflation that 
each expects under his or her own view of the policy that is most appropriate to achieve the Committee’s 
dual mandate.  But as is apparent in the SEP, participants have a great diversity of views on matters such as 
the expected timing and subsequent pace of federal funds rate increases.  The SEP currently provides 
information about the separate distributions of the projections for inflation, real activity, and the federal 
funds rate over the next few years, but it does not provide the joint paths--that is, multivariate projections.  
The public cannot, for example, infer whether a projection for higher inflation in 2015 was made by a 
participant who expects real activity to be weak due to a more pessimistic view about the productive 
capacity of the economy, or by a participant who expects higher inflation in the context of a stronger 
recovery, perhaps judging, in the spirit of the optimal policy simulations, that somewhat higher inflation is 
warranted for some time to achieve faster progress in reducing unemployment. 


- 22 - 
 

Another alternative that deserves serious consideration would be for the 

Committee to provide an explanation of how the calendar date guidance included in the 

statement--currently mid-2015--relates to the outlook for the economy, which can and 

surely will change over time.  Going further, the Committee might eliminate the calendar 

date entirely and replace it with guidance on the economic conditions that would need to 

prevail before liftoff of the federal funds rate might be judged appropriate.  Several of my 

FOMC colleagues have advocated such an approach, and I am also strongly supportive.  

The idea is to define a zone of combinations of the unemployment rate and inflation 

within which the FOMC would continue to hold the federal funds rate in its current, near-

zero range.  For example, Charles Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, suggests that the 

FOMC should commit to hold the federal funds rate in its current low range at least until 

unemployment has declined below 7 percent, provided that inflation over the medium 

term remains below 3 percent.  Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Minneapolis 

Fed, suggests thresholds of 5.5 percent for unemployment and 2.25 percent for the 

medium-term inflation outlook.  Under such an approach, liftoff would not be automatic 

once a threshold is reached; that decision would require further Committee deliberation 

and judgment.   

I support this approach because it would enable the public to immediately adjust 

its expectations concerning the timing of liftoff in response to new information affecting 

the economic outlook.  This market response would serve as a kind of automatic 

stabilizer for the economy:  Information suggesting a weaker outlook would 

automatically induce market participants to push out the anticipated date of tightening 

and vice versa.   


- 23 - 
 

Perhaps more importantly, the use of inflation and unemployment thresholds 

would help the public understand whether a shift in the calendar date, assuming that one 

is still included in the statement, reflects a change in the Committee’s economic outlook 

or, alternatively, a change in its view concerning the appropriate degree of 

accommodation.  Since monetary policy works in large part through the public’s 

perceptions of the FOMC’s systematic behavior, this distinction is critical.25 

Conclusion 

 The past few years have seen important changes in the FOMC’s 

communications--innovations that promote the Federal Reserve’s accountability to the 

public.  Beyond that, I believe better communication serves to improve the efficacy of 

monetary policy at a time when the FOMC faces constraints on its ability to provide 

appropriate support to the economic recovery through the federal funds rate, its 

traditional policy tool.  In my view, we’ve made progress, but much work remains to be 

done. 

                                                 
25 The FOMC could also, potentially, provide additional information pertaining to the economic conditions 
it would expect to justify a decision to stop, or scale back, its asset purchases.  However, this decision also 
depends on the Committee’s assessment of efficacy and costs--matters on which the Committee is still 
gaining experience.
