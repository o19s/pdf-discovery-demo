Labor Market Dynamics and Monetary Policy 




Remarks by 


Janet L. Yellen 


Chair 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium 


Jackson Hole, Wyoming 








August 22, 2014 





In the five years since the end of the Great Recession, the economy has made 

considerable progress in recovering from the largest and most sustained loss of 

employment in the United States since the Great Depression.1  More jobs have now been 

created in the recovery than were lost in the downturn, with payroll employment in May 

of this year finally exceeding the previous peak in January 2008.  Job gains in 2014 have 

averaged 230,000 a month, up from the 190,000 a month pace during the preceding two 

years.  The unemployment rate, at 6.2 percent in July, has declined nearly 4 percentage 

points from its late 2009 peak.  Over the past year, the unemployment rate has fallen 

considerably, and at a surprisingly rapid pace.  These developments are encouraging, but 

it speaks to the depth of the damage that, five years after the end of the recession, the 

labor market has yet to fully recover.   

The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy objective is to foster maximum 

employment and price stability.  In this regard, a key challenge is to assess just how far 

the economy now stands from the attainment of its maximum employment goal.  

Judgments concerning the size of that gap are complicated by ongoing shifts in the 

structure of the labor market and the possibility that the severe recession caused 

persistent changes in the labor market’s functioning.     

These and other questions about the labor market are central to the conduct of 

monetary policy, so I am pleased that the organizers of this year’s symposium chose 

labor market dynamics as its theme.  My colleagues on the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) and I look to the presentations and discussions over the next two 

days for insights into possible changes that are affecting the labor market.  I expect, 

                                                 
1 Nonfarm employment contracted by 6.3 percent from its peak in 2008 to its trough in early 2010, 

compared with a 5.2 percent loss in the 1948-49 recession, previously the largest since the 1930s.

however, that our understanding of labor market developments and their potential 

implications for inflation will remain far from perfect.  As a consequence, monetary 

policy ultimately must be conducted in a pragmatic manner that relies not on any 

particular indicator or model, but instead reflects an ongoing assessment of a wide range 

of information in the context of our ever-evolving understanding of the economy.  

The Labor Market Recovery and Monetary Policy 

In my remarks this morning, I will review a number of developments related to 

the functioning of the labor market that have made it more difficult to judge the 

remaining degree of slack.  Differing interpretations of these developments affect 

judgments concerning the appropriate path of monetary policy.  Before turning to the 

specifics, however, I would like to provide some context concerning the role of the labor 

market in shaping monetary policy over the past several years.  During that time, the 

FOMC has maintained a highly accommodative monetary policy in pursuit of its 

congressionally mandated goals of maximum employment and stable prices.  The 

Committee judged such a stance appropriate because inflation has fallen short of our 

2 percent objective while the labor market, until recently, operated very far from any 

reasonable definition of maximum employment.   

The FOMC’s current program of asset purchases began when the unemployment 

rate stood at 8.1 percent and progress in lowering it was expected to be much slower than 

desired.  The Committee’s objective was to achieve a substantial improvement in the 

outlook for the labor market, and as progress toward this goal has materialized, we have 

reduced our pace of asset purchases and expect to complete this program in October.  In 

addition, in December 2012, the Committee modified its forward guidance for the federal

funds rate, stating that “as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6-1/2 percent, 

inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half 

percentage point above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term 

inflation expectations continue to be well anchored,” the Committee would not even 

consider raising the federal funds rate above the 0 to 1/4 percent range.2  This “threshold 

based” forward guidance was deemed appropriate under conditions in which inflation 

was subdued and the economy remained unambiguously far from maximum employment.   

Earlier this year, however, with the unemployment rate declining faster than had 

been anticipated and nearing the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the FOMC recast its forward 

guidance, stating that “in determining how long to maintain the current 0 to 1/4 percent 

target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee would assess progress--both 

realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 

inflation.”3  As the recovery progresses, assessments of the degree of remaining slack in 

the labor market need to become more nuanced because of considerable uncertainty about 

the level of employment consistent with the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate.  Indeed, in 

its 2012 statement on longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy, the FOMC 

explicitly recognized that factors determining maximum employment “may change over 

time and may not be directly measurable,” and that assessments of the level of maximum 

employment “are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.”4  Accordingly, the

reformulated forward guidance reaffirms the FOMC’s view that policy decisions will not 

be based on any single indicator, but will instead take into account a wide range of 

information on the labor market, as well as inflation and financial developments.5 

Interpreting Labor Market Surprises:  Past and Future 

The assessment of labor market slack is rarely simple and has been especially 

challenging recently.  Estimates of slack necessitate difficult judgments about the 

magnitudes of the cyclical and structural influences affecting labor market variables, 

including labor force participation, the extent of part-time employment for economic 

reasons, and labor market flows, such as the pace of hires and quits.  A considerable body 

of research suggests that the behavior of these and other labor market variables has 

changed since the Great Recession.6  Along with cyclical influences, significant structural 

factors have affected the labor market, including the aging of the workforce and other 

demographic trends, possible changes in the underlying degree of dynamism in the labor 

market, and the phenomenon of “polarization”--that is, the reduction in the relative 

number of middle-skill jobs.7   

                                                 
5 The central role of labor market conditions in monetary policy deliberations has also been apparent 

abroad.  Last year the Bank of England announced its intention not to raise its policy rate at least until the 

unemployment rate reached 7 percent, subject to conditions on inflation and financial stability.  Since that 
time, the unemployment rate in the United Kingdom has dropped unexpectedly rapidly, prompting 

policymakers to consider data beyond this single indicator when assessing the extent of spare capacity in 

the U.K. economy.  As in the United States, an unexpectedly swift decline in unemployment has raised 

questions about the structural and cyclical effects of a severe recession. 
6 For a discussion of important differences in the evolution of labor market conditions during the Great 

Recession relative to typical postwar patterns, see Henry S. Farber (2011), “Job Loss in the Great 

Recession:  Historical Perspective from the Displaced Workers Survey, 1984-2010,” NBER Working Paper 

Series 17040 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, May). 
7 For convenience, the analysis here is presented as if cyclical factors and structural factors can be neatly 

delineated.  In reality, the line between the two may be indistinct.  Moreover, what begins as cyclical 

weakness may evolve into structural damage.  For a discussion of the strategic issues that arise when 

policymakers believe such evolution from cyclical to structural to be an important feature of the economy, 

see Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2013), “Aggregate Supply in the United 

States:  Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” Finance and 

Economics Discussion Series 2013-77 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 

November), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201377/201377abs.html.

Consider first the behavior of the labor force participation rate, which has 

declined substantially since the end of the recession even as the unemployment rate has 

fallen.  As a consequence, the employment-to-population ratio has increased far less over 

the past several years than the unemployment rate alone would indicate, based on past 

experience.  For policymakers, the key question is: What portion of the decline in labor 

force participation reflects structural shifts and what portion reflects cyclical weakness in 

the labor market?  If the cyclical component is abnormally large, relative to the 

unemployment rate, then it might be seen as an additional contributor to labor market 

slack.    

Labor force participation peaked in early 2000, so its decline began well before 

the Great Recession.  A portion of that decline clearly relates to the aging of the baby 

boom generation.  But the pace of decline accelerated with the recession.  As an 

accounting matter, the drop in the participation rate since 2008 can be attributed to 

increases in four factors:  retirement, disability, school enrollment, and other reasons, 

including worker discouragement.8  Of these, greater worker discouragement is most 

directly the result of a weak labor market, so we could reasonably expect further 

increases in labor demand to pull a sizable share of discouraged workers back into the 

workforce.  Indeed, the flattening out of the labor force participation rate since late last 

year could partly reflect discouraged workers rejoining the labor force in response to the 

significant improvements that we have seen in labor market conditions.  If so, the cyclical 

shortfall in labor force participation may have diminished.

the-labor-force-participation-rate.pdf.

What is more difficult to determine is whether some portion of the increase in 

disability rates, retirements, and school enrollments since the Great Recession reflects 

cyclical forces.  While structural factors have clearly and importantly affected each of 

these three trends, some portion of the decline in labor force participation resulting from 

these trends could be related to the recession and slow recovery and therefore might 

reverse in a stronger labor market.9  Disability applications and educational enrollments 

typically are affected by cyclical factors, and existing evidence suggests that the elevated 

levels of both may partly reflect perceptions of poor job prospects.10  Moreover, the rapid 

pace of retirements over the past few years might reflect some degree of pull-forward of 

future retirements in the face of a weak labor market.  If so, retirements might contribute

less to declining participation in the period ahead than would otherwise be expected 

based on the aging workforce.11     

A second factor bearing on estimates of labor market slack is the elevated number 

of workers who are employed part time but desire full-time work (those classified as 

“part time for economic reasons”).  At nearly 5 percent of the labor force, the number of 

such workers is notably larger, relative to the unemployment rate, than has been typical 

historically, providing another reason why the current level of the unemployment rate 

may understate the amount of remaining slack in the labor market.  Again, however, 

some portion of the rise in involuntary part-time work may reflect structural rather than 

cyclical factors.  For example, the ongoing shift in employment away from goods 

production and toward services, a sector which historically has used a greater portion of 

part-time workers, may be boosting the share of part-time jobs.  Likewise, the continuing 

decline of middle-skill jobs, some of which could be replaced by part-time jobs, may 

raise the share of part-time jobs in overall employment.12  Despite these challenges in 

assessing where the share of those employed part time for economic reasons may settle in 

                                                 
11 The effects of the Great Recession on retirements are difficult to identify.  During the recession and 

immediately after, the losses in wealth may have put upward pressure on labor force participation; the 

persistently weak labor market may have subsequently contributed to more retirements and thus put 

downward pressure on participation.  Perhaps as a result of these confounding forces, early research on the 

effects of the Great Recession on retirement finds unclear results.  For example, see Alan L. Gustman, 

Thomas L. Steinmeier, and Nahid Tabatabai (2011), “How Did the Recession of 2007-2009 Affect the 

Wealth and Retirement of the Near Retirement Age Population in the Health and Retirement Study?”

the long run, the sharp run-up in involuntary part-time employment during the recession 

and its slow decline thereafter suggest that cyclical factors are significant.    

Private sector labor market flows provide additional indications of the strength of 

the labor market.  For example, the quits rate has tended to be pro-cyclical, since more 

workers voluntarily quit their jobs when they are more confident about their ability to 

find new ones and when firms are competing more actively for new hires.  Indeed, the 

quits rate has picked up with improvements in the labor market over the past year, but it 

still remains somewhat depressed relative to its level before the recession.  A significant 

increase in job openings over the past year suggests notable improvement in labor market 

conditions, but the hiring rate has only partially recovered from its decline during the 

recession.  Given the rise in job vacancies, hiring may be poised to pick up, but the 

failure of hiring to rise with vacancies could also indicate that firms perceive the 

prospects for economic growth as still insufficient to justify adding to payrolls.  

Alternatively, subdued hiring could indicate that firms are encountering difficulties in 

finding qualified job applicants.  As is true of the other indicators I have discussed, labor 

market flows tend to reflect not only cyclical but also structural changes in the economy.  

Indeed, these flows may provide evidence of reduced labor market dynamism, which 

could prove quite persistent.13  That said, the balance of evidence leads me to conclude 

                                                 
13 For an analysis documenting declines in the rates of hiring, layoffs, and quits, along with lower job 

creation and destruction, see Steven J. Davis, R. Jason Faberman, and John Haltiwanger (2012), “Labor 

Market Flows in the Cross Section and over Time,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 59 (January), 

pp. 1-18.  For a review of a range of evidence and possible explanations, see Henry R. Hyatt and James R. 

Spletzer (2013), “The Recent Decline in Employment Dynamics,” IZA Discussion Paper Series 7231 

(Bonn, Germany:  Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA), February), http://ftp.iza.org/dp7231.pdf.  These 

authors suggest that much additional work is needed to understand the role of different factors in changes in 

labor market dynamism.  For an analysis that raises the possibility that some of these shifts reflect better 

job matches, see Raven Molloy, Christopher L. Smith, and Abigail K. Wozniak (2014), “Declining 

Migration within the U.S.:  The Role of the Labor Market,” NBER Working Paper Series 20065 

(Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, April).

that weak aggregate demand has contributed significantly to the depressed levels of quits 

and hires during the recession and in the recovery.   

One convenient way to summarize the information contained in a large number of 

indicators is through the use of so-called factor models.  Following this methodology, 

Federal Reserve Board staff developed a labor market conditions index from 19 labor 

market indicators, including four I just discussed.14  This broadly based metric supports 

the conclusion that the labor market has improved significantly over the past year, but it 

also suggests that the decline in the unemployment rate over this period somewhat 

overstates the improvement in overall labor market conditions.   

Finally, changes in labor compensation may also help shed light on the degree of 

labor market slack, although here, too, there are significant challenges in distinguishing 

between cyclical and structural influences.  Over the past several years, wage inflation, as 

measured by several different indexes, has averaged about 2 percent, and there has been 

little evidence of any broad-based acceleration in either wages or compensation.  Indeed, 

in real terms, wages have been about flat, growing less than labor productivity.  This 

pattern of subdued real wage gains suggests that nominal compensation could rise more 

quickly without exerting any meaningful upward pressure on inflation.  And, since wage 

movements have historically been sensitive to tightness in the labor market, the recent 

                                                 
14 Among the indicators in the “labor market conditions index” are the labor force participation rate, 

workers classified as part time for economic reasons, hires, and quits.  The index does not include the 

JOLTS job openings series but instead uses the Board staff’s composite help-wanted index, which has a 

longer history; the two measures generally track each other closely.  See Hess Chung, Bruce Fallick, 

Christopher Nekarda, and David Ratner (2014), “Assessing the Change in Labor Market Conditions,” 

FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, May 22), 

www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/notes/feds-notes/2014/assessing-the-change-in-labor-market-

conditions-20140522.html.  For a closely related index of labor market conditions, see Craig S. Hakkio and 

Jonathan L. Willis (2013), “Assessing Labor Market Conditions:  The Level of Activity and the Speed of 

Improvement,” Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Macro Bulletin, July 18,

behavior of both nominal and real wages point to weaker labor market conditions than 

would be indicated by the current unemployment rate.   

There are three reasons, however, why we should be cautious in drawing such a 

conclusion.  First, the sluggish pace of nominal and real wage growth in recent years may 

reflect the phenomenon of “pent-up wage deflation.”15  The evidence suggests that many 

firms faced significant constraints in lowering compensation during the recession and the 

earlier part of the recovery because of “downward nominal wage rigidity”--namely, an 

inability or unwillingness on the part of firms to cut nominal wages.  To the extent that 

firms faced limits in reducing real and nominal wages when the labor market was 

exceptionally weak, they may find that now they do not need to raise wages to attract 

qualified workers.  As a result, wages might rise relatively slowly as the labor market 

strengthens.  If pent-up wage deflation is holding down wage growth, the current very 

moderate wage growth could be a misleading signal of the degree of remaining slack.  

Further, wages could begin to rise at a noticeably more rapid pace once pent-up wage 

deflation has been absorbed.  

Second, wage developments reflect not only cyclical but also secular trends that 

have likely affected the evolution of labor’s share of income in recent years.  As I noted, 

real wages have been rising less rapidly than productivity, implying that real unit labor 

costs have been declining, a pattern suggesting that there is scope for nominal wages to 

accelerate from their recent pace without creating meaningful inflationary pressure.  

However, research suggests that the decline in real unit labor costs may partly reflect

secular factors that predate the recession, including changing patterns of production and 

international trade, as well as measurement issues.16  If so, productivity growth could 

continue to outpace real wage gains even when the economy is again operating at its 

potential. 

A third issue that complicates the interpretation of wage trends is the possibility 

that, because of the dislocations of the Great Recession, transitory wage and price 

pressures could emerge well before maximum sustainable employment has been reached, 

although they would abate over time as the economy moves back toward maximum 

employment.17  The argument is that workers who have suffered long-term 

unemployment--along with, perhaps, those who have dropped out of the labor force but 

would return to work in a stronger economy--face significant impediments to 

reemployment.  In this case, further improvement in the labor market could entail 

stronger wage pressures for a time before maximum employment has been attained.18

Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, September), www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp2013-

empirical literature on the New-Keynesian Phillips Curve (for example, see Jordi Galí and Mark Gertler 

(1999), “Inflation Dynamics:  A Structural Econometric Analysis,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 

44 (October), pp. 195-222), and the connections (or lack thereof) between the labor share and traditional 

measures of slack (in the statistical sense) were highlighted in, among others, Michael T. Kiley (2007), “A 

Quantitative Comparison of Sticky-Price and Sticky-Information Models of Price Setting,” Journal of 

Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 39 (February), pp. 101-25; and Michael T. Kiley (2013), “Output Gaps,” 

Journal of Macroeconomics, vol. 37 (September), pp. 1-18.  Moreover, recent research has highlighted the 

challenges that swings in the labor share have presented for the interpretation of inflation developments (for 

example, Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2014), “Inflation in the Great 

Recession and New Keynesian Models,” NBER Working Paper Series 20055 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National

Implications of Labor Market Developments for Monetary Policy 

The focus of my remarks to this point has been on the functioning of the labor 

market and how cyclical and structural influences have complicated the task of 

determining the state of the economy relative to the FOMC’s objective of maximum 

employment.  In my remaining time, I will turn to the special challenges that these 

difficulties in assessing the labor market pose for evaluating the appropriate stance of 

monetary policy.   

Any discussion of appropriate monetary policy must be framed by the Federal 

Reserve’s dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.  For much 

of the past five years, the FOMC has been confronted with an obvious and substantial 

degree of slack in the labor market and significant risks of slipping into persistent below-

target inflation.  In such circumstances, the need for extraordinary accommodation is 

unambiguous, in my view. 

However, with the economy getting closer to our objectives, the FOMC’s 

emphasis is naturally shifting to questions about the degree of remaining slack, how

     The interaction of labor force participation and inflationary pressures has been understudied, in part 

because the strong trends in participation due to demographic factors have implied that it is difficult to 

identify the cyclical component.  For an important example of a study demonstrating, within the core 

macroeconomic framework widely used in research, that movements in participation should be considered 

in models of wage and price determination, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor 

Force Participation and Monetary Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” IMF Working Paper

quickly that slack is likely to be taken up, and thereby to the question of under what 

conditions we should begin dialing back our extraordinary accommodation.  As should be 

evident from my remarks so far, I believe that our assessments of the degree of slack 

must be based on a wide range of variables and will require difficult judgments about the 

cyclical and structural influences in the labor market.  While these assessments have 

always been imprecise and subject to revision, the task has become especially 

challenging in the aftermath of the Great Recession, which brought nearly unprecedented 

cyclical dislocations and may have been associated with similarly unprecedented 

structural changes in the labor market--changes that have yet to be fully understood.   

So, what is a monetary policymaker to do?  Some have argued that, in light of the 

uncertainties associated with estimating labor market slack, policymakers should focus 

mainly on inflation developments in determining appropriate policy.  To take an extreme 

case, if labor market slack was the dominant and predictable driver of inflation, we could 

largely ignore labor market indicators and look instead at the behavior of inflation to 

determine the extent of slack in the labor market.  In present circumstances, with inflation 

still running below the FOMC’s 2 percent objective, such an approach would suggest that 

we could maintain policy accommodation until inflation is clearly moving back toward 2 

percent, at which point we could also be confident that slack had diminished.   

Of course, our task is not nearly so straightforward.  Historically, slack has 

accounted for only a small portion of the fluctuations in inflation.  Indeed, unusual 

aspects of the current recovery may have shifted the lead-lag relationship between a 

tightening labor market and rising inflation pressures in either direction.  For example, as 

I discussed earlier, if downward nominal wage rigidities created a stock of pent-up wage

deflation during the economic downturn, observed wage and price pressures associated 

with a given amount of slack or pace of reduction in slack might be unusually low for a 

time.  If so, the first clear signs of inflation pressure could come later than usual in the 

progression toward maximum employment.  As a result, maintaining a high degree of 

monetary policy accommodation until inflation pressures emerge could, in this case, 

unduly delay the removal of accommodation, necessitating an abrupt and potentially 

disruptive tightening of policy later on.   

Conversely, profound dislocations in the labor market in recent years--such as 

depressed participation associated with worker discouragement and a still-substantial 

level of long-term unemployment--may cause inflation pressures to arise earlier than 

usual as the degree of slack in the labor market declines.  However, some of the resulting 

wage and price pressures could subsequently ease as higher real wages draw workers 

back into the labor force and lower long-term unemployment.19  As a consequence, 

tightening monetary policy as soon as inflation moves back toward 2 percent might, in 

this case, prevent labor markets from recovering fully and so would not be consistent 

with the dual mandate. 

Inferring the degree of resource utilization from real-time readings on inflation is 

further complicated by the familiar challenge of distinguishing transitory price changes 

from persistent price pressures.  Indeed, the recent firming of inflation toward our 

2 percent goal appears to reflect a combination of both factors.          

These complexities in evaluating the relationship between slack and inflation 

pressures in the current recovery are illustrative of a host of issues that the FOMC will be

grappling with as the recovery continues.  There is no simple recipe for appropriate 

policy in this context, and the FOMC is particularly attentive to the need to clearly 

describe the policy framework we are using to meet these challenges.  As the FOMC has 

noted in its recent policy statements, the stance of policy will be guided by our 

assessments of how far we are from our objectives of maximum employment and 

2 percent inflation as well as our assessment of the likely pace of progress toward those 

objectives.   

At the FOMC’s most recent meeting, the Committee judged, based on a range of 

labor market indicators, that “labor market conditions improved.”20  Indeed, as I noted 

earlier, they have improved more rapidly than the Committee had anticipated.  

Nevertheless, the Committee judged that underutilization of labor resources still remains 

significant.  Given this assessment and the Committee’s expectation that inflation will 

gradually move up toward its longer-run objective, the Committee reaffirmed its view 

“that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds 

rate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends, especially if 

projected inflation continues to run below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and 

provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.”21  But if progress 

in the labor market continues to be more rapid than anticipated by the Committee or if 

inflation moves up more rapidly than anticipated, resulting in faster convergence toward 

our dual objectives, then increases in the federal funds rate target could come sooner than 

the Committee currently expects and could be more rapid thereafter.  Of course, if

economic performance turns out to be disappointing and progress toward our goals 

proceeds more slowly than we expect, then the future path of interest rates likely would 

be more accommodative than we currently anticipate.  As I have noted many times, 

monetary policy is not on a preset path.  The Committee will be closely monitoring 

incoming information on the labor market and inflation in determining the appropriate 

stance of monetary policy.  

Overall, I suspect that many of the labor market issues you will be discussing at 

this conference will be at the center of FOMC discussions for some time to come.  I thank 

you in advance for the insights you will offer and encourage you to continue the 

important research that advances our understanding of cyclical and structural labor 

market issues.
