I am here today to talk about what the Federal Reserve is doing to help our nation 

recover from the financial crisis and the Great Recession, the effects of which were 

particularly severe for the people and the communities you serve.  

Part of that effort has involved strengthening the financial system.  New rules are 

in place to better protect consumers and ensure that credit is available to help 

communities grow.  The Federal Reserve also plays a role in communities by fostering 

dialogue that promotes community development.  I will highlight some initiatives around 

the Federal Reserve System that I believe are making a real difference.  Later today, I 

will visit the Manufacturing Technology Program at Daley College, on Chicago’s south 

side, where adult students are acquiring the skills they need to connect to good-paying 

jobs in that sector. 

The Fed supports the work you do in communities because you make a difference.  

You help ensure that credit is available for families to buy homes and for small 

businesses to expand.  Your organizations sponsor programs that help make communities 

safer and families healthier and more financially secure.  One of the most important 

things you do is to help people meet the demands of finding a job in what remains a 

challenging economy.  And that help is crucial, but I also believe it can’t succeed without 

two other things. 

The first of these is the courage and determination of the people you serve.  The 

past six years have been difficult for many Americans, but the hardships faced by some 

have shattered lives and families.  Too many people know firsthand how devastating it is 

to lose a job at which you had succeeded and be unable to find another; to run through 

your savings and even lose your home, as months and sometimes years pass trying to find 


 - 2 - 

work; to feel your marriage and other relationships strained and broken by financial 

difficulties.  And yet many of those who have suffered the most find the will to keep 

trying.  I will introduce you to three of these brave men and women, your neighbors here 

in the great city of Chicago.  These individuals have benefited from just the kind of help 

from community groups that I highlighted a moment ago, and they recently shared their 

personal stories with me. 

It might seem obvious, but the second thing that is needed to help people find 

jobs…is jobs.  No amount of training will be enough if there are not enough jobs to fill.  I 

have mentioned some of the things the Fed does to help communities, but the most 

important thing we do is to use monetary policy to promote a stronger economy.  The 

Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps since the onset of the financial crisis to 

spur economic activity and create jobs, and I will explain why I believe those efforts are 

still needed.   

The Fed provides this help by influencing interest rates.  Although we work 

through financial markets, our goal is to help Main Street, not Wall Street.  By keeping 

interest rates low, we are trying to make homes more affordable and revive the housing 

market.  We are trying to make it cheaper for businesses to build, expand, and hire.  We 

are trying to lower the costs of buying a car that can carry a worker to a new job and kids 

to school, and our policies are also spurring the revival of the auto industry.  We are 

trying to help families afford things they need so that greater spending can drive job 

creation and even more spending, thereby strengthening the recovery.   


 - 3 - 

When the Federal Reserve’s policies are effective, they improve the welfare of 

everyone who benefits from a stronger economy, most of all those who have been hit 

hardest by the recession and the slow recovery.   

Now let me offer my view of the state of the recovery, with particular attention to 

the labor market and conditions faced by workers.  Nationwide, and in Chicago, the 

economy and the labor market have strengthened considerably from the depths of the 

Great Recession.  Since the unemployment rate peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, the 

economy has added more than 7-1/2 million jobs and the unemployment rate has fallen 

more than 3 percentage points to 6.7 percent.  That progress has been gradual but 

remarkably steady--February was the 41st consecutive month of payroll growth, one of 

the longest stretches ever.   

Chicago, as you all know, was hit harder than many areas during the recession 

and remains a tougher market for workers.  But there has been considerable improvement 

here also.  Unemployment in the city of Chicago is down from a peak of nearly 13 

percent to about 9-1/2 percent at last count.  That is about the same improvement as in the 

larger Chicago metro area, where unemployment has fallen to 8-1/2 percent.  Metro 

Chicago has added 183,000 jobs since 2009, just below the rate for job gains nationwide.1 

But while there has been steady progress, there is also no doubt that the economy 

and the job market are not back to normal health.  That will not be news to many of you, 

or to the 348,000 people in and around Chicago who were counted as looking for work in 

                                                 
1 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, total nonfarm employment for the Chicago-Joliet-Naperville 
metropolitan division has increased 183,000 since December 2009, or about 5 percent.  Over this period, 
employment nationally has increased about 6 percent.

January.2  It will not be news to consumers or to owners of small and medium-sized 

businesses, who surveys say remain cautious about the strength and durability of the 

recovery.  

The recovery still feels like a recession to many Americans, and it also looks that 

way in some economic statistics.  At 6.7 percent, the national unemployment rate is still 

higher than it ever got during the 2001 recession.  That is also the case in Chicago and in 

many other cities.  It certainly feels like a recession to many younger workers, to older 

workers who lost long-term jobs, and to African Americans, who are facing a job market 

today that is nearly as tough as it was during the two downturns that preceded the Great 

Recession.   

In some ways, the job market is tougher now than in any recession.  The numbers 

of people who have been trying to find work for more than six months or more than a 

year are much higher today than they ever were since records began decades ago.  We 

know that the long-term unemployed face big challenges.  Research shows employers are 

less willing to hire the long-term unemployed and often prefer other job candidates with 

less or even no relevant experience.3 

That is what Dorine Poole learned, after she lost her job processing medical 

insurance claims, just as the recession was getting started.  Like many others, she could 

not find any job, despite clerical skills and experience acquired over 15 years of steady 

employment.  When employers started hiring again, two years of unemployment became

a disqualification.  Even those needing her skills and experience preferred less qualified 

workers without a long spell of unemployment.  That career, that part of Dorine’s life, 

had ended.   

For Dorine and others, we know that workers displaced by layoffs and plant 

closures who manage to find work suffer long-lasting and often permanent wage 

reductions.4  Jermaine Brownlee was an apprentice plumber and skilled construction 

worker when the recession hit, and he saw his wages drop sharply as he scrambled for 

odd jobs and temporary work.  He is doing better now, but still working for a lower wage 

than he earned before the recession.  

Vicki Lira lost her full-time job of 20 years when the printing plant she worked in 

shut down in 2006.  Then she lost a job processing mortgage applications when the 

housing market crashed.  Vicki faced some very difficult years.  At times she was 

homeless.  Today she enjoys her part-time job serving food samples to customers at a 

grocery store but wishes she could get more hours.   

Vicki Lira is one of many Americans who lost a full-time job in the recession and 

seem stuck working part time.  The unemployment rate is down, but not included in that 

rate are more than seven million people who are working part time but want a full-time 

job.  As a share of the workforce, that number is very high historically.

I have described the experiences of Dorine, Jermaine, and Vicki because they tell 

us important things that the unemployment rate alone cannot.  First, they are a reminder 

that there are real people behind the statistics, struggling to get by and eager for the 

opportunity to build better lives.  Second, their experiences show some of the uniquely 

challenging and lasting effects of the Great Recession.  Recognizing and trying to 

understand these effects helps provide a clearer picture of the progress we have made in 

the recovery, as well as a view of just how far we still have to go.   

And based on the evidence available, it is clear to me that the U.S. economy is 

still considerably short of the two goals assigned to the Federal Reserve by the Congress.  

The first of those goals is maximum sustainable employment, the highest level of 

employment that can be sustained while maintaining a stable inflation rate.  Most of my 

colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I estimate that the unemployment 

rate consistent with maximum sustainable employment is now between 5.2 percent and 

5.6 percent, well below the 6.7 percent rate in February.   

The other goal assigned by the Congress is stable prices, which means keeping 

inflation under control.  In the past, there have been times when these two goals 

conflicted--fighting inflation often requires actions that slow the economy and raise the 

unemployment rate.  But that is not a dilemma now, because inflation is well below 

2 percent, the Fed’s longer-term goal.  

The Federal Reserve takes its inflation goal very seriously.  One reason why I 

believe it is appropriate for the Federal Reserve to continue to provide substantial help to 

the labor market, without adding to the risks of inflation, is because of the evidence I see 


 - 7 - 

that there remains considerable slack in the economy and the labor market.  Let me 

explain what I mean by that word “slack” and why it is so important. 

Slack means that there are significantly more people willing and capable of filling 

a job than there are jobs for them to fill.  During a period of little or no slack, there still 

may be vacant jobs and people who want to work, but a large share of those willing to 

work lack the skills or are otherwise not well suited for the jobs that are available.  With 

6.7 percent unemployment, it might seem that there must be a lot of slack in the U.S. 

economy, but there are reasons why that may not be true.   

One important reason relates to the skills and education of people in the 

workforce.  It is no secret that America faces some daunting challenges in educating 

people and preparing them to work in a 21st century, globalized economy.  Many of you 

in this audience are helping workers address this challenge, but you also know that the 

economy continues to change very rapidly.   

To the extent that people who desire to work lack the skills that employers are 

demanding, there is less slack in the labor market.  This is an example of what 

economists call “structural” unemployment, and it can be difficult to solve.  Even 

understanding what workers need to appeal to employers is difficult in a fast-changing 

economy.  For government, effective solutions for structural unemployment, beginning 

with improved education, tend to be expensive and take a long time to work.  The 

problem goes deeper than simply a lack of jobs.   

But a lack of jobs is the heart of the problem when unemployment is caused by 

slack, which we also call “cyclical unemployment.”  The government has the tools to 

address cyclical unemployment.  Monetary policy is one such tool, and the Federal 


 - 8 - 

Reserve has been actively using it to strengthen the recovery and create jobs, which 

brings me to why the amount of slack is so important.   

If unemployment were mostly structural, if workers were unable to perform the 

jobs available, then the Federal Reserve’s efforts to create jobs would not be very 

effective.  Worse than that, without slack in the labor market, the economic stimulus from 

the Fed could put attaining our inflation goal at risk.  In fact, judging how much slack 

there is in the labor market is one of the most important questions that my Federal 

Reserve colleagues and I consider when making monetary policy decisions, because our 

inflation goal is no less important than the goal of maximum employment.  

This is not just an academic debate.  For Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and 

Vicki Lira, and for millions of others dislocated by the Great Recession who continue to 

struggle, the cause of the slow recovery is enormously important.  As I said earlier, the 

powerful force that sustains them and others who keep trying to succeed in this recovery 

is the faith that their job prospects will improve and that their efforts will be rewarded.   

Now let me explain why I believe there is still considerable slack in the labor 

market, why I think there is room for continued help from the Fed for workers, and why I 

believe Dorine Poole, Jermaine Brownlee, and Vicki Lira are right to hope for better days 

ahead. 

One form of evidence for slack is found in other labor market data, beyond the 

unemployment rate or payrolls, some of which I have touched on already.  For example, 

the seven million people who are working part time but would like a full-time job.  This 

number is much larger than we would expect at 6.7 percent unemployment, based on past 

experience, and the existence of such a large pool of “partly unemployed” workers is a 


 - 9 - 

sign that labor conditions are worse than indicated by the unemployment rate.  Statistics 

on job turnover also point to considerable slack in the labor market.  Although firms are 

now laying off fewer workers, they have been reluctant to increase the pace of hiring.  

Likewise, the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs is noticeably below levels 

before the recession; that is an indicator that people are reluctant to risk leaving their jobs 

because they worry that it will be hard to find another.  It is also a sign that firms may not 

be recruiting very aggressively to hire workers away from their competitors. 

A second form of evidence for slack is that the decline in unemployment has not 

helped raise wages for workers as in past recoveries.  Workers in a slack market have 

little leverage to demand raises.  Labor compensation has increased an average of only a 

little more than 2 percent per year since the recession, which is very low by historical 

standards.5  Wage growth for most workers was modest for a couple of decades before 

the recession due to globalization and other factors beyond the level of economic activity, 

and those forces are undoubtedly still relevant.  But labor market slack has also surely 

been a factor in holding down compensation.  The low rate of wage growth is, to me, 

another sign that the Fed’s job is not yet done. 

A third form of evidence related to slack concerns the characteristics of the 

extraordinarily large share of the unemployed who have been out of work for six months 

or more.  These workers find it exceptionally hard to find steady, regular work, and they 

appear to be at a severe competitive disadvantage when trying to find a job.  The concern 

is that the long-term unemployed may remain on the sidelines, ultimately dropping out of 

                                                 
5 From 2010 to 2013, average annual growth in compensation per hour, hourly compensation as measured 
in the Employment Cost Index and average hourly earnings for all employees in private industries--all 
independent estimates of wage and compensation growth--increased annually, on average, no more than 2-
1/4 percent.  


 - 10 - 

the workforce.  But the data suggest that the long-term unemployed look basically the 

same as other unemployed people in terms of their occupations, educational attainment, 

and other characteristics.  And, although they find jobs with lower frequency than the 

short-term jobless do, the rate at which job seekers are finding jobs has only marginally 

improved for both groups.  That is, we have not yet seen clear indications that the short-

term unemployed are finding it increasingly easier to find work relative to the long-term 

unemployed.  This fact gives me hope that a significant share of the long-term 

unemployed will ultimately benefit from a stronger labor market.  

A final piece of evidence of slack in the labor market has been the behavior of the 

participation rate--the proportion of working-age adults that hold or are seeking jobs.  

Participation falls in a slack job market when people who want a job give up trying to 

find one.  When the recession began, 66 percent of the working-age population was part 

of the labor force.  Participation dropped, as it normally does in a recession, but then kept 

dropping in the recovery.  It now stands at 63 percent, the same level as in 1978, when a 

much smaller share of women were in the workforce.  Lower participation could mean 

that the 6.7 percent unemployment rate is overstating the progress in the labor market. 

One factor lowering participation is the aging of the population, which means that 

an increasing share of the population is retired.  If demographics were the only or 

overwhelming reason for falling participation, then declining participation would not be a 

sign of labor market slack.  But some “retirements” are not voluntary, and some of these 

workers may rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy.  Participation rates have been 

falling broadly for workers of different ages, including many in the prime of their 

working lives.  Based on the evidence, my own view is that a significant amount of the 


 - 11 - 

decline in participation during the recovery is due to slack, another sign that help from 

the Fed can still be effective.  

Since late 2008, the Fed has taken extraordinary steps to revive the economy.  At 

the height of the crisis, we provided liquidity to help avert a collapse of the financial 

system, which enabled banks and other institutions to continue to provide credit to people 

and businesses depending on it.  We cut short-term interest rates as low as they can go 

and indicated that we would keep them low for as long as necessary to support a stronger 

economic recovery.  And we have been purchasing large quantities of longer-term 

securities in order to put additional downward pressure on longer-term interest rates--the 

rates that matter to people shopping for a new car, looking to buy or renovate a home, or 

expand a business.  There is little doubt that without these actions, the recession and slow 

recovery would have been far worse. 

These different measures have the same goal--to encourage consumers to spend 

and businesses to invest, to promote a recovery in the housing market, and to put more 

people to work.  Together they represent an unprecedentedly large and sustained 

commitment by the Fed to do what is necessary to help our nation recover from the Great 

Recession.  For the many reasons I have noted today, I think this extraordinary 

commitment is still needed and will be for some time, and I believe that view is widely 

shared by my fellow policymakers at the Fed.   

In this context, recent steps by the Fed to reduce the rate of new securities 

purchases are not a lessening of this commitment, only a judgment that recent progress in 

the labor market means our aid for the recovery need not grow as quickly.  Earlier this 


 - 12 - 

month, the Fed reiterated its overall commitment to maintain extraordinary support for 

the recovery for some time to come. 

This commitment is strong, and I believe the Fed’s policies will continue to help 

sustain progress in the job market.  But the scars from the Great Recession remain, and 

reaching our goals will take time.  In the meanwhile, the Federal Reserve will continue to 

expand its efforts to promote community development.  The Board and each of the 

12 Reserve Banks have community development staff members who focus on improving 

the availability of financial services in low- and moderate-income communities.  They 

help bankers comply with the Community Reinvestment Act, but they are also a source 

of research and a facilitator of communication among financial institutions and 

practitioners to identify and share best practices.   

This conference is one example of how the Fed pursues those goals, and I would 

like to mention a few of the Fed’s other community development initiatives that I find 

particularly promising.  In 2012, The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco partnered 

with the Low Income Investment Fund (LIIF), a community development financial 

institution that bridges the gap between low-income neighborhoods and private capital 

sources, to publish the book Investing in What Works for America’s Communities.  This 

book cited innovative and effective community development initiatives across the 

country and advocated for a “Community Quarterback” model to coordinate initiatives 

and better leverage funding among groups with similar goals.   

In a similar way, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston has been the catalyst for the 

Working Cities Challenge, inspired by its own research on cities that managed to 

diversify away from a declining, manufacturing-based economy.  The research found that 


 - 13 - 

one key to success is “collaborative leadership,” when governments, businesses, and 

nonprofits unite behind one focused approach.  The Working Cities Challenge promotes 

that principle by inviting smaller Massachusetts cities to consider how they would use 

collaborative leadership to unite their communities to address a major challenge for 

lower-income residents.  Twenty cities competed for $1.8 million in funding from the 

state and other sources.  Six cities were awarded funds this past January, but many more 

will benefit from the spread of a new approach to capacity building that Fed research 

shows helps communities thrive.   

Leadership recruitment is also at the heart of a grassroots-oriented program called 

Economic Avenue that was developed by the Kansas City Fed.  In Northeast Kansas City, 

Kansas, residents and neighborhood leaders are forming a leadership council that will 

have responsibility for managing the program, which aims to create and grow local 

businesses, create jobs, and promote homeownership.  The bank’s community 

development staff is providing education and training to get the council off the ground, 

will measure and evaluate its progress, and assist in connecting leaders to resources and 

other programs.  

These examples are just a few among many throughout the Federal Reserve 

System.  By testing ideas, developing better measurement tools, convening interested 

parties, and sharing the Federal Reserve’s skills and knowledge with our partners at the 

national and local levels, we aim to serve as a catalyst to improve lives.   

Through these initiatives, together with the use of monetary policy and steps to 

safeguard the financial system, the Federal Reserve is committed to strengthening 

communities and restoring a healthy economy that benefits all Americans.  It is my hope 


 - 14 - 

that the courageous and determined working people I have told you about today, and 

millions more, will get the chance they deserve to build better lives.
