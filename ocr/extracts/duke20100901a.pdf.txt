September 1, 2010


Good morning.  I want to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board for this two-day 

summit to examine the problems associated with vacant and abandoned property and to explore 

innovative approaches to neighborhood stabilization. 

We are certain to have an informative and thoughtful discussion of these issues as our 

agenda is full of experts, including Shaun Donovan, Secretary for the Department of Housing 

and Urban Development, who will deliver a keynote address.   

Like you, I am anxious to get started.  But before I begin, I would like to recognize and 

thank the speakers and panelists we will hear from during the conference.  I would also like to 

acknowledge those who contributed to the new volume of papers the Federal Reserve published 

in conjunction with this event.  Many of our panelists contributed to the volume; their articles 

give us a look at the issue from every angle, provide great insight, and offer promising solutions.  

And I would note that a number of participants and contributors are current or former members 

of the Federal Reserve Consumer Advisory Council (CAC).  The CAC has been instrumental in 

furthering our understanding of emerging consumer and community issues, including the topic 

that brings us together today.   Finally, I would like to thank the Federal Reserve staff that 

worked tirelessly on this project. 

When it became apparent in 2007 that foreclosures were reaching epidemic levels in 

cities nationwide, the first priority of many community organizations and their public and private 

partners was to identify ways to mitigate the impact of foreclosure on individual homeowners 

and their families.  To assist in these efforts, the Federal Reserve deployed a number of 

resources:   

• We developed tools for community organizations to use in identifying areas with 

high default rates so that they could target their counseling resources effectively.

• We helped to organize many foreclosure assistance fairs that brought lenders, 

counselors, and other resources to individual borrowers.  

• We created foreclosure toolkits for communities.  

• We launched a public information campaign to warn consumers about foreclosure 

rescue scams.   

Despite these and other efforts to help mitigate foreclosures, however, we also recognized 

that many homeowners would not be able to remain in their homes and that, in time, the 

community development field would need to turn its attention to the impact of vacant and 

abandoned properties on communities.  While foreclosure mitigation focuses on the risk to 

individual homeowners, neighborhood stabilization focuses on the impact of foreclosures on 

others--the neighbors, communities, and municipalities that share the consequences of 

foreclosure. 

We were pleased to be able to support early efforts by NeighborWorks America to 

educate community development practitioners and public officials on issues related to 

neighborhood stabilization.  Under this partnership, NeighborWorks launched a website, 

stablecommunities.org, to provide community leaders with the latest information and resources 

on neighborhood stabilization.  In addition, NeighborWorks developed three new learning 

courses on stabilization strategies that are offered nationwide through NeighborWorks’ Training 

Institute as well as in place-based training settings.   

The Federal Reserve also hosted a series of forums in 2008 entitled, Recovery, Renewal, 

Rebuilding: A Federal Reserve System Foreclosure Conference Series.  The series highlighted 

strategies and best practices for addressing foreclosures in both strong and weak market cities.  

These forums were part of a larger initiative to integrate the Federal Reserve’s research and

outreach resources in addressing the foreclosure crisis.  This integration improved our ability to 

identify problems and highlight potential solutions--an effort that continues today with this 

summit and its accompanying publication.  

Most recently, we worked with the other federal financial regulatory agencies to propose 

amendments to the regulations implementing the Community Reinvestment Act.  The proposed 

amendments provide incentives for banks to participate in community stabilization activities in 

areas designated as eligible for funds under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) 

authorized by Congress.   

I would like to take a few minutes now to introduce the types of issues that are faced by 

communities with high rates of foreclosure and REO, and to discuss the gravity of the problem.  

I will also highlight some of the lessons we have learned in the last few years about effective 

neighborhood stabilization strategies, lessons that will be discussed in much greater detail 

throughout the course of this meeting.  

Neighborhood Stabilization 

Yvonne Means, a 74-year old resident of the southeast side of Cleveland, was recently 

interviewed for a National Public Radio story on that city’s efforts to combat the effects of 

foreclosure on its neighborhoods.  Her story was a familiar one:  foreclosed homes on her street 

are vacant and in disrepair, lawns are uncut, and weeds are taking over.  Her home, appraised at 

$70,000 in 2004, was recently valued at $50,000, a nearly 30 percent drop in value.  The loss of 

equity due to neighboring foreclosures represents a very real concern for homeowners, 

particularly older homeowners who might have expected that home equity would serve as a 

cushion in retirement.  But interestingly, Yvonne Means wasn’t focused on her financial loss

nearly as much as she was her social loss.  Ms. Means told the interviewer that she no longer 

invites friends over to her home because of her embarrassment about the condition of her street. 

I have visited the southeast side of Cleveland and have seen first-hand the challenges 

faced by homeowners.  There is a large inventory of homes that have gone through the 

foreclosure process and are now owned by financial institutions.  These properties are often 

referred to as REO, or “real estate owned,” which is how they are recorded on bank balance 

sheets.   

Our conference publication includes an article by Frank Ford, of Cleveland-based 

Neighborhood Progress, Inc., that paints a very troubling picture of the impact of a large number 

of foreclosures in a once vibrant community.  Ford estimates that every blighted house in 

Cleveland can negatively impact five or six other houses near it.  Homeowners in close 

proximity to foreclosures experience even greater losses in value than the general price declines 

that occur as a market absorbs a large number of distressed sales.  With an estimated 11,500 

vacant houses in Cleveland, Ford calculates that some 60,000 occupied homes will likely be 

impacted.1

The challenges associated with REO are not exclusive to older cities, such as Cleveland 

or Detroit, where economic forces have long threatened the sustainability of large infrastructures 

that support fewer residents.  Carolina Reid, of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has 

  Even worse, as he explains, is that losses don’t stop at home equity:  tax revenues 

decline and along with them the financial support necessary to provide for public schools, police, 

fire, and social services.  Neighborhoods that were once vibrant have, in many cases, become 

blighted, and the resources necessary to address the problem are scarce.

Mikelbank, “Spatial Analysis of the Impact of Vacant, Abandoned and Foreclosed Properties,” Federal Reserve 
Bank of Cleveland, November 2008.  Mikelbank finds that vacant properties have a significant impact on the home 
values of neighboring properties.

written an article that describes how formerly thriving subdivisions outside of larger 

metropolitan areas, once known as “boomburbs,” are now suffering some of the highest rates of 

foreclosure and subsequent REO inventories.  These communities are often so new that they do 

not have the community development infrastructure to address the impact of the large volume of 

REO properties.  While REO properties in these relatively strong markets are more attractive to 

investors, the nature of these communities may change dramatically with little opportunity for 

local government to direct--or even prepare for--those changes.     

To make matters even more challenging, potential REO inventories may be larger than 

the current inventory numbers indicate.  The Brooking Institution’s Alan Mallach provides us 

with an article that focuses on the growing number of properties that are delinquent or in the 

foreclosure process, but have not yet entered the market as REO.  This “shadow inventory” 

threatens to continue the downward pressure on housing prices and further destabilizes 

communities.  On a more positive note, however, Mallach contends that the neighborhood 

impact of REO properties can be mitigated if subsequent owners have a long-term interest.  He 

points out that the community impact of an REO property purchased by an individual homebuyer 

is barely noticeable.  Moreover, purchases by investors that plan to buy and hold the property for 

the long term can have positive outcomes for neighborhoods.  Finally, Mallach asserts that local 

governments are not powerless to limit the destructive impact of speculative investors.  Rather, 

he argues that they can influence investor behavior through the use of regulatory tools, such as 

licensing and inspections, to promote stability.  

The challenges faced by communities with large inventories of REO and vacant property 

will not be resolved overnight.  What began as a problem rooted in poorly underwritten loans has 

been exacerbated by high unemployment and slow economic growth.  As delinquencies and 


- 6 - 
 


foreclosures continue to grow, they will hinder the ability of communities to heal and ultimately 

to thrive.  So it only makes sense that we focus our research, data analysis, outreach, and 

community development expertise on better understanding the market dynamics of the 

communities impacted by foreclosures and identify solutions to help speed their recovery. 

Lessons Learned 

This summit brings together people who have been on the front lines of addressing vacant 

and abandoned properties throughout this crisis--local government officials, community 

development practitioners, lenders, servicers, and researchers--to share their experiences for the 

common good.  Thanks to the work of Community Affairs staff at the Boston and Cleveland 

Reserve Banks and here at the Board, we have been able to document many of these lessons in 

the conference publication.  While I don’t want to spoil the plot, I do want to use the remainder 

of my time to preview some of the most important lessons about community stabilization.  

First, we have learned that effective interventions emerge when there is a full 

understanding of mortgage markets, their dynamics, and incentives.  Several articles describe the 

steep learning curve that policymakers have navigated in order to effectively implement the NSP 

created by Congress and to utilize the $6 billion in funds made available through the first two 

rounds of the program.  These funds were provided to help stabilize neighborhoods through the 

acquisition, rehabilitation, financing, demolition, and land banking of properties that are 

blighting communities. While NSP funds were intended to provide an aggressive response to the 

forces destabilizing communities, time limits, such as the requirement that grantees obligate 

funds within 18 months, often underestimated the time needed to navigate the property 

disposition process, especially when paired with the myriad other requirements and limitations 

on uses of the funds.

The complexities of the secondary mortgage market have made it difficult for local 

governments and community organizations to ascertain who owns a particular property, much 

less arrange for its purchase in a timely way.  The pooling of mortgages in securities further 

complicates the process, making it difficult for municipalities to acquire one or two properties 

among many.  Several articles in our publication discuss the challenges of using NSP funds, 

particularly in a competitive environment where investors have the resources to purchase 

properties in bulk without the constraints related to neighborhood stabilization plans.   

Craig Nickerson’s article, for example, describes the efforts of the National Community 

Stabilization Trust (NCST), which was established to create local capacity so that communities 

could effectively acquire, manage, rehabilitate, and sell foreclosed properties.  Despite a slow 

start, NCST now has transactional expertise, development infrastructure, asset management 

skills, land banking approaches, and the comprehensive planning necessary to effectively utilize 

NSP funds for REO acquisition.  I also commend the article by Stergios (Terry) Theologides, 

which serves as a primer on servicing arrangements, the fiduciary relationship between servicers 

and investors, and the imbedded incentives that drive servicer decisionmaking.  It is a cogent 

explanation of a complex set of relationships that are key to better understanding and negotiating 

the intricacies of REO acquisition.        

The second important lesson learned in working with communities to effectively put NSP 

dollars to work is that good data are necessary to target scarce resources.  The funds provided 

under NSP, while substantial, are not nearly sufficient to tackle the entire inventory of vacant 

and abandoned homes.  But the strategic use of these funds can help to stabilize individual 

neighborhoods.

In his article, Ira Goldstein emphasizes the difference between stabilizing neighborhoods 

and impacting individual properties.  He describes a data-based tool developed by the 

Reinvestment Fund to characterize the underlying dynamics of local real estate markets.  Their 

Market Value Analysis is based on a set of indicators drawn from local administrative records 

and third-party data sources.  Indicators include such things as median sales prices, number of 

sales as a percent of housing units, foreclosure filings as a percentage of sales, percentage of 

commercial properties, percentage of tax abated properties or newly constructed properties, 

percentage of owner-occupied properties, and residential vacancy rates.  Data such as these are 

analyzed on a census tract basis, making them small enough to capture slight variations in 

community character but large enough to be reliably aggregated for mapping and statistical 

analysis.     

Using such analysis, communities can more effectively decide where NSP funds will 

have the greatest impact.  For example, using Philadelphia data, Goldstein begins by identifying 

neighborhoods eligible for use of NSP funds.  He further calculates the percentage of 

foreclosures in each neighborhood that could be addressed using NSP funds.  He argues that, 

from the standpoint of neighborhood stabilization, the best use of funds is in neighborhoods 

where there is the intersection of 1) a demonstrated need combined with the ability to impact a 

significant fraction of foreclosures, 2) the absence of other significant barriers to revitalization, 

and 3) the presence of additional strengthening factors, such as the strength of surrounding 

neighborhoods.  Combining indicators-of-need with indicators-of-probable-success within data-

driven analytical tools can help communities strategically invest scarce dollars to build on 

community strengths and remove barriers to community success.  This approach also helps 

communities to leverage other funding in the context of a larger community stabilization plan.

Data-based decisionmaking is not as easy as it sounds.  In fact, the third lesson we have 

learned is that we need to use technology to create better decisionmaking tools to assist 

communities.  Claudia Colton, Michael Schramm, and April Hirsh describe Case Western 

University’s work to support community organizations by providing critical data and information 

to help them determine which properties are priorities for acquisition and rehabilitation, keep 

abreast of current property conditions, and monitor issues as they arise.  This means keeping up-

to-date records of foreclosures, sheriff’s sales, and the REO status of properties, as well as 

gathering information on vacancies and tax delinquencies that can serve as a proxy for 

identifying properties that may be falling into delinquency.  These researchers are also using 

technology to develop tools to help communities strategically invest in areas with significant 

needs, but also great potential.  Moreover, they recognize the need for tools to help community 

organizations monitor the ongoing conditions in their neighborhoods so that they can anticipate 

and plan for bumps along the road to recovery. 

The partnership between Case Western and its Cleveland community partners is a fine 

example of the fourth lesson we have learned from this crisis:  the need to collaborate in new 

ways in order to develop a comprehensive approach to neighborhood stabilization efforts.  

Researchers from Case Western are part of a Neighborhood Stabilization Team that meets 

monthly to exchange information on the status of particular properties and discuss intervention 

strategies.  The conference publication is replete with examples of local collaborations that have 

successfully addressed neighborhood stabilization issues through partnerships between federal, 

state, and local governments, community organizations, lenders, servicers, universities, 

foundations, and others.  Moreover, the most promising initiatives that you will be hearing about 

over the next two days take a comprehensive view of community development.

It is not sufficient, given current economic conditions and the significant needs of our 

neighborhoods, to do things the way we have always done them.  Homeownership, long 

promoted by federal policy and facilitated by local housing organizations, cannot and should not 

be the only alternative for REO properties.  Indeed, redevelopment strategies profiled in the 

conference publication include rental housing, lease-purchase, and even converting owners to 

renters to avoid vacancies.  Including rental options among the mix of stabilization strategies 

makes particular sense at a time of high unemployment.  Even in the best of times, 

homeownership limits mobility in the labor market.  

Today’s summit and companion publication also highlight several promising models of 

“non-redevelopment” to stabilize communities, such as simple code enforcement, land banking, 

and demolition.  The scale of the problem is such that communities must consider a variety of 

strategies to repurpose REO properties within the context of a comprehensive plan that addresses 

a variety of community needs.  Only in this way will our neighborhoods be restored to health and 

vitality. 

This brings me back to Yvonne Means and her street in Cleveland.  Her plight illustrates 

that while it is important to avoid foreclosures whenever possible, it is equally important to pay 

attention to the properties that despite everyone’s best efforts will end up in foreclosure or worse, 

will become vacant and abandoned with no one even willing to take responsibility through 

foreclosure.  We owe it to Yvonne Means and others like her to work to repair the financial and 

social damage, and restore services to the remaining homeowners in communities with high rates 

of vacancy and foreclosure.  The problems caused by foreclosure are not solved until properties 

are restored to responsible ownership and occupied by families who call them home.

Neighborhood stabilization is not just sound economic policy, it is rooted in a vision of our 

shared future, our sense of community.   

Conclusion  

In conclusion, I want to thank you for being here and especially for your work to promote 

neighborhood stabilization.  The program today is certainly not the end of this project.   I am 

pleased to say that, as a follow-up to this summit, the Federal Reserve and NeighborWorks will 

be working together to provide technical workshops for communities as they implement some of 

the strategies identified here.  As of now, we have scheduled workshops in Providence, Rhode 

Island and Cleveland, Ohio this fall and plans are underway to schedule similar workshops on 

the West Coast.  I look forward to your participation and feedback today and to new partnerships 

going forward as we continue to identify ways to streamline the process of repurposing REO and 

to address the community development needs of neighborhoods that have been harmed by 

foreclosures.
