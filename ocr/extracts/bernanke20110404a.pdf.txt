April 4, 2011 





I am pleased to speak once again at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 

Financial Markets Conference.  This year’s conference covers an interesting mix of 

topics bearing on the vital ongoing global debate on how best to prevent and respond to 

financial crises.  

 Tonight I would like to discuss post-crisis reform as it relates to a prominent part 

of our financial market infrastructure--namely, clearinghouses for payments, securities, 

and derivatives transactions.  This audience, I know, recognizes the importance of what is 

often called the “plumbing” of the financial system--a set of institutions that very safely 

and efficiently handles, under most circumstances, enormous volumes of financial 

transactions each day.  Because clearinghouses and other parts of the financial 

infrastructure fared relatively well during the crisis--despite moments of significant 

stress--the public debate on financial reform has understandably focused on the risks 

posed by so-called too-big-to-fail financial firms, whose dramatic failures or near failures 

put our financial system and economy in dire jeopardy.  Nevertheless, the smooth 

operation and financial soundness of clearinghouses and related institutions are essential 

for financial stability, and we must not take them for granted.   

Importantly, title 8 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) contains provisions aimed at improving the 

transparency, resilience, and financial strength of clearinghouses, which the act calls 

financial market utilities.  Recognizing the systemic importance of clearinghouses, title 8 

also challenges U.S. regulatory authorities to improve and better coordinate their 

oversight of these institutions.  Moreover, to put into effect the macroprudential or 

systemic approach to regulation and oversight encouraged by the Dodd-Frank Act,

regulators will have to work to gain greater insight into the complex linkages among 

clearinghouses as well as those between clearinghouses and the financial firms that rely 

on and support them. 

 The Development of Clearinghouses and Their Economic Rationale  

 Clearinghouses have been around a long time and have been used for many types 

of transactions, yet virtually all clearinghouses perform certain basic functions.  Notably, 

by centralizing and standardizing specific classes of financial transactions, clearinghouses 

reduce the costs and operational risks of clearing and settlement among multiple market 

participants.  In many cases they also act as a guarantor of transactions--the counterparty 

to every trade--thereby helping to reduce counterparty credit and liquidity risks.  

However, the flip side of the centralization of clearing and settlement activities in 

clearinghouses is the concentration of substantial financial and operational risk in a small 

number of organizations, a development with potentially important systemic 

implications.  Because the failure of, or loss of confidence in, a major clearinghouse 

would create enormous uncertainty about the status of initiated transactions and, 

consequently, about the financial positions of clearinghouse participants and their 

customers, strong risk management at these organizations as well as effective prudential 

oversight is essential. 

 A historical perspective is helpful for understanding the economics of 

clearinghouses and the implications of their operations for financial stability.  The first 

important clearinghouse in the United States, the New York Clearing House, was 

founded by New York City’s commercial banks in 1853 to streamline the clearing and 

settling of checks.  By one account, before the New York Clearing House was set up, the 




- 3 -

clearing and settlement process involved employees from 60 banks crisscrossing each 

other’s paths through the city streets to present checks, a time-consuming process filled 

with “confusion, disputes and unavoidable blunders.”1  The establishment of the 

clearinghouse improved the situation almost immediately, resulting in significant savings 

in time, effort, and financial costs.2  By the late 19th century, check clearinghouses had 

been established across the United States.3  Large segments of the financial system came 

to rely on the efficiency and integrity of daily settlements by the clearinghouses.  Indeed, 

as these institutions developed, the roles of clearinghouses and clearinghouse 

associations--the groups of firms that used and supported individual clearinghouses--went 

well beyond purely operational functions:  In the years prior to the establishment of the 

Federal Reserve, to increase public confidence in banks, clearinghouse associations at 

times took on quasi-governmental supervisory functions--for example, by examining the 

financial condition of members rumored to be experiencing difficulties--and even served 

at times as lender of last resort to individual clearinghouse members. 

 In the securities and derivatives markets, the story unfolded a bit later and was 

more complex than in the case of checks.  Nevertheless, many of the essential themes are 

the same.  In 1892, on the centennial of the famous Buttonwood Agreement, the New 

York Stock Exchange took its first steps to improve clearing and settlement by creating a

clearinghouse for limited types of brokers’ trades.4  Faced with growing volumes of 

trading and the associated clearing costs after World War I, the New York Stock 

Exchange took a further step in 1920 by establishing the Stock Clearing Corporation; this 

new clearinghouse reduced the number of checks needed for settlements by up to 90 

percent and the volume of funds and credit needed by 70 percent or more.5 

   It was not until the dramatic increase in equity trading volumes in the late 1960s, 

however, that backlogs of trading tickets, confirmations, and delivery instructions caused 

the infamous “paperwork crisis” that led the exchange to curtail trading hours and close 

on Wednesdays for six months in order to manage the situation.6  The paperwork crisis 

represented more than a set of operational problems for financial institutions and other 

market participants.  Unprocessed instructions and delivery failures also increased the 

financial risks faced by many firms, leading to supervisory concerns about the ability of 

firms to control and monitor their securities holdings and exposures and to manage their 

financial positions appropriately.  

 These risks clearly needed to be addressed.  Pressed by the Congress and 

regulators, the industry began in the mid-1970s to establish central securities depositories 

and central counterparties (CCPs) to immobilize paper certificates, encourage multilateral 

netting of trades, reduce pre-settlement risk through the guarantee of trades, and conduct 

securities settlements through “book entries” to electronic records. The result of these 

efforts was a set of critical electronic infrastructures to centralize and coordinate clearing

and settlement, including the establishment of CCPs to provide settlement guarantees and 

reduce counterparty risk.  

The market for government securities saw reforms as well, following the failures 

in the early 1980s of several smaller government securities dealers and increasing 

concerns about the integrity of clearing in that market.  In 1986, authorities and market 

participants developed a CCP for over-the-counter (OTC) government securities trades to 

augment bilateral clearing, at the time the dominant practice.  Today, this CCP is part of 

the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, a subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing 

Corporation.     

 In the case of exchange-traded derivatives, the significant benefits of 

clearinghouses likewise became apparent over time.  The Chicago Board of Trade 

(CBOT), now part of the CME Group, was established in 1848.  After various 

experiments to manage the paperwork associated with growing trading volumes, the 

CBOT established a clearinghouse in 1883.  Although the role of the clearinghouse was 

initially limited, it significantly reduced back-office work and the amount of funds and 

credit needed by its members.7  In 1925, the members of the CBOT set up a full-fledged 

and independent central counterparty--The Board of Trade Clearing Corporation, now 

called The Clearing Corporation--to provide the guarantee and settlement functions that 

are familiar today.8  Risk-management tools such as margining systems and default funds 

were adopted to backstop the guarantee provided by the clearinghouse.  The use of CCPs

for exchange-traded derivatives continues to evolve.  For example, a new CCP that 

combines the clearing of futures on Eurodollars and U.S. Treasury securities with 

positions in fixed-income instruments, New York Portfolio Clearing, launched in March.     

Clearinghouses and Financial Crises 

 As clearinghouses developed, their resilience--in particular, their ability to 

manage their liquidity and ensure the integrity of transactions under stressed conditions--

was tested by financial shocks and crises.  I’ll briefly discuss three historical episodes 

that tested the financial infrastructure:  the financial panic of 1907, the 1987 stock market 

crash, and the recent crisis.  Although the clearinghouses of the time survived all of these 

episodes, in each case the problems they faced demonstrated potential vulnerabilities and 

a need for reform.  More generally, these episodes warn us to remain vigilant and to 

guard against complacency; complexity and change in the financial system will continue 

to present new challenges to stability, as they have in the past.  

 I noted earlier the development of clearinghouses for checks in cities around the 

country in the second half of the 19th century.  In the financial panic of 1907, which 

involved depositor runs on banks and trust companies in New York and elsewhere, check 

clearinghouses struggled to obtain the liquidity needed to complete daily settlements.  To 

avoid settlement failures and address a wider need for liquidity, including liquidity being 

demanded by the anxious depositors of troubled banks, many clearinghouses followed a 

practice that sprang up shortly after the founding of the New York Clearing House.  

Specifically, members of the clearinghouse, as a group, issued collateralized loans in the 

form of “clearinghouse loan certificates” to those members that were short of liquidity 

needed for settlements; in a real sense, the clearinghouse served as a private-sector lender 




- 7 -

(or liquidity provider) of last resort.  Some clearinghouses even issued small-

denomination certificates that circulated widely outside the clearinghouse as a substitute 

for currency.9  Although these measures were helpful, demands grew for public action to 

address the problem of recurrent panics.  These demands ultimately led to the formation 

of the Federal Reserve in 1913, in part to act as a liquidity provider of last resort as well 

as to strengthen the supervision of state-chartered banks. 

  Eighty years later, the 1987 stock market crash provided a marketwide test for 

securities and derivatives clearinghouses, as well as their members, banks, and related 

institutions.10  Surging volumes of trades and extraordinary price volatility during the 

week of October 19th created errors and delays in confirming stock trades, severe 

operational and financial stress at clearing members, and heavy liquidity demands 

throughout the financial markets.11  In the derivatives markets, multiple intraday margin 

calls were made to protect the clearinghouses, but banks sometimes delayed making key 

payments to and from the clearinghouses, adding to the uncertainty.  Meanwhile, the 

clearinghouses themselves apparently absorbed significant amounts of intraday liquidity 

from the markets by collecting, but not always paying out, so-called variation margin--

payments that investors were required to make as the values of their holdings plunged.  In 

reviewing the episode, the Brady Commission noted that although the clearinghouse

system avoided defaults, investor uncertainties about the viability of the clearinghouses, 

as well as about the ability of major broker-dealers to meet their obligations, intensified 

market fluctuations and panic.12  In response, the public and private sectors worked 

together to address the weaknesses that had been revealed--for example, by clarifying the 

obligations that clearinghouses, clearing members, and settlement banks must assume and 

by bolstering the liquidity and security of the financial resources of clearinghouses.13  

 In 2008, clearinghouses and their members were again tested by significant 

financial shocks, both in the United States and abroad.  Although the events of 2008 were 

not centered in equity-related markets, the measures taken after 1987 no doubt 

contributed to the resilience of clearing arrangements in the securities and derivatives 

markets.  The official sector’s support arrangements for financial firms and markets, 

including the Federal Reserve’s discount window lending and special liquidity programs, 

also indirectly eased liquidity pressures on the clearinghouses.  In the global foreign 

exchange market, CLS Bank International, a system that began operating in 2002 with 

the purpose of addressing settlement risk, is widely credited with maintaining confidence 

for continued interbank trading and settlement of foreign exchange. 

 Overall, the historical record shows that clearinghouse arrangements have 

generally withstood even severe crises.  This solid performance reflects good planning 

and sound institutional structures but also some degree of good luck, as crises have also 

revealed important vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities which prompted subsequent reforms by

both the private and public sectors.  Clearly, if we do not want to put all our trust in 

continued good fortune, we will have to continue to be proactive in identifying and 

remedying weaknesses in these critical infrastructures. 

Clearinghouses and Financial Reform 

 Broadly speaking, the recent financial reform legislation bears on the future 

structure and role of clearinghouses in two different ways.  First, it aims to increase the 

resilience of these critical institutions against severe financial shocks, the issue that I have 

emphasized thus far.  Second, it also encourages the greater development and use of 

clearinghouses to address weaknesses identified in other parts of the financial system.  Of 

course, increased reliance on clearinghouses to address problems in other parts of the 

system increases further the need to ensure the safety of clearinghouses themselves.  As 

Mark Twain’s character Pudd’nhead Wilson once opined, if you put all your eggs in one 

basket, you better watch that basket. 

The theme of expanded use of clearinghouses as a tool to address other problems 

in the system is perhaps best illustrated by the derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank 

Act.  Prior to the crisis, some of the same economic forces that had led to the 

development of clearinghouses for other instruments were already pushing industry 

participants toward greater use of clearinghouses for OTC derivatives transactions.  For 

example, as one response to the growth of the market for interest rate swaps in the early 

1990s, a clearinghouse was created in London in 1999 that, by the onset of the financial 

crisis, was handling a major portion of interdealer activity in those swaps.14  Also, in the 

                                                 
14 See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems and the Euro-Currency Standing Committee of the 
Central Banks of the Group of Ten Countries (1998), OTC Derivatives:  Settlement Procedures and 
Counterparty Risk Management (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for International Settlements, September), 
www.bis.org/publ/cpss27.pdf.

years leading up to the crisis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York initiated joint 

efforts with other regulators and market participants to improve clearing arrangements for 

credit default swaps.  However, for several reasons, the willingness of market participants 

to move all derivatives transactions to clearinghouses was limited.  Notably, many 

believed that the standardization of derivatives contracts that is needed for multilateral 

clearing imposed too high a cost on end users with needs for customized arrangements.  

Market participants also were concerned that the establishment of clearinghouse 

guarantees might require implicit subsidies from clearinghouse members with stronger 

credit to those with weaker credit. 

 These calculations, however, were substantially changed by the galvanizing 

events of 2008, notably the development of large and uncertain counterparty credit risks 

in many bilateral derivatives agreements.  On the heels of the crisis, the Group of Twenty 

countries endorsed a policy of mandatory central clearing for standardized OTC 

derivatives.  The aim was to reduce systemic risk in the financial system more broadly as 

well as to improve the transparency of the OTC derivatives markets.  In the United 

States, title 7 of the Dodd-Frank Act incorporated a mandatory clearing policy for 

standardized derivatives.  Other major countries are following suit.  In the spirit of 

keeping a close eye on the basket, as dependence on clearinghouses grows, private-sector 

participants and regulators will need to review risk-management and member-default 

procedures for financial market utilities to ensure that they meet high standards of safety. 

 As I mentioned, strengthening the financial infrastructure is indeed a key theme of 

the Dodd-Frank Act.  Title 8 addresses several prudential issues associated with clearing 

and settlement.  One important provision provides additional authority for U.S. regulators 




- 11 -

to set enhanced and consistent risk-management standards for systemically important 

financial market utilities, taking into consideration relevant international standards and 

existing prudential requirements.  Another provision encourages more intensive 

supervision of clearinghouses (including required annual examinations) along with 

strengthened cooperation among the relevant regulatory agencies.  And, as in other major 

countries, Dodd-Frank permits systemically important financial market utilities to apply 

for accounts at the central bank (in the U.S. context, at the Federal Reserve Banks) and to 

obtain payment services.  These utilities could also be given access to emergency credit if 

private-sector sources are exhausted, under terms set by the Board and subject to 

authorization by the Board in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury.   

As is well understood, the existence of emergency credit facilities for financial 

market utilities could give rise to moral hazard (for example, in the form of insufficient 

attention by clearinghouses to establishment of private-sector liquidity arrangements in 

advance of a crisis).  To minimize moral hazard concerns, the Federal Reserve believes it 

essential that the regulatory regime for these institutions include strong prudential 

requirements for credit and liquidity risk management, robust liquidity buffers, the 

maintenance of adequate amounts of high-quality collateral, and effective member-

default procedures.   

The Board is working hard to implement the new statutory provisions of title 8.  

We are actively collaborating with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and 

the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) on the setting of regulatory 

standards and plans for the supervision of financial market utilities.  We have recently 

published for comment proposed risk-management standards that would apply to 




- 12 -

financial market utilities that would be supervised by the Board under title 8.  These 

standards track the existing standards published in the Board’s Payment System Risk 

Policy, which in turn are based on existing international standards.     

 For the longer term, the Federal Reserve is working closely with the SEC and the 

CFTC as well as securities regulators and central banks from more than 20 other 

countries to revise and strengthen the existing international standards for the major types 

of financial market utilities.  This work is being carried out by the Committee on 

Payment and Settlement Systems and by the Technical Committee of the International 

Organization of Securities Commissions.  These two committees published new 

international standards for public consultation in March.  We hope that the regulatory 

agencies in the United States, and those in other major countries, can adopt a single set of 

enhanced risk-management standards that will apply to all systemically important 

financial market utilities globally.   

Coordination among regulators, both within and between countries, is especially 

important in light of the increasing interdependencies among financial market utilities 

around the world.15  What was once a landscape of numerous, separate clearinghouses 

that operated largely independently from one another has now become dominated by 

fewer and larger clearinghouses supporting more integrated markets and consolidated, 

global financial firms.  Moreover, the same globally active banks participate in all of the 

major clearinghouses, and the major clearinghouses often rely on similar sets of banks for 

payment services, funding, settlement, and emergency liquidity.  In such a world, 

                                                 
15 Reflecting on these changes, a 2008 report by the Bank for International Settlements Committee on 
Payment and Settlement Systems noted the extensive scope of interdependencies among these financial 
market utilities.  See Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (2008), The Interdependencies of 
Payment and Settlement Systems (Basel, Switzerland: BIS, June), www.bis.org/publ/cpss84.pdf.

problems at one clearinghouse could have significant effects on others, even in the 

absence of explicit operational links.  The need for strong risk management and oversight 

will only increase as we go forward. 

Conclusion 

 Clearinghouses around the world generally performed well in the highly stressed 

financial environment of the recent crisis.  However, we should not take for granted that 

we will be as lucky in the future.  Past crises, including the financial panic of 1907 and 

the 1987 stock market crash, led to significant reforms and improvements in clearing and 

settlement that paid off in subsequent periods of financial stress.  Given the growing 

interdependencies among clearinghouses, along with the new mandates for central 

clearing, now is a good time to reflect on the lessons of the recent crisis and consider 

whether further improvements are possible. 

 For more than a century, financial stability has depended on the resilience under 

stress of clearinghouses and other parts of the financial infrastructure.  As we rely even 

more heavily on these institutions in the United States and around the world, we must do 

all that we can to ensure their resilience, even as our financial system continues to evolve 

rapidly and in ways that we cannot fully predict.  In short, I think Pudd’nhead Wilson 

would agree that that is one important basket.
