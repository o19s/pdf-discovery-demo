Issues in Economic Development 




Remarks by 

Elizabeth A. Duke 

Member 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

International Economic Development Council’s 

Federal Economic Development Forum 

Alexandria, Virginia 



Good afternoon.  I am pleased to address the International Economic Development 

Council’s (IEDC) Federal Economic Development Forum.  Before coming to the Federal 

Reserve, I spent 30 years as a banker, primarily as a community banker.  As such, I always 

recognized that the strength of my bank depended on the strength of the economy in my market 

area.  So I devoted quite a bit of time and attention to local economic development.  Within my 

market, I served at various times on a number of public and non-profit boards and commissions 

focused on regional development.  That experience gave me a deep appreciation of the 

challenges and accomplishments of those working in economic development at the local level.  

As a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I am more often focused on national 

economic issues, though even these are heavily influenced by the collective impact of economic 

and community development initiatives.  Nonetheless, as I prepared to come here today, I was 

struck by the wide range of activities and frequent interaction between the Federal Reserve 

System and economic development practitioners, both at the national and local level.  As many 

of you know, the Federal Reserve System is made up of the Board of Governors in Washington 

and 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country.  We have specialists throughout the System 

who routinely promote economic development successes through outreach and educational 

activities.  In fact, Federal Reserve staff members serve as advisers and board members to local 

economic development entities and even the IEDC.       

We’re involved in community economic development because we recognize that 

economic recovery, growth, and stability depend on job creation and the development of 

diversified and robust regional markets.  I plan to focus today on the Federal Reserve’s current 

research, policy, and related activities in three areas where, based on my experience, I believe

our concerns overlap with those of economic development professionals: small business lending, 

commercial real estate, and workforce development.     

Small Business Lending 

 This year I have been asked about the tightening of credit for small businesses more 

often than any other topic.  Many audiences, including economists, community bankers, and the 

Congress are enormously concerned about the issue.  Not surprisingly, the success of small 

businesses is important to economic developers as well.  Small businesses employ nearly 40 

percent of the private sector workforce, making them a key component of the job market and a 

building block of the economy.  The health of state and local economies is directly tied to the 

opportunity for small businesses to prosper. 

Despite the best efforts of bankers and regulators, small businesses are still finding it 

difficult to obtain credit.  A recent study conducted by the National Federation of Independent 

Business (NFIB) found that only about half of the small employers who attempted to borrow in 

2009 received all the credit they wanted.  Nearly one-quarter received no credit at all.  A similar 

study in 2005 found nearly 90 percent of small employers had most or all their credit needs met, 

and only 8 percent obtained no credit.  Even though conditions in financial markets have 

continued to improve this year, access to credit remains restricted for many smaller businesses.  

Several factors are contributing to the reduced supply of bank loans.  For instance, in 

response to an increase in the number of delinquent and nonperforming loans, many banks have 

reduced existing lines of credit sharply and have tightened their standards and terms for new 

credit.  In other cases, banks whose capital has been eroded by losses or who have limited access 

to capital markets may be reducing risk assets to improve their capital positions, especially amid 

continued uncertainty about the economic outlook and possible future loan losses.

But the reduction in the availability of credit is not the whole story.  There is also less 

demand for credit by sound firms.  As businesses reduced inventory levels and capital spending, 

they tended to pay down debt and build cash positions.  Indeed, in the most recent NFIB study, 

34 percent of businesses reported lower sales as their biggest problem while only 3 percent cited 

lack of credit.  And while some potential borrowers seek less credit, others are no longer 

qualified to borrow.  Weakened balance sheets, reduced income, falling real estate collateral 

values, and in some cases, a recent history of payment problems have made it difficult for some 

businesses and consumers to qualify for loans, especially under the current stricter standards. 

Other factors unique to the current financial environment may also be weighing on the 

ability of small businesses to borrow.  A significant portion of small businesses rely on the 

owners’ personal assets and credit to fund their operations.  As a result, small businesses are 

affected by tight consumer credit conditions, in addition to an unfavorable business credit 

climate.  Many small business owners rely on their homes or business real estate to secure their 

business loans.  As collateral values have declined, their borrowing capacity has been reduced. 

Finally, small business lending often is based on relationships that are solidified over time. 

Sometimes those relationships are broken as a result of the bank’s inability to lend, such as when 

the bank fails or when it reduces lending because of strains on or concentrations in its own 

portfolio.  Small businesses may then find it quite difficult to establish similar arrangements with 

a new bank.  

Given the challenges facing small businesses, the Federal Reserve has sought to ease the 

flow of credit and better understand the nuances of the credit tightening.  Ultimately, the most 

effective way for policymakers to improve credit availability to small businesses, as well as other 

businesses and households, is to undertake efforts that support a sustainable economic recovery.

With this in mind, the Federal Reserve over the past two years has taken strong action in 

response to the financial crisis to help improve financial market conditions and promote the flow 

of credit to households and businesses.  We have acted on multiple fronts by instituting 

accommodative monetary policy, expanding existing liquidity programs for depository 

institutions, and establishing new liquidity facilities to support market functioning.  Throughout 

this period, we have particularly emphasized ensuring that our supervision and examination 

policies do not inadvertently impede sound lending to businesses, both large and small, and we 

will continue to do so. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve System is hosting meetings with private- and public-

sector partners to highlight concerns facing small businesses.  Some of these meetings focus on 

general small business topics.  Others concentrate on subsegments of the market such as minority 

business owners or businesses located in low- and moderate-income areas.  We are in the midst 

of hosting more than 40 such gatherings across the country to collect data and glean perspectives 

that will help find ways to meet the immediate and intermediate financial needs of small 

businesses.  These meetings seek to identify existing credit gaps, share promising practices, and 

highlight regional differences as well as national themes in credit access and technical support 

for small businesses.  The key findings of these small business gatherings will be presented to 

policymakers later this summer. 

 Despite the difficulties in the small business lending market, I find reason to be 

optimistic about small business lending in the near future.  Improvements in conditions that 

depressed lending in 2009 lead me to believe that we will begin to see an increase in bank loans 

to small businesses later this year.  Notably, overall economic conditions, the most important 

determinant of the demand for and availability of small business lending, have improved 


- 5 - 
 


considerably since the early and middle part of last year.  In response, bank attitudes toward 

lending, including small business lending, may be shifting.  According to the Federal Reserve’s 

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey conducted in January, the number of banks that reported 

having eased credit standards for small business lending over the previous three months nearly 

matched the number that reported having tightened lending standards for the first time since 

before the crisis began, in the summer of 2007.1 

Commercial Real Estate 

I am sure that economic development professionals also are greatly concerned about the 

continuing deterioration of conditions in commercial real estate (CRE).  A solid real estate base 

is not only the foundation for commercial and retail centers, but communities also depend on 

these commercial corridors to supply services and jobs to their residents and contribute 

significantly to the local tax base.  I assure you that the Federal Reserve appreciates the 

consequences of weaknesses in commercial real estate and shares your concern. 

Unfortunately, the outlook for commercial real estate is not very favorable.  Hit hard by 

the loss of businesses and employment, much retail, office, and industrial space stands vacant.  

In addition, many businesses have cut expenses by renegotiating existing leases.  The 

combination of reduced cash flows and higher rates of return required by investors leads to lower 

valuations, and many existing buildings are selling at a loss.  As a result, credit conditions in this 

market are particularly strained.  Commercial mortgage delinquency rates have soared.  

According to our January survey of senior lending officers, banks continued to tighten standards 

on CRE loans and, presumably in light of the poor economic outlook for the sector, appear to 

have been reluctant to refinance maturing construction and land development loans.  In this

Survey on Bank Lending Practices.”

environment, a turnaround in CRE is likely to lag the improvement in overall economic activity.  

However, compared with the situation in the early 1990s, the problems in this sector now appear 

to be due largely to poor business fundamentals rather than widespread overbuilding, suggesting 

that the performance of the CRE sector will gradually begin to improve as the economy 

continues to strengthen. 

The Federal Reserve and other banking agencies issued a policy statement covering 

commercial real estate loans and loan workouts in October 2009--one of a series of actions taken 

to support sound bank lending.2  This guidance urges both lenders and bank examiners to take a 

balanced approach in assessing borrowers’ debt servicing capacity and to make realistic 

assessments of collateral values. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve has taken steps with bankers and examiners to reinforce 

the expectations outlined in the interagency policy statement.  For example, in January, Federal 

Reserve staff instituted an examiner training initiative that will underscore the importance of 

sound lending practices with Federal Reserve and state examiners across the United States.  

Additionally, we have developed an interagency training program specifically for examiners 

reviewing CRE loans as part of the interagency Shared National Credit Program, which covers 

large syndicated loans, including the largest commercial real estate loans in the nation.  

We are working hard to track the progress and effectiveness of this guidance and are 

exploring the feasibility of more formal statistical approaches for measuring and evaluating its 

effectiveness.  Preliminary analysis of recent data offers some encouragement that CRE 

refinancing and workouts are beginning to take place.  Notably, the volume of restructured 

troubled loans increased by almost 32 percent during the fourth quarter of 2009, the quarter in

which the guidance was issued.  And, while overall real estate lending continues to decline due 

to a sharp contraction in construction lending, loans outstanding in several other commercial real 

estate sectors increased modestly in the fourth quarter. 

Of course, the ability of economic development experts to impact the stability of the 

commercial real estate market should not be underestimated.  Your efforts to revive employment, 

retail sales, and business capital expenditures in your communities will be key to the recovery of 

commercial real estate values.  Focusing your efforts on bringing new tenants to existing 

commercial areas rather than developing new areas will also help to hasten the recovery.  I 

encourage you to be mindful of these options as you continue your work. 

Workforce Development 

Finally, I would like to emphasize the importance of workforce development as a means 

for attracting and keeping businesses and jobs in your community.  Few tools in the economic 

development arsenal are as powerful as those that successfully match workers and jobs.  Federal 

Reserve research has uncovered a number of strategies that are especially promising for such 

matches.  But before I get to them, let me provide some recent data on the grim employment 

picture that makes the success of such strategies so critical. 

The unemployment rate has held at 9.7 percent for the past few months and job market 

conditions remain weak.  While job growth in March may be the first welcome sign that the 

worst is over in terms of job loss, approximately 8 million jobs have been lost in the past three 

years, and it will take sustained, robust job growth for some time to return all those workers to 

jobs.  Other indicators also suggest a challenging employment picture ahead.  Specifically, data 

collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates the unemployed, on average, are remaining 


- 8 - 
 


unemployed longer than in the past.  And more people are underemployed as employers reduce 

costs by shifting to part-time staffing models. 3    

So far, most of the stabilization in the unemployment rate has come from a sharp 

reduction in layoffs and terminations.  We have not yet seen any substantial improvement in 

hiring rates.  Aggressive moves by businesses to reduce costs by cutting jobs and work hours 

have resulted in solid gains in aggregate productivity.  This bodes well for increased employment 

in the coming year, but I anticipate that employers will add jobs cautiously in order to preserve 

these cost savings and efficiency gains for as long as possible. 

Improvement in labor market conditions is clearly a key component of a sustained 

economic recovery.  It is important to note that unemployment is not distributed evenly across all 

segments of the population.  Men, young workers, and low-skilled job seekers are 

disproportionately affected by current job losses.4  Most notably for purposes of this discussion, 

the prolonged unemployment of so many low-skill workers, in particular, is increasing the 

demand for training and education.   

Retraining workers to acquire the skills demanded in today’s job market is an ongoing 

challenge as employment shifts away from low-skill manufacturing toward the service sector, 

technology, and health care.  The recent economic crisis and the rise in unemployment have only 

made the need to retrain workers more urgent.   

Effective workforce development is necessary to ensure that workers have the skills they 

need to find new employment and that communities have a consistent supply of well-qualified 

workers to remain competitive.  Traditional workforce development strategies include pre-

employment training and job placement to help low- and moderate-income people transition

from one job to another.  Most commonly, this involves occupational training through certificate 

and degree programs, but it also includes the training and development workers receive from 

employers.   

Workforce development initiatives primarily focus on making job seekers “job ready.”  

Given the current unemployment rate, governments and community organizations have 

understandably focused on projects and programs that will create new jobs and ensure that 

workers are available to fill them.  Yet, even in this economy, some jobs go unfilled because 

individuals lack the necessary skills.  Skill gaps could constrain long-term employment growth.  

Indeed, some 88 million Americans have at least one educational barrier, such as no high school 

degree, no postsecondary training, or deficient English language skills.  And, as I noted, longer 

average duration of unemployment may be eroding the skills of the jobless.5 

While broad investments in human capital and workforce development are clearly 

needed, it is not easy to determine how to ensure that those investments are effective and cost-

efficient.  The Federal Reserve System is engaged in ongoing research to identify best practices 

and establish methods for measuring the success of workforce development programs.  For 

example, the System’s Community Affairs function studied various workforce development 

needs and responses as part of its examination of the impact of concentrated poverty on lower-

income individuals.  In its report, The Enduring Challenge of Concentrated Poverty in America, 

published in 2008, findings from 16 case studies confirmed that a skilled labor force is a key 

attraction for other drivers of community success, including lower crime rates, outside 

investment, and access to employment.  As a result, many of the case study communities actively

Briefing Paper,” (New York: Surdna Foundation, December).

promote strategies that address barriers to work and connect adults to employment 

opportunities.6  

Among the successful strategies identified in the concentrated poverty case studies, the 

report noted that community colleges have effectively filled educational gaps in communities 

where limited educational attainment among residents and insufficient job readiness were 

particularly pronounced.  In Cleveland, for example, residents who once worked in 

manufacturing lacked the necessary skills to obtain other available jobs, particularly in the 

growing health care sector.  To address this problem, the Cuyahoga County Community College 

designed an innovative program to help individuals with limited formal education enter health 

care through a nursing assistant training program. The program offers both immediate 

employment opportunities and the potential for additional credentials necessary to advance to 

other jobs along the occupational ladder.   

In El Paso, Texas, the community developed Project ARRIBA, a labor market 

intermediary that provides clients with training through El Paso Community College.  The 

training focuses on the skills necessary for local job demands in fields such as health care, 

education, and information technology.   

More recently, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis conducted a study of 

the effectiveness of community colleges in advancing the economic well-being of students and 

found that students who attend a community college gain economic advantages in the job 

market, even without completing a degree.  A review of research on using community colleges 

for retraining older displaced workers found that one year at a community college increases the 

long-term earnings of those workers by about 9 percent for men and about 13 percent for

women, when compared to earnings for similar workers who did not attend community college.  

The majority of these gains were from math, science, and other technically oriented courses.7  

In addition to the need to bridge a substantial skills gap in many job markets, the 

challenge of connecting the residents of poor neighborhoods to jobs often entails overcoming 

informational and transportation barriers.  These problems are illustrated by the Federal Reserve 

Bank of Boston’s research and fieldwork in Springfield, Massachusetts.  Springfield was one of 

the concentrated poverty case studies.  The Boston Bank noted that Springfield residents with a 

high school education were less likely to be employed than similarly educated residents of 

comparable cities.  The Reserve Bank’s research found that Springfield area employers rely 

heavily on referrals from existing employees in the screening process for entry-level jobs.  

Unfortunately, many residents of the poor neighborhoods of Springfield lack connections to 

current jobholders, putting them at a disadvantage relative to other job seekers.  In many cases, 

they also lack the transportation options necessary to reach potential jobs.  For example, 

manufacturing, construction, and other jobs suitable to the residents’ competencies increasingly 

require that they commute outside of Springfield’s urban core.  However, low car-ownership 

rates among inner-city residents and limited public transportation options during nights and 

weekends and to suburban locations can exacerbate the challenges of connecting with job 

opportunities.  As a follow up to the case study, the Boston Bank recommended expanded 

training, internship, mentorship, outreach, and other programs designed to develop Springfield’s 

human capital and job market connections.  Moreover, the Reserve Bank has encouraged 

employers and public officials to devise solutions to address commuting difficulties.

Mobility.”

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond also identified transportation for 

low-income workers across the country as an important barrier to income stability.  The 

Richmond Bank found that higher-paying jobs tend to be located on the outer fringes of 

metropolitan areas, at a distance from many people seeking jobs.  Moreover, many of the jobs in 

growth sectors, such as health care and technology, tend to have varying shifts, which makes 

using public transportation difficult.   The Richmond Bank co-hosted an event, Cars and 

Working Families, to build support for the concept that car ownership has become a necessity 

rather than a privilege for working people.  The event highlighted some of the barriers to auto 

ownership among lower-income workers, including the cost of insurance, mandatory driving 

classes that are primarily taught in English, and significant license fees.  Since then, the 

Richmond Bank has undertaken an initiative to focus community organizations, community 

development foundations, and the financial industry on the importance of car ownership to a 

person’s ability to hold a job that pays a living wage.   

As you can see, the Federal Reserve is not only working to improve the national 

economic outlook, but it is also engaged in some very local initiatives designed to identify and 

address barriers to employment for those most impacted by recent job losses.  We are committed 

to continue lending our research and outreach resources to assist in these and other promising 

community economic development initiatives.  

Conclusion 

 In conclusion, I commend the work that you do in communities across the country.  

Having been involved in several economic development initiatives as a community banker, I 

know how complicated it is to build vision and consensus among local stakeholders.  While 

current economic circumstances are challenging, the work you do has never been more important

to the communities you serve.  I hope that the Federal Reserve’s activities in the areas of small 

business, commercial real estate, and workforce development that I described have given you an 

insight into how we are trying to mitigate the economic downturn’s impact on communities.  We 

look forward to continued dialogue and partnership with you as we seek to find ways to hasten 

recovery and rebuild communities.
