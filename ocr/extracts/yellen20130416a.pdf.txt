Thank you to the International Monetary Fund for allowing me to take part in 

what I expect will be a very lively discussion.1 

Only five or six years ago, there wouldn’t have been a panel on the “many 

instruments” and “many targets” of monetary policy.  Before the financial crisis, the 

focus was on one policy instrument:  the short-term policy interest rate.  While central 

banks did not uniformly rely on a single policy target, many had adopted an “inflation 

targeting” framework that, as the name implies, gives a certain preeminence to that one 

objective.  Of course, the Federal Reserve has long been a bit of an outlier in this regard, 

with its explicit dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.  Still, the 

discussion might not have gone much beyond “one instrument and two targets” if not for 

the financial crisis and its aftermath, which have presented central banks with great 

challenges and transformed how we look at this topic.   

Let me start with a few general observations to get the ball rolling.  In terms of the 

targets, or, more generally, the objectives of policy, I see continuity in the abiding 

importance of a framework of flexible inflation targeting.  By one authoritative account, 

about 27 countries now operate full-fledged inflation-targeting regimes.2  The United 

States is not on this list, but the Federal Reserve has embraced most of the key features of 

flexible inflation targeting:  a commitment to promote low and stable inflation over a 

longer-term horizon, a predictable monetary policy, and clear and transparent 

communication.  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) struggled for years to 

formulate an inflation goal that would not seem to give preference to price stability over 

                                                 
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve 
System.

maximum employment.  In January 2012, the Committee adopted a “Statement on 

Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” which includes a 2 percent longer-run 

inflation goal along with numerical estimates of what the Committee views as the longer-

run normal rate of unemployment.  The statement also makes clear that the FOMC will 

take a “balanced approach” in seeking to mitigate deviations of inflation from 2 percent 

and employment from estimates of its maximum sustainable level.  I see this language as 

entirely consistent with modern descriptions of flexible inflation targeting.   

For the past four years, a major challenge for the Federal Reserve and many other 

central banks has been how to address persistently high unemployment when the policy 

rate is at or near the effective lower bound.  This troubling situation has naturally and 

appropriately given rise to extensive discussion about alternative policy frameworks.  I 

have been very keen, however, to retain what I see as the key ingredient of a flexible 

inflation-targeting framework:  clear communication about goals and how central banks 

intend to achieve them.   

With respect to the Federal Reserve’s goals, price stability and maximum 

employment are not only mandated by the Congress, but also easily understandable and 

widely embraced.  Well-anchored inflation expectations have proven to be an immense 

asset in conducting monetary policy.  They’ve helped keep inflation low and stable while 

monetary policy has been used to help promote a healthy economy.  After the onset of the 

financial crisis, these stable expectations also helped the United States avoid excessive 

disinflation or even deflation.   

Of course, many central banks have, in the wake of the crisis, found it challenging 

to provide appropriate monetary stimulus after their policy interest rate hit the effective

lower bound.  This is the point where “many instruments” enters the discussion.  The 

main tools for the FOMC have been forward guidance on the future path of the federal 

funds rate and large-scale asset purchases.   

The objective of forward guidance is to affect expectations about how long the 

highly accommodative stance of the policy interest rate will be maintained as conditions 

improve.  By lowering private-sector expectations of the future path of short-term rates, 

this guidance can reduce longer-term interest rates and also raise asset prices, in turn, 

stimulating aggregate demand.  Absent such forward guidance, the public might expect 

the federal funds rate to follow a path suggested by past FOMC behavior in “normal 

times”--for example, the behavior captured by John Taylor’s famous Taylor rule.  I am 

persuaded, however, by the arguments laid out by our panelist Michael Woodford and 

others suggesting that the policy rate should, under present conditions, be held “lower for 

longer” than conventional policy rules imply.   

I see these ideas reflected in the FOMC’s recent policy.  Since September 2012, 

the FOMC has stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain 

appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  Since 

December 2012, the Committee has said it intends to hold the federal funds rate near zero 

at least until unemployment has declined below 6-1/2 percent, provided that inflation 

between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than 1/2 percentage point 

above the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations 

continue to be well anchored.  I believe that the clarity of this commitment to 

accommodation will itself support spending and employment and help to strengthen the 

recovery.

Asset purchases have complemented our forward guidance, and the many 

dimensions of different purchase programs arguably constitute “many instruments.”  In 

designing a purchase program, one must consider which assets to buy:  Just Treasury 

securities or agency mortgage-backed securities as well?  Which maturities?  The Federal 

Reserve, the Bank of England, and, more recently, the Bank of Japan have emphasized 

longer-duration securities.  At what pace should the securities be purchased?  And how 

long should they be held once purchases cease?  Each of these factors may affect the 

degree of accommodation delivered.  Two innovations in the FOMC’s current asset 

purchase program, for example, are that it is open-ended rather than fixed in size like past 

programs, and that the overall size of the program is explicitly linked to seeing a 

substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.   

In these brief remarks, I won’t thoroughly review the benefits or costs of our 

highly accommodative policies, emphasizing only that I believe they have, on net, 

provided meaningful support to the recovery.  But I do want to spend a moment on one 

potential cost--financial stability--because this topic returns us to the theme of “many 

targets” for central banks.  As Chairman Bernanke has observed, in the years before the 

crisis, financial stability became a “junior partner” in the monetary policy process, in 

contrast with its traditionally larger role.  The greater focus on financial stability is 

probably the largest shift in central bank objectives wrought by the crisis.   

Some have asked whether the extraordinary accommodation being provided in 

response to the financial crisis may itself tend to generate new financial stability risks.  

This is a very important question.  To put it in context, let’s remember that the Federal 

Reserve’s policies are intended to promote a return to prudent risk-taking, reflecting a 


 - 5 -

normalization of credit markets that is essential to a healthy economy.  Obviously,  

risk-taking can go too far.  Low interest rates may induce investors to take on too much 

leverage and reach too aggressively for yield.  I don’t see pervasive evidence of rapid 

credit growth, a marked buildup in leverage, or significant asset bubbles that would 

threaten financial stability.  But there are signs that some parties are reaching for yield, 

and the Federal Reserve continues to carefully monitor this situation.   

However, I think most central bankers view monetary policy as a blunt tool for 

addressing financial stability concerns and many probably share my own strong 

preference to rely on micro- and macroprudential supervision and regulation as the main 

line of defense.  The Federal Reserve has been working with a number of federal 

agencies and international bodies since the crisis to implement a broad range of reforms 

to enhance our monitoring, mitigate systemic risk, and generally improve the resilience of 

the financial system.  Significant work will be needed to implement these reforms, and 

vulnerabilities still remain.  Thus, we are prepared to use any of our many instruments as 

appropriate to address any stability concerns.   

Let me conclude by noting that I have touched on only some of the important 

dimensions of monetary policy targets and instruments that have arisen in recent years.  I 

look forward to a discussion that I expect will explore these issues and perhaps raise 

others.
