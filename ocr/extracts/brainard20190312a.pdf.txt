It is a pleasure to have an opportunity to discuss how we can preserve what is 

working well with the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) and make it better.1  In 

recent months, we have seen a high level of engagement from banks and community 

organizations in discussions and comments about revising the CRA regulations, which 

serves as testament to the value of the CRA and provides valuable suggestions for 

improving our regulatory approach.  The one message that comes through most clearly is 

that the CRA is highly valued by bankers and community groups alike.  A second 

message is that the CRA could be even more effective in mobilizing community and 

economic development. 

Purpose and History 

Before offering some thoughts on what we have learned and some possible ways 

forward, I want to begin by recalling why the CRA was established and what it was 

designed to achieve, as well as the important role it has played for over 40 years in low- 

and moderate-income communities across this country.  

The CRA was one of several landmark pieces of legislation to address inequities 

in the credit markets in the wake of the civil rights movement.  The Fair Housing Act of 

1968 and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 addressed lending discrimination in 

mortgage and consumer credit based on race, sex, and other personal characteristics, 

while the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) of 1975 and later amendments 

recognized the importance of data in making these laws enforceable.  In 1977, Congress 

passed the CRA to address the credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.

Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.

With the passage of the CRA, Congress aimed to reverse the urban disinvestment from 

years of government policies and market actions that deprived lower-income areas of 

credit by redlining--using red-inked lines to set apart neighborhoods that were deemed 

too risky.  

The CRA is unique in important ways.  Unlike previous government efforts to 

address the needs of lower-income areas, the CRA puts decisionmaking about a 

community’s needs and priorities in the hands of local actors.  By stipulating that banks 

have an affirmative and continuing obligation to meet the credit needs of all segments of 

the local communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income 

communities, the CRA changed the way banks approach their lending and investment 

decisions in those communities.  More than 40 years later, the CRA continues to animate 

a vibrant community development ecosystem connecting community members with the 

banks that lend and invest, community organizations that deliver services and develop 

housing, and state and local governments that direct incentives and subsidies.  We 

participate actively through our community development and examination staff around 

the country, who help to connect stakeholders, analyze community needs, and assess 

outcomes. 

A second unique feature is the public nature of evaluations.  The CRA, as 

amended in 1989, directs federal regulators to evaluate banks’ records of helping to meet 

the credit needs of their local communities and assign one of four statutorily mandated 

ratings to their performance.2  Following additional amendments in 1991, the law 

                                                 
2 The banking agencies are the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The ratings are: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, and 
Substantial Non-compliance.

requires that the agencies make public the banks’ ratings and the analysis supporting 

them.  The public nature of CRA evaluations provides a strong incentive for good 

performance as well as a platform for public input on community needs. 

Opportunities for Improvement 

Congress largely left it to the banking agencies to describe in regulations how 

they would evaluate a bank’s CRA performance.  This flexibility is valuable because it 

enables the agencies to revise the implementing regulations from time to time to keep the 

CRA relevant in response to technological innovation and other changes in the landscape 

for banking and community development financing.3       

The agencies have discussed revising the CRA regulations on and off since 2010, 

when interagency hearings were held in several locations across the country.  Last 

August, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued an Advance Notice 

of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) to request comments on a variety of questions related 

to defining the areas in which regulators evaluate a bank’s CRA performance, clarifying 

and expanding the types of activities that are eligible for CRA consideration, and 

establishing a metrics-based approach to rating a bank’s CRA performance, among other 

things.  The OCC received nearly 1,500 comment letters in response to the ANPR, and 

we have been reading those letters with great interest.   

To augment this analysis, since October, the Federal Reserve System has held 

more than 25 outreach meetings across the country with banks and community 

                                                 
3 The current regulatory structure dates back to 1995 when the agencies reworked the regulations to provide 
for a variety of evaluation methods for banks of different sizes and business strategies and set out criteria 
by which a bank’s lending, investment, and service activities in its community are evaluated.  There were 
further regulatory revisions in 2005.

organizations, including representation from the other banking agencies, culminating in 

an in-depth research symposium at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.    

Several themes are emerging from the comment letters and outreach.  Perhaps 

most important, stakeholders overwhelmingly support the CRA and its goals, noting a 

significant increase in loans and investments in low- and moderate-income communities 

since the law’s enactment.  Many commenters emphasize the importance of the CRA in 

supporting a vital community development ecosystem by bringing together banks, 

community organizations, state and local governments, educators, foundations, and other 

stakeholders to address community and economic development needs.  Many cautioned 

the banking agencies to proceed carefully so as not to disturb this important ecosystem.  I 

share this commitment to the CRA and to strengthening its role in community and 

economic development in the low- and moderate-income communities where it can make 

the greatest difference.    

Defining a Bank’s Community:  Where Activities Count  

Banks and community organizations agree that the regulations should better 

reflect the way in which banking products and services are currently delivered.  Much has 

changed since the last major revision to the CRA regulations, which occurred at a time 

when physical branches were essential for all the deposit and lending needs of bank 

customers.  The current definition of a bank’s assessment area--the area in which a 

bank’s performance is assessed--relies on the area around its main branches and deposit-

taking automated teller machines (ATMs), which includes a substantial portion of its 

lending.  The internet was just becoming available for commercial use when the current 

assessment area regulations were finalized.  Since that time, technology and changing 


 - 5 - 

consumer preferences have led to banks gathering deposits and making loans well outside 

of their physical branches--for example, online and via mobile devices.  So it is fair to ask 

whether the CRA’s current assessment area definition adequately reflects the community 

a bank serves today.    

Clearly, it is time to better define the area in which the agencies evaluate a bank’s 

CRA activities, but it is important to retain a focus on the credit needs of local 

communities.  As tempting as it may be to think that digital channels have rendered bank 

branches unnecessary, my discussions with banks and community stakeholders around 

the country have underscored the importance of branches as a venue for banks to engage 

with their communities.  Branches are the places that provide the personal face-to-face 

assistance valued by many consumers and business customers.  Moreover, branches 

provide a local presence for lenders to get to know the borrowers and the communities in 

which they live, lend, and invest.  While technology has much to offer by way of 

convenience and customer experience, it is often a complement to rather than a 

replacement for bank branches.  For this reason, and to be true to the original intent of the 

law, I believe that CRA evaluations should retain a focus on the credit needs of the local 

communities banks serve as indicated by their physical presence in those areas, but not be 

limited to where they have a physical presence.   

Each quarter, I have been fortunate to make community visits around the country 

along with Board and Reserve Bank community development staff.   I have seen 

firsthand the success of the CRA in bringing banks to the table along with community 

organizations to address complex community needs.   Recently, I met with bankers in 

Denver, Colorado, who were working with local government officials and nonprofits to 


 - 6 - 

maintain affordable housing near newly developed public transit lines.  In North St. 

Louis, I met with a community bank that was working with a place-based community 

development organization called Better Family Life to develop a micro-loan fund that is 

empowering low-income entrepreneurs.   

In other places, particularly in high-poverty and rural areas, I saw firsthand how 

difficult it can be to get access to basic banking services.  In a visit to the Mississippi 

Delta in 2016, I heard from community members about having to drive long distances to 

deposit a check or access an ATM.  The same was true for my visits to Pine Ridge, South 

Dakota and some towns in the Appalachian region of Kentucky.  There is a complex 

balancing between banks’ need to operate branches profitably with communities’ needs 

to connect to the financial mainstream, which we want to recognize in any revisions to 

the CRA regulations.  Bankers and other commenters have emphasized the high value 

that bank branches have for retail customers and small business owners in underserved 

communities, and research corroborates this.   

Similar to banks, community organization commenters support updating the CRA 

regulations as they relate to a bank’s assessment area.  They suggest retaining assessment 

areas around a bank’s branches in order to retain the CRA’s focus on local low- and 

moderate-income neighborhoods, while adding areas where banks conduct significant 

activity without branches.   

Both bank and community organization commenters were open to having a larger 

area defined for the purposes of pursuing meaningful community development activities, 

particularly in cases where banks operate largely without branches.  By allowing for more 

activity in a broader geographic area, they argue that the artificial competition for 


 - 7 - 

investments in areas served by several banks (such as New York or Salt Lake City)--so-

called credit hot spots--could be mitigated.  This could be to the benefit of credit deserts--

those perennially underserved rural areas or small metropolitan areas that may not have a 

bank branch or, if they do, may not constitute a major market for purposes of banks’ 

CRA evaluations.    

In reflecting on these suggestions, we have been considering a possible approach 

that might rework the assessment area definition so that banks of a certain scale would 

have separate assessment areas for their retail activities and their community 

development activities.  This would retain the law’s focus on the credit needs of a bank’s 

local community by evaluating the retail lending and services it offers in the county or 

other geographic area surrounding its branches, deposit-taking ATMs, and other 

concentrations of lending and deposit-taking.4   

As part of this approach, a bank would get CRA consideration for community 

development activities in a more expansive area.  Under the current rule, there is no ex 

ante certainty that a bank’s community development activities will receive CRA 

consideration if they are in the broader statewide or regional area that includes the bank’s 

assessment area.  This current approach has proven challenging in practice, as banks 

sometimes invest in a community development activity only to find that their examiner 

doesn’t agree that the activity is located within the bank’s assessment area.   

Community development activities, in order to achieve an appropriate scale, often 

operate in larger areas that may not neatly overlap with a bank’s assessment area.  A 

more expansive and ex ante clearer community development assessment area definition 

                                                 
4 The agencies could consider requiring assessment areas around a bank’s other physical locations, such as 
loan production or trust offices, or in areas where the bank has significant deposit or lending activity.

would afford CRA consideration for any such activity in a state where the bank has an 

assessment area.  This approach would help eliminate uncertainty and could encourage 

more capital for affordable housing, community facilities, and economic development 

activities in underserved areas.  Moreover, a broader assessment area for community 

development activities could help address the concentration of investment dollars in 

metropolitan areas where several banks may have branches, while other smaller 

metropolitan and rural areas remain chronically underserved.   

My recent visit to the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota brought home the 

importance of addressing the problem of credit hot spots and deserts that result from the 

CRA’s current assessment area definition.  I met with the Thunder Valley Community 

Development Corporation and viewed their impressive 34-acre mixed-use project to 

create a new commercial center for the reservation.  When completed, it will include 

single-family and multifamily housing units, a boarding house for visitors, a community 

center, and a retail shopping area in a community where residents currently must drive an 

hour to reach a grocery store.  In examining a list of all the project funders, it was 

noticeable that there were active financing commitments from many foundations, but no 

banks.  Although this is likely to be a very impactful investment, there is only one bank 

currently whose assessment area may extend to Pine Ridge.  In contrast, under the 

proposed community development assessment area approach, more of the banks with  

branches in Aberdeen, South Dakota, for instance, might be inclined to make such a 

community development loan with confidence it would get CRA consideration.  

By creating separate assessment areas for retail and community development 

activities, we believe that banks would continue to place their community at the center of 


 - 9 - 

their retail lending and service activities while participating in meaningful community 

development opportunities that may have greater impact due to their broader reach.  

Evaluating Community Development Performance:  What Counts 

In reflecting on the comments, listening sessions, and research conference, we 

have also been contemplating approaches to what community development activities 

count in order to provide greater predictability and better incentives.  Banks and 

community organizations have noted that the current structure of the large bank 

performance tests may actually hinder community development financing in a couple of 

ways.  First, under the existing approach, community development loans are considered 

in the lending test, while community development investments are considered in a 

separate test.  A number of banks and community organizations argue that the form of 

community financing may be influenced more by the structure of the CRA performance 

tests than by what makes the most sense for the project.  For example, if a bank is 

concerned about passing its lending test, it might structure financing as a loan rather than 

an investment to beef up its lending test performance even if an investment would be 

more effective.   

Second, a number of banks and community organizations pressed the case for 

giving CRA consideration to any community development loan outstanding, rather than 

only those originated since the bank’s last CRA evaluation.  Under the current rule, banks 

often make short-term, renewable community development loans simply to ensure that 

the incremental lending receives CRA consideration at each examination.  By contrast, 

when it comes to investments, all investments on the bank’s books at the time of the 

evaluation are given consideration.  Banks and community organizations alike make a 


 - 10 - 

compelling argument that all types of community development finance, whether in the 

form of a loan or an investment, have greater impact when they serve as patient, reliable, 

committed sources of financing.  

One possible approach to address these distortions and provide more effective 

incentives is to create a separate, comprehensive community development test to evaluate 

community development loans and qualified investments through a similar lens, possibly 

along with community development services.  A separate, comprehensive community 

development test could encourage banks to provide the patient, committed financing--in 

the form of loans as well as investments--that community development organizations 

value the most.  This is important because banks are uniquely situated to evaluate the 

community development finance projects in the states where they operate and to provide 

the smaller, more complex, and often more impactful, investments that don’t attract 

institutional investors.  If banks cannot be confident ex ante that they will get the benefit 

of CRA consideration for these efforts, which may be time-consuming to evaluate and 

structure, it is not surprising they would instead gravitate toward activities they know will 

count.5    

In addition to these broad changes to what and how community development 

activities should be counted, we recognize there are several definitional issues that merit 

consideration.  For example, many commenters advocated for an expansion of the 

definition of “community development” to include loans to or investments in community 

                                                 
5 We recognize that the agencies will need to give careful consideration to how to weight community 
development loans, investments, and services, so as not to harm the complex system of community 
development financing that is dependent largely on CRA-motivated investments.   




 - 11 - 

development financial institutions (CDFIs), regardless of the bank’s assessment area, 

because the sole purpose of CDFIs is community development.  There are also 

suggestions that in high-poverty rural areas, where incomes overall may be low relative 

to federal benchmarks, it may be helpful to adjust the definition of what qualifies as low- 

and moderate-income so that more CRA activity receives consideration, which we will 

study. 

Tailoring 

Recognition of the variation in how banks deliver their products and services 

brings me to the third theme expressed by both banks and community organizations, 

which is the need for the CRA regulations to be flexible enough to evaluate banks of 

widely different sizes and business strategies.  Different perspectives were offered about 

some aspects of how to better tailor the regulations, particularly with regards to whether 

more banks should be considered “small” and, as such, eligible for a streamlined 

evaluation.     

Indeed, one of the benefits of creating separate assessment area definitions and 

performance tests for retail activities and community development activities could be 

streamlining the tests and applying them in different ways to tailor CRA evaluations to 

banks based on their size and business strategy.  Small banks could have their lending 

and retail services evaluated under the retail test, while larger banks could be evaluated 

under both the retail and community development tests.  The assessment area definition 

could be flexible enough to allow banks that conduct most or all of their retail activity 

online to identify states in which they have a significant level of deposits, lending, or 


 - 12 - 

other banking activity in which they would have obligations under either the retail or 

community development test, as appropriate.   

Consistency and Predictability 

There was also wide support for making CRA definitions and evaluation criteria 

clearer and taking other actions to improve the consistent and predictable application of 

the regulations during evaluations.  Perhaps more important, the commenters strongly 

supported the agencies continuing the tradition of working together to have one set of 

rules, consistent interpretive guidance, and regular examiner training to ensure that the 

CRA is implemented as consistently as possible both within and across the agencies.  At 

the Federal Reserve, we agree that it is important for the banking agencies to take a 

consistent approach. 

Metrics 

  Finally, there was broad support for expanding the use of metrics in CRA 

evaluations, where appropriate, especially if they are clearly articulated, are used in 

tandem with performance context information, and add to the transparency of CRA 

ratings.  We recognize that effective and predictable evaluations rely on good metrics.  

Metrics, in turn, require good data.  Currently, CRA evaluations use HMDA data, which 

are very useful in understanding where mortgages are made, to whom, and at what cost.  

Moreover, HMDA data are collected from both banks and non-bank mortgage lenders.  

But the data collected under CRA to support our analysis of small business and small 

farm loans are not as comprehensive as mortgage lending data.  The Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act charges the Consumer Financial Protection 

Bureau with promulgating regulations for the collection of small business loans, and that 


 - 13 - 

data should be very helpful when they become available.  Separately, the data collected 

under the CRA on community development loans are not adequate to support the analysis 

of a separate community development test, so it may be necessary to consider a better 

reporting system.  

Collecting data and developing clear metrics will provide the improved clarity 

and ex ante predictability that banks seek.  More and better data will allow for more 

meaningful metrics by which we can evaluate performance criteria, such as the borrower 

and geographic distribution of lending and how a bank’s performance compares with 

other similarly situated banks.  We may also consider providing more baseline 

information that describes a bank’s performance context, such as the demographic and 

economic information that helps to describe the credit needs and opportunities present in 

each assessment area.  In addition, there may be ways to more effectively incorporate 

community engagement into the process--for example, by having the banking agencies 

develop a joint community contacts database to facilitate access to information from local 

community stakeholders. 

Conclusion 

Overall, I have been impressed with the number of organizations that took the 

time to comment on the OCC’s ANPR to and attend the Federal Reserve’s outreach 

meetings.  It is encouraging to see the high level of commitment to the CRA from banks 

and community organizations alike.  As we think about the path forward, it is important 

that we retain the CRA’s core focus on place while improving upon the regulation’s 

flexibility in order to provide meaningful CRA evaluations of banks that largely deliver 


 - 14 - 

their products and services digitally.  We want whatever we design to be clear and more 

predictable for banks in order to promote more and more impactful CRA activity.   

Taken together, changes to the CRA regulations’ definition of assessment areas 

and performance test structure, along with improved metrics based on better data have the 

potential to enhance the regulations and better serve its purpose of encouraging banks to 

help meet the credit needs of low- and moderate-income communities.  We understand 

and appreciate that banks want to be able to make plans and manage their risks carefully 

through clearer standards regarding what counts, where it will be counted, and how.  If 

we can address these suggestions effectively, banks will be more effective in addressing 

the needs of their local communities and in some cases extend their activities to benefit 

chronically underserved communities. 

I will be interested to hear whether some of the ideas I have shared today resonate 

with you.  I want to assure you that we will continue to engage with bank and community 

stakeholders to find a path forward that honors the purpose of the CRA by encouraging 

banks to attend to the credit needs of their local communities and to better address the 

needs of underserved areas.  This engagement will be vital as we join together with the 

other banking agencies to formulate regulatory changes that preserve what is best about 

CRA while ensuring its value and relevance for another generation.
