Thanks for the opportunity to speak to you today.  In these brief remarks, I will 

discuss the progress of the economy and the path forward for monetary policy.1  The 

current expansion is almost six years old and is now one of the longest since World 

War II.  While the pace of improvement has at times been frustratingly slow, by some 

measures the recovery is now well advanced.  By other measures, there is still room for 

improvement.  Assessing the scope for further improvement will be important in judging 

the appropriate path for monetary policy. 

After its most recent meeting in March, the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) modified its forward guidance to say that an increase in the target range for the 

federal funds rate will be appropriate when the Committee has seen further improvement 

in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 

2 percent objective over the medium term.  Such an increase could come as soon as the 

June FOMC meeting.  The timing of liftoff and the pace of subsequent rate increases will 

depend on incoming data and on realized and expected progress toward our 

congressionally mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment.  Monetary 

policy works with long and variable lags, so rate increases need to begin well before we 

reach those goals.    

Let us turn to the two main economic conditions for liftoff that the Committee 

articulated.  We have already seen a great deal of progress in the labor market, and I 

expect that progress to continue.  Despite slowing in March, job creation has been 

particularly strong over the past two years.  The unemployment rate has declined from 

10 percent in October 2009 to 5.5 percent in March 2015, a level that is not far above

Federal Open Market Committee.

many estimates of its natural rate.  But the unemployment rate probably understates the 

amount of slack still remaining in the labor market.  The labor force participation rate 

continues to be unusually low, suggesting that potential workers may be waiting on the 

sidelines for further improvements in job opportunities and wages.  The number working 

part time who want full-time jobs also remains elevated.  The low level of wage increases 

also suggests additional slack. 

 The Committee said that it will want to be reasonably confident that inflation will 

move back to 2 percent over the medium term.  On a 12-month basis, headline inflation 

in February, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index, stood at 

0.3 percent; meanwhile, core inflation, which excludes volatile energy and food 

components, was 1.4 percent.  These low current readings are partly a consequence of 

two transient shocks--the dramatic decline in oil prices and the effect of the appreciation 

of the dollar on import prices.  Before those shocks, both headline inflation and core 

inflation were running at about 1.5 percent.  When the effects of these shocks pass, I 

expect that inflation will return roughly to those earlier levels and then rise gradually to 

our 2 percent objective over the medium term as labor and product markets tighten 

further.  Despite the current low inflation readings, survey-based measures of inflation 

expectations in the United States have been stable.  However, market-based readings on 

inflation compensation have declined significantly since mid-2014.  I view this decline as 

more likely reflecting movements in risk premiums and other transitory factors, rather 

than shifts in longer-term inflation expectations.  Still, it will be important to keep an eye 

on the performance of inflation breakevens.

I expect that economic conditions will support the first rate increase later this 

year.  I do not expect that such an increase or the associated market reaction will 

materially restrain the progress of the economy.  From a macroeconomic perspective, the 

precise timing of liftoff is less important than the path of subsequent additional rate 

increases.  My view is that, if the economy continues on its expected path, it will be 

appropriate for a time to increase rates fairly gradually.  Of course, if the economy 

improves faster or inflation increases more than expected, it will be appropriate to raise 

rates faster.  And if economic performance disappoints or inflation remains lower than 

expected, it will be appropriate to delay liftoff or raise rates more slowly thereafter. 

There are several reasons why it may be appropriate to raise rates somewhat 

gradually, including the proximity of the zero lower bound for interest rates and 

continuing economic headwinds in the wake of the crisis.2  I would like to explore a 

rationale that has received somewhat less attention, which is the unusually high level of 

uncertainty today about capacity measures such as the natural rate of unemployment.3  

Uncertainty about the precise level of these indicators becomes more important for policy 

as the expansion continues and the economy approaches its potential, defined as the level 

of output that is consistent with stable prices.

at “The New Normal Monetary Policy,” a research conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of 
San Francisco, San Francisco, March 27,

3 The natural rate of unemployment can be thought of as the unemployment rate at which the labor market 
is at its long-run equilibrium and inflation is stable.  We cannot directly observe the natural rate but must 
infer it based on the performance of wages, prices, and labor market indicators.  Most FOMC participants 
estimate that the longer-run normal rate is currently in the range of 5.0 to 5.2 percent.  Confidence intervals 
around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite wide.  For example, 
Staiger, Stock, and Watson estimate a 95 percent confidence range around the natural rate to extend nearly 
1½ percentage points on either side of the point estimate.  See Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark 
W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” in Christina D. 
Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and Strategy (Chicago:  University of 
Chicago Press).

All else equal, a decision to return interest rates to more-normal levels implies 

that the economy is nearing its capacity.  The financial crisis did significant damage to 

the productive capacity of our economy, and the damage was of a character, extent, and 

duration that cannot be fully known today.  Given this uncertainty, it is even more 

difficult than usual to assess how much slack remains.  It seems plausible that at least part 

of this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained 

growth.4  To encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing 

accommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets are 

tightening or other supply-side constraints are binding.  Of course, if the effects of the 

crisis prove difficult to reverse and, as a result, inflation pressures do emerge, the Federal 

Reserve will use its tools to contain them. 

Let us take a brief look at the implications of severe financial crises for economies 

generally.  Studies document that severe financial crises around the world have typically 

left behind large and sustained reductions in the level of output.5  The recent crisis is no 

exception, and figure 1 shows such an effect for the U.S., U.K., euro-area and Canadian

economies since 2008.  The underlying pattern is an interesting one.  Economists and 

policymakers have tended at first to view a decline in output as a cyclical shock to 

demand and to realize only gradually over time that a crisis has done substantial and 

lasting damage to the productive capacity of the economy.6  As a result, estimates of the 

gap between actual and potential output often narrow over time, partly through higher 

actual output but also through lower estimates of potential.  For example, figure 2 shows 

that the Congressional Budget Office has made a series of downward revisions to its 

estimates of potential output in recent years.7 

This supply-side damage has typically appeared both in the labor market and in 

the capital stock.8  Long spells of unemployment cause skills to atrophy and make it more 

difficult for workers to find new jobs, raising the natural rate of unemployment for those 

who do remain in the labor force and causing others to throw in the towel and drop out.  

Extended periods of weak demand appear to cause companies to invest less in plant and 

technology, which slows the growth of the productivity of the workforce.  The number of 

new business formations declines sharply, perhaps because of reduced credit availability, 

which may depress hiring, productivity, business innovation, and hence trend output.9  

6 For example, Martin, Munyan, and Wilson show that estimates of potential output generated by common 
filtering techniques tend to revise down following recessions as actual output grows slower than its pre-
recession trend; see Martin, Munyan, and Wilson, “Potential Output and Recessions,” in note 5.  In other 
words, looking backward with many years of hindsight at the evolution of output following a financial 
crisis, the negative effect on potential output is clearer than it is when estimating the level of potential 
output in real time immediately following the crises.  As an example of this type of exercise, see Furceri 
and Mourougane, “Effect of Financial Crises on Potential Output,” in note 5.

Corporate spending on research and development has also been strongly procyclical, 

which may have similar effects.10  

Turning to the recent U.S. experience, many economists now estimate that 

substantially more than half of the shortfall in gross domestic product relative to its pre-

crisis trend represents a reduction of potential output and not just a shortfall in demand.11  

U.S. labor force damage likely accounts for some part of the shortfall.12  The greater part 

appears to have resulted from lower trend labor productivity due to reduced capital 

investment and “multifactor productivity,” which is often thought of as capturing the 

effects of technological innovation.13  The employment rebound suggests that strong 

measures--such as those the Fed took during and after the crisis--can prevent even sharp 

job losses from becoming permanent.  But the productivity slowdown suggests that 

monetary policy cannot, by itself, avert all of the damage.

12 There is considerable debate about how much of the decline in the employment-to-population ratio and 
labor force participation has been due to the recession, how much of that decline is reversible, and, 
relatedly, how much of the decline would have occurred regardless in the absence of a recession.  For the 
argument that much of the decrease in labor force participation would likely have occurred even in the 
absence of the recession, see Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig,

likely reversible, see Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor Force Participation and

This consideration raises the question I mentioned a moment ago.  Should we 

think of this supply-side damage as permanent or temporary?  In many previous episodes 

around the world, post-crisis reductions in output have proved permanent.  Nonetheless, 

it seems plausible that at least part of the damage can be reversed.  As business 

confidence improves, employers may be more willing to take a chance on someone with 

an extended spell of unemployment.  A stronger job market and rising wages may 

encourage more potential workers to join the labor force.14  Over a longer period, 

stronger demand can produce higher capital investment, driving higher productivity.  A 

long expansion could also produce higher productivity as companies strive to get more 

out of every dollar of capital and hour of work and as the strong economy encourages 

entrepreneurship and innovation.   

To give us the best chance to recover lost ground, we need policies that support 

labor force participation, business and household confidence, hiring and investment, and 

productivity growth--policies, I hasten to add, that are, for the most part, outside the remit 

of the Federal Reserve.  Monetary policy also has a role to play by continuing to support 

the expansion as long as inflation expectations remain stable and realized inflation stays 

close to our 2 percent objective.  Indeed, in the current circumstances, accommodative 

policy may not only help restore some of our economy’s potential, but should also help 

return inflation to our 2 percent objective more expeditiously.   

There is no risk-free path for monetary policy.  The biggest risk of tightening too 

early or too fast is that the economy may weaken more than expected, forcing the central 

bank to reverse course.  The record of central banks lifting off from the zero lower bound 

14 In fact, as the recovery has progressed, the labor force participation rate and other broad indicators have 
moved back toward their longer-run trends.

suggests caution in this regard.  A second risk is that we could prematurely truncate the 

process of healing damage from the crisis, thereby ensuring that the admittedly severe 

cyclical effects become permanent. 

Overly accommodative monetary policy also poses risks.  First, the economy 

could overheat, and rising inflation could require the Committee to raise rates faster, 

which--if overdone--could produce a damaging recession.  For now, I would be more 

concerned with a second risk, which is that more-accommodative policy could lead to 

frothy financial conditions and eventually undermine financial stability.  While I do not 

see a troubling buildup of these risks today, tighter monetary policy might eventually be 

necessary if such risks do appear. 

Conclusion 

To wrap up, with the support of extraordinary monetary accommodation, our 

economy has made substantial progress.  As the FOMC moves to return monetary policy 

to a more normal footing, it makes sense to me to move fairly gradually as long as the 

incoming data evolve about as expected.  Doing so would, among other benefits, give our 

economy the best chance to make up lost ground.
