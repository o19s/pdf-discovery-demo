Strengthening the quantity and quality of capital held by banks has been a central element 

of post-financial crisis regulatory reform.  Yet, as the topic of this conference reminds us, the 

crisis also exposed weaknesses in other financial intermediaries that carried systemic 

implications.  In the United States, when Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers failed, they were so-

called freestanding investment banks, not subject even to the inadequate pre-crisis regulatory 

regime for bank holding companies.  The stress at American International Group (AIG), an 

insurance company, and the vulnerability of money market funds to destabilizing runs 

contributed to a profound deepening of the crisis.  Hence the theme for this session of the 

conference: In light of this recent history and, more generally, of the steady growth of nonbank 

financial intermediaries, to what degree should they be subject to the capital regulations 

developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and applied to bank holding 

companies in the United States and to all commercial and investment banks in Europe? 

 At first glance, the answer to this question might seem intuitively obvious.  After all, the 

risk of loss associated with a particular corporate loan or mortgage-backed security or, indeed, 

any other asset does not vary just because its legal owner is an insurance company or mutual 

fund, rather than a bank.  Yet we all know that regulatory capital requirements sometimes do 

vary with the nature of the firm.  And I suspect that most people in this room believe there are 

good reasons why they should vary under at least some circumstances.   

In my remarks this morning, I will explain how the identification of those circumstances 

should proceed--by looking not at the asset side of a financial intermediary’s balance sheet, but 

at the liability side.  The scope and nature of a firm’s liabilities provide the justifications for 

capital requirements regulation.  Differences in liabilities can, accordingly, sometimes warrant 

different capital requirements for portfolios of similar assets across firms.  At the risk of packing 



- 2 - 

too much into these introductory points, let me also note that an emphasis on a firm’s liabilities is 

related to, but not synonymous with, an emphasis on its activities.  Thus, for example, simply 

deciding that an intermediary provides mostly commercial banking services or insurance 

products does not fully answer the question of what its capital requirements should be. 

My purpose today is not to offer specific proposals, or even a comprehensive conceptual 

framework, but instead to propose an approach for thinking about the purposes of capital 

regulation across types of financial intermediaries that will suggest appropriate starting points for 

shaping--or reshaping--applicable capital regulation.  This seems to me a particularly important 

effort at a time when the financial system is undergoing significant change. 

Liability Structure and Capital Regulation 

 To begin, we should remind ourselves that capital regulation of private corporations is 

unusual.  Generally, market actors with actual or contemplated claims on a nonfinancial 

corporation are left to their own devices in protecting their interests, though various features of 

contract, securities, and insolvency law are designed to help them make these judgments more 

efficiently.  In many kinds of financial intermediaries, on the other hand, capital levels are 

regulated, usually because of market failures attributable to some combination of information 

problems, moral hazard, collective action problems, and systemic risk.  Scrutiny of the liability 

side of the balance sheet reveals whether and how these various justifications are present for 

different financial intermediaries.  Let me start with a couple of straightforward examples, well-

established in regulatory practice. 

 The first example arises from the fact that, by the very nature of their business, many 

intermediaries have substantially more customer-facing liabilities1 on their balance sheets than 

                                                 
1 By “customer facing liabilities,” I mean liabilities to households, retail investors, and businesses.  In financial 
intermediaries, these liabilities are not only greater than in similarly sized balance sheets of non-financial firms.

nonfinancial firms.  This characteristic often means that leverage is higher.  It almost always 

means that a large portion of the liability side of the balance sheet is accounted for by such 

customers, who are not well-positioned to evaluate the soundness of these intermediaries’ often-

opaque balance sheets.   

Consider the case of a very traditional life insurance company, which collects premiums 

from customers over a protracted period of time, while promising a payout to beneficiaries if the 

insured dies within the coverage period.  The duration of the exposure, difficulties in evaluating 

the company’s ability to pay, and the potentially high costs of changing coverage to another firm 

even if that evaluation can be done together provide a rationale for insurance company capital 

requirements.  Here the motivation for capital regulation is likely oriented toward the capacity of 

the company to meet these long-term claims as they come due, presumably over a fairly 

extended span.  Investors and counterparties from the financial sector might well be left to fend 

for themselves.  Thus this rationale for capital regulation focuses only on assuring sufficient 

assets over time to satisfy the policyholders’ claims should the company fail, with less attention 

to maintaining the company as a going concern. 

 A second example of how the liability side of an intermediary’s balance sheet suggests 

the appropriate form of capital regulation is presented by the familiar problem of deposit runs on 

banks.  Like a policyholder, a depositor has difficulty gauging the health of the financial 

intermediary.  But unlike a life insurance policyholder, a depositor can withdraw all or most of 

her funds if she has any fear--even an ill-founded fear--that the bank may be in trouble.  Indeed, 

depositors have a rational incentive to act quickly, since the first to withdraw will have the best 

chance of getting all their money back.  Experience with bank runs, and with the more-damaging 

                                                 
They also disproportionately arise from financial transactions – such as accepting deposits or investments – rather 
than for performance of services or delivery of goods.  



- 4 - 

cases of bank panics (in which problems at one bank are imputed to others on the basis of 

incomplete and possibly incorrect information), led to government-provided deposit insurance.  

While countering runs and panics and protecting depositors from loss, government deposit 

insurance creates different justifications for capital regulation--protecting the government 

insurance fund, which is now guaranteeing a significant portion of the bank’s liabilities, and 

countering moral hazard, which may arise because insured depositors need no longer care 

whether the bank is adequately capitalized. 

The moral hazard issue leads us to a third example of how the liability side of the balance 

sheet of a financial intermediary reveals the need for capital regulation--the too-big-to-fail 

(TBTF) problem.  As the size of an intermediary increases, its exposures to other market actors--

including many other intermediaries--may become so extensive that its failure would threaten the 

financial system as a whole.  Believing that the government will, for this reason, prevent such an 

intermediary from becoming insolvent, market actors may extend credit as if a guarantee similar 

to deposit insurance were in place.  Thus the nature and extent of the firm’s liabilities, taken as a 

whole, may warrant capital regulation to offset an implicit TBTF subsidy. 

Even if the distinct problem of TBTF could be countered through other means, such as a 

credible bankruptcy or resolution option, the failure of a financial intermediary with systemically 

significant liabilities raises the prospect of imposing very large negative externalities on the 

financial system.  This prospect creates an additional argument for capital requirements--or, 

more precisely, an argument for progressively higher capital requirements that would reduce the 

probability of the failure of the systemically important intermediary. 

Note that this last discussion has moved us toward consideration of macroprudential 

reasons for capital requirements--specifically, for higher requirements aimed at reducing the 



- 5 - 

probability of insolvency below that which would be warranted if the sole regulatory aim were to 

protect customers, depositors, or even a government deposit insurance fund.  As has been much 

discussed in recent years, pre-crisis financial regulatory regimes had substantially undervalued 

systemwide considerations.  Indeed, in the first instance the crisis spread not only because of the 

direct effects engendered by the insolvency of individual firms, but also because of the dramatic 

contraction of funding available throughout markets for widely held assets such as mortgage-

backed securities.  The pre-crisis explosion of short-term wholesale funding, both inside and 

outside traditional banks, left the entire financial system vulnerable to the disappearance of this 

market funding as real estate prices declined sharply and uncertainty spread about the value of 

the assets being funded.  Concerns about solvency accelerated the run of wholesale funding from 

Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, raising the prospect of classic fire sales of their assets, with 

consequent depressing effects on the balance sheets of all firms holding these assets. 

Experience during the financial crisis vindicated the view of those who had argued that 

liquidity, as well as capital, in large intermediaries needed to be regulated.2  It also buttressed the 

view that capital and liquidity regulation are closely related and need to be developed in tandem, 

if not as part of the same regulatory framework.  Much academic research prompted by the crisis 

has focused on the interrelationship between funding and solvency problems.3 

Here, then, is another way in which the characteristics of the liability side of an 

intermediary’s balance sheet should determine the form and stringency of capital regulation.

Shorter duration and, if you will, increased “runnability” of its liabilities create greater threats to 

both its stability and that of the financial system as a whole.  Where a firm is significantly 

dependent on this kind of funding, it may need more common equity to convince counterparties 

and investors of its solvency during periods in which assets are very volatile and to maintain its 

solvency should it need to sell assets at fire sale prices.  This microprudential basis for higher 

capital requirements is complemented by the macroprudential rationale that intermediaries whose 

deleveraging could have a broad impact on market liquidity through fire sale or related effects 

should be required to hold still more capital. 

Let me make three additional points on this rationale for higher capital standards.  First, a 

run that cuts off funding to widely held assets is a greater risk to the system than a conventional 

bank run in the absence of deposit insurance.  A bank’s whole loans would not usually be sold in 

great number even under stressed circumstances and, even to the degree they were, other banks’ 

portfolios of loans are generally not marked down because of the stressed bank’s sales.  Second, 

the possible availability of central bank liquidity support does not obviate the need for higher 

capital for intermediaries reliant on short-term wholesale funding.  The same factors that make 

market actors uncertain about the value of the intermediary’s assets in times of stress will be 

relevant to the central bank’s ability to assure itself that the recipient of temporary liquidity is in 

fact solvent.  Third, because these risks to the firm and the financial system arise from of the 

composition of the liability side of the balance sheet, the concerns expressed here apply--though 

perhaps in somewhat different degrees--regardless of the particular form of intermediation in 

which the firm is engaged.

Tailoring Capital Regulation 

 With only modest simplification of the always complex world of financial regulation, one 

can say that while capital requirements traditionally have differed significantly for different types 

of financial intermediaries, they have been relatively uniform for all firms classified as a 

particular type of intermediary.  As I mentioned at the outset, the variations in capital 

requirements might run contrary to the intuition that the risk of loss of a given portfolio of assets 

is the same no matter who owns them.  Of course, the direct explanation for the variations lies in 

part in institutional history, with different regulatory bodies having been given authority over 

different types of financial intermediaries.  Still, as we have seen, differences in the liability side 

of the balance sheet can in fact provide a good policy justification for having varying capital 

requirements among different types of financial intermediaries.   

Yet, as I will suggest in a moment, even if conventional differences are at least broadly 

justifiable (which, of course, is not to say that certain differences in any particular jurisdiction 

have been well-formulated in all their specifics), the fact that so many intermediaries have 

moved well beyond their traditional practices, products, and scope may warrant some 

qualification of conventional practice.  Conversely, the conventional regulatory principle of 

imposing more or less uniform capital requirements on a given form of intermediary might have 

seemed intuitively correct.  But one lesson regulators around the world have drawn from the 

crisis is that macroprudential considerations can sometimes argue for varying capital 

requirements among the same kind of intermediaries.   

 Let me address, then, some implications of the liability-side perspective on capital 

requirements for different forms of financial intermediaries.  Despite the focus of this session of 

the conference on nonbanks, I want to begin by noting how post-crisis changes in the Basel 



- 8 - 

regime reflected the characteristics of an intermediary’s liabilities.  Prior to the crisis, the Basel 

regime--though nominally applicable only to internationally active banks--in fact applied to most 

banks in many member jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union (EU).  

There were no quantitative liquidity requirements, and capital requirements did not vary based 

on the liability side of the balance sheet.  Indeed, the major departure from uniform application 

of capital rules was the opportunity afforded by Basel II for large banks to use their own internal 

models in determining their regulatory capital requirements, an opportunity that Basel II’s 

proponents expected to result in slightly lower requirements than under a standardized approach. 

 In the wake of the crisis, Basel III strengthened capital quality and levels across the 

board.  In addition, capital surcharges were imposed on about thirty banks of global systemic 

importance (G-SIBs), based on criteria that roughly reflect TBTF concerns--that is, the size and 

interconnectedness of the firms’ balance sheets.  Neither the generally applicable Basel III 

changes nor the G-SIB surcharges were specifically tied to the stability of a bank’s debt 

structure.  However, minimum quantitative liquidity requirements have been developed in the 

form of the shorter-horizon Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the longer-horizon Net Stable 

Funding Ratio, which together are intended to place some limits on excessive reliance on 

runnable liabilities.4 

 Important as these changes have been, the risks to the financial system posed by large 

amounts of short-term wholesale funding argue for closer regulatory linkage between capital and 

                                                 
4  In the United States, we have also applied a somewhat less stringent version of the LCR to banks that are large but 
that do not cross the threshold of being internationally active.  This tiered approach is consistent with the principle 
stated earlier that prudential requirements should vary based on the potential impact of a firm’s failure on the 
financial system as a whole. 

The liquidity rules clearly seem to have influenced the way banks manage their balance sheets.  In the 
United States, bank holding companies subject to the LCR significantly increased their holdings of high-quality 
liquid assets from the beginning of 2013 until the beginning of this year, to the point that many internationally active 
banks reported their LCR ratios already above fully phased-in requirements, even though the transition rules set an 
80 percent minimum ratio for January 1, 2015.

liquidity concerns.  Conceptually, the cleanest approach might be to integrate capital and 

liquidity requirements in a single regulatory framework, which would establish minimum levels 

of capital and liquidity and then increase the capital requirement for intermediaries with more 

vulnerable funding structures.  Higher capital levels would be especially warranted for 

intermediaries using large enough amounts of short-term debt that their response when funding 

liquidity is constrained--either selling assets or withholding funding from their own customers--

could adversely affect the financial system as a whole.   

Realistically, though, the goal of full integration of capital and liquidity regulation seems 

unattainable for the foreseeable future.  For one thing, it is hard to imagine all the relevant 

banking, market, and insurance regulators converging on such a novel approach anytime soon.  

In addition, though, without a more complete understanding of the precise relationship between 

liquidity and capital needs, placing so much weight on one form of regulation would be ill-

advised.  For the present, then, the Basel regime will maintain separate capital and liquidity 

regulations, which may differ among types of financial intermediaries.5  But we can at least 

strive to establish each set of regulations with reference to the other and to attain at least a rough 

consistency across regulatory regimes applicable to various intermediaries. 

In the United States, we have already taken one step in this direction.  As you may know, 

in implementing the Basel G-SIB capital surcharge, we decided that surcharges somewhat higher 

than those finally agreed in Basel were appropriate.  As we refashioned the Basel approach, we 

added a metric on short-term wholesale funding dependence to the formula for determining a 

                                                 
5 It is worth noting that the net capital rule for broker-dealers maintained by the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission is a form of hybrid capital and liquidity regulation.  However, it seems basically oriented to protecting 
customers, a bit like traditional regulation of life insurance companies, and was not developed with going concern or 
systemic implications in mind.  It does not, for instance, place higher requirements on firms with heavy reliance on 
short-term wholesale funding, though it does penalize firms that hold large amounts of illiquid assets.  In many 
respects the rule seems well-suited to smaller broker-dealers but, for reasons explained earlier, it does not seem 
optimal for the large broker-dealers in large bank holding companies.

firm’s systemic significance, a factor that unfortunately had not been included in Basel.  I hope 

that when it comes time for a review of the Basel methodology for identifying and grouping G-

SIBs, funding practices and vulnerabilities will receive more attention.  And there may be further 

steps that could increase that sensitivity.  Exploring ideas along these lines seems to me far 

preferable to raising minimum liquidity requirements for all banks, even those with capital levels 

well above the regulatory minimum.  For example, while stress testing has traditionally focused 

on risks to capital, some observers have suggested adding liquidity risks to the stress test. 

 Turning now to some implications for other intermediaries, I will begin with broker-

dealers, which pose perhaps the clearest case of the capital/funding relationship.  Broker-dealers 

tend to hold large amounts of assets that are of longer duration, but that also are relatively liquid 

in normal times (in contrast, say, to whole loans by a bank).  However, as seen most graphically 

in the case of mortgage-backed securities during the crisis, many of these assets can rapidly 

become quite illiquid in periods of stress.  Since broker-dealers generally fund substantial 

portions of these assets with short-term liabilities, such as repurchase agreements (repos) rather 

than insured deposits, there is the potential, again seen in the crisis, for runs reminiscent of the 

bank runs of the era before the advent of deposit insurance.   

To a considerable extent, of course, the Basel framework covers these firms.  In the EU, 

any broker-dealer is covered, whether as a stand-alone entity or as part of a universal bank.  In 

the pre-crisis period in the United States, matters were less clear, since only broker-dealers 

affiliated with bank holding companies were covered by the full panoply of Basel requirements.  

There was partial coverage of the five largest freestanding broker-dealers that needed such 

oversight in order to operate within the EU.  Because, during the crisis, those five firms either 

became bank holding companies or failed and had their continuing operations absorbed by bank 



- 11 - 

holding companies, all sizeable domestically owned broker-dealers are now covered by Basel 

requirements.   

 However, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the Basel framework itself has not gone as 

far as is desirable in making capital requirements at the largest institutions sensitive to 

macroprudential funding concerns, a circumstance underscored by the balance sheets typical of 

broker-dealers.  Consideration of changes such as refinement of the formula for assigning 

surcharges to G-SIBs would be useful when Basel standards are revisited over time.  In the 

interim, there are more near-term opportunities for supervisory measures that take account of the 

relationship between capital levels and funding vulnerabilities.   

 Perhaps the most interesting application of a liability-side focus on capital regulation is 

the case of insurance companies.  Given the ongoing discussions of capital standards in the 

International Association of Insurance Supervisors, the issue is also a timely one.  Several 

relevant points can be derived from attention to the liability side of insurance company balance 

sheets. 

 First, as shown in my earlier example of how liability structure affects capital needs, the 

largest segment of a traditional insurance company’s liabilities is composed of contingent claims 

based on the occurrence of specified events, such as the death of an insured person or destruction 

of insured property.  These claims cannot be accelerated at the discretion of the holders of the 

contracts so, unlike deposits in a bank, these liabilities cannot run in any meaningful sense.  

Unless customers decide to sever their relationship with the company, in which case the 

contingent liability will be reduced or eliminated, they will continue to provide funding to the 

firm.  Life insurance, in particular, has an unusually predictable liability pattern, well-refined by 

actuaries over the years.  Thus there is a relative absence of liquidity risk as compared with other 



- 12 - 

kinds of intermediaries.  Property and casualty insurance is somewhat more volatile but that 

volatility is not correlated with the broader economy.  So, while higher capital levels may be 

needed for microprudential purposes, the traditional property-casualty insurance model does not 

appear to raise significant funding, fire sale, or other macroprudential concerns. 

 These traditional insurance liabilities argue for lower capital requirements than might be 

required for a hypothetical bank holding a similar portfolio of assets.  And, as noted earlier, in 

some respects they also argue for a gone-concern approach to capital regulation.  However, a 

second observation is that the liability side of the balance sheets of many large insurance 

companies look quite different from this traditional picture.  Many life insurers, for example, 

now offer wealth and retirement products with account values that can be withdrawn at the 

discretion of the policyholder, sometimes with little or no surrender penalty.  Although these 

products are generally considered medium to long-term liabilities, the option to surrender or 

withdraw funds creates the potential for increased claims that could strain the liquidity of the 

firm.  Recent history suggests that the surrender rates of fixed annuities are directly related to the 

path of interest rate rises.  In the middle part of the last decade, as interest rates rose in the United 

States, the surrender rate for these products increased by about 75 percent in just a few years, 

before dropping precipitously after the rapid decline in rates following the onset of the financial 

crisis. 

 Similarly, the move of some insurance firms into securities lending, repo, over-the-

counter derivatives, and other capital market activities can work significant changes in the 

balance sheets of those firms, creating tighter connections to the rest of the financial system.  As 

with other financial intermediaries, insurers then become subject to demands for posting 

additional collateral or closing out positions as unfavorable market conditions take hold.  In 



- 13 - 

addition, if the books of the insurance company are large enough, it then becomes a potential 

vehicle for transmitting distress at the company to other parts of the financial system. 

 Thus the liability side of the balance sheets of firms that are all “insurance companies” 

can vary substantially, just as with firms that are called “banks” or “bank holding companies.”  

Yet capital regulation currently applicable to insurance companies seems not to make some of 

the relevant distinctions.  Traditional capital regulation, with an implicit aim of protecting only 

conventional policyholders over time, potentially through an orderly insolvency, does not reflect 

the balance sheet risks I have just described.  Yet more recent measures, such as Solvency II, 

with its heavy emphasis on current market valuation, may not take account of the fact that 

liability and liquidity risks for genuinely traditional life insurance products are relatively limited 

compared to those of many other intermediaries.  In some respects, Solvency II ignores the 

strength of conventional insurance funding--that assets can be held for the truly long-term, 

through multiple business cycles--even as it focuses directly on the fluctuations in asset values 

that are indeed relevant to many less conventional activities. 

This brief review illustrates the challenges in fashioning capital requirements for large 

insurance companies with a mix of traditional, nontraditional, and noninsurance activities that 

are sometimes quite intertwined in particular business lines or subsidiaries.  And, even where 

these activities are reasonably segregated from one another, some of the policy devices suggested 

for differential capital treatment may be misplaced.  For example, deciding on higher capital 

requirements based solely on whether an activity is “nontraditional” for an insurance company 

can be inappropriate.  A “nontraditional” activity for an insurance company could embrace 

everything from the massive derivatives business maintained by the pre-crisis AIG to very sedate 

businesses outside the financial sphere entirely.  In confronting these and similar challenges, I 



- 14 - 

would suggest that a focus on the actual nature of liabilities associated with a firm’s activities 

provides a good starting point for sound analysis. 

 Finally, let me mention asset managers briefly.  As they have garnered increasing shares 

of financial system assets, a trend that accelerated following the financial crisis, the question has 

arisen whether they too should hold capital buffers.  Of course in most cases the asset manager 

itself does not have much of a balance sheet at all.  The funds themselves are often not leveraged, 

in which case nearly all the liabilities are shares of the fund held by investors, the price of which 

varies to reflect the value of the assets purchased by the manager of the fund.6   

While some commentators have suggested that liquidity challenges and consequent fire 

sale type behavior might develop if the structure of the fund places a premium on exiting first, 

these kinds of risks would support an argument less for capital buffers than for some form of 

prudential market regulation, such as rules on liquidity or redemptions.  I would note in this 

regard that last week the SEC issued a proposed rulemaking that would require open-ended funds 

to have liquidity risk management controls in place for shareholder redemptions, including 

during times of stress.7  Likewise, to the degree that certain idiosyncratic risks might exist with 

respect to the decisions and operations of certain asset managers, their liability structure again 

suggests that some form of prudential market regulation would be better suited to address these 

risks. 

                                                 
6 Through the use of certain kinds of derivatives, some funds acquire synthetic leverage.  There are arguments for 
additional regulation in those cases, though again, capital requirements do not seem at first glance the optimal tool. 
7 Under the proposed rules, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds would be required to implement liquidity risk 
management programs to address investor redemptions, including swing pricing during times of rapid redemption 
and calculation requirements to measure the amount of assets that could be liquidated without impacting market 
prices.  Securities and Exchange Commission Press Release 2015-201, SEC Proposes Liquidity Management Rules

Conclusion 

 In conclusion, let me recapitulate one set of points and add another.  To recapitulate--

focusing on the characteristics of the liability side of a financial intermediary’s balance sheet 

suggests that there are reasons to vary capital regulation across different forms of financial 

intermediation, but that significant shifts in the nature and scope of an intermediary’s liabilities 

may in turn provide reasons for varying applicable capital regulation among firms that are 

primarily identified as a particular type of intermediary.  Conceptual, institutional, and practical 

impediments to developing a single framework for capital regulation are doubtlessly insuperable 

for the foreseeable future.  But regulators with mandates covering different kinds of 

intermediaries, including the Federal Reserve, must keep both sides of this perspective in mind.  

And, hopefully, regulators with a more focused responsibility will be sensitive to the ways in 

which their regulated entities have departed from their original liability structure. 

 The additional point follows from the first.  When concerns are raised about regulatory 

arbitrage or a level playing field, they are usually in the context of a similar asset being held, or a 

business activity conducted, by financial firms with different regulatory structures.  My 

discussion today would suggest that attention must be paid to the liability structure of the 

different firms before deciding whether the asymmetric regulatory treatment is prudent or an 

invitation to the propagation of new financial risks. 

 These two points underscore the fact that the question for regulators is not really whether 

capital rules developed for banks should be extended to nonbank actors.  The Basel standards 

have already evolved to take account of different forms of intermediation in the financial firms 

subject to those rules.  The Basel framework might itself be enhanced by further differentiation 



- 16 - 

of capital and liquidity requirements based on the liability structures of firms.  Similarly, capital 

rules for intermediaries not subject to Basel rules should be shaped by similar considerations.
