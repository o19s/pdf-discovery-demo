“Energy Transition:  Strategies for a New World” 
35th Annual IHS CERAWeek 

 
Houston, Texas 


February 23, 2016 
 



I would like to thank Daniel Yergin for his kind invitation to speak this evening at 

the CERAWeek conference.  The energy industry--more precisely, the price of oil--is on 

the minds of almost everyone these days, and this conference is addressing many 

important issues.  I am a macroeconomist, and do not plan on focusing tonight on 

developments in the energy sector.  But from time to time the price of oil becomes a 

macroeconomic issue, and this is one of those times.  So I have been listening intently to 

the many experts who have already spoken here today, and look forward to the discussion 

that will follow this speech, in the belief that I will emerge with a better understanding of 

recent and future developments in the industry.   

To get things started, I thought I could provide some background on recent 

monetary policy decisions.1   

As you all know, at our December meeting the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage 

point, to 1/4 to 1/2 percent.2  At our meeting in January, we decided to maintain that 

range.  The increase in December came after seven years during which the FOMC had 

kept the federal funds rate between 0 and 25 basis points.  This ultra-low rate was in 

keeping with our congressional mandate to pursue a monetary policy that fosters 

maximum employment and price stability, which we define as 2 percent inflation.   

Our decision in December was based on the substantial improvement in the labor 

market and the Committee’s confidence that inflation would return to our 2 percent goal

over the medium term.  Employment growth last year averaged a solid 230,000 per 

month, and the unemployment rate declined from 5.6 percent to 5.0 percent over the 

course of 2015--and declined further to 4.9 percent last month.  This is close to the 

unemployment rate generally regarded as the full employment rate of unemployment.  

Inflation ran well below our target last year, held down by the transitory effects of 

declines in crude oil prices and also in the prices of non-oil imports.  Prices for these 

goods have fallen further and as you all know, for longer than expected.  Once these oil 

and import prices stop falling and level out, their effects on inflation will dissipate, which 

is the main reason we expect that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term, 

supported by a further strengthening in labor market conditions. 

Of course, with the federal funds target now at between 25 and 50 basis points, 

and the effective federal funds rate currently almost at the center of that target range, our 

monetary policy remains accommodative.  And, at the time of our January decision, my 

colleagues and I anticipated that economic conditions would evolve in a manner 

warranting only gradual increases in the federal funds rate, and that the federal funds rate 

would likely remain, for some time, below the levels that we expect to prevail in the 

longer run.  I should emphasize, however, that that was an expectation, not a decision, 

and our future policy actions are by no means predetermined. 

During the years in which we held the federal funds rate near zero, the Federal 

Reserve also engaged in large-scale asset purchases to further ease financial conditions 

and promote economic recovery.  Consequently, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet 

grew from less than $1 trillion in mid-2008 to $4.5 trillion by late 2014.  As a result of 

the size of our balance sheet, the FOMC is employing new tools to implement monetary 


 - 3 - 

policy.  In particular, to raise the federal funds rate we increased the interest rate we pay 

on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at the Federal Reserve.  We also 

employed an overnight reverse repurchase facility, through which we interact with a 

broad range of firms to help provide a soft floor for the federal funds rate consistent with 

our target range.3  These new tools have worked well, and the federal funds rate and other 

short-term interest rates have increased as expected.  We will continue to monitor these 

markets closely, and we can make adjustments to our tools if necessary to maintain 

control over money market rates.  

The economic data that have come in since our December interest rate decision 

suggest that the labor market has continued to improve.  Although job gains slowed some 

last month, over the most recent three months payrolls have increased 230,000 jobs per 

month on average, as the unemployment rate declined.  Moreover, the spending 

indicators that we have in hand for January point to a pickup in economic growth this 

quarter.  Further, the 12-month change in average hourly earnings has moved up in recent 

months and stood at 2-1/2 percent in January.  In addition, the rate of core consumer price 

index inflation over the past 12 months exceeded 2 percent, though this was not true of 

the core price index of personal consumption expenditures that the Fed monitors closely.  

However--and there is frequently a “however” in our business--further declines in oil 

prices suggest that total inflation will likely remain low for somewhat longer than had 

been previously expected before moving back to 2 percent.   

In addition, global financial markets have been unusually volatile since the turn of 

the year.  For instance, the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX) rose markedly in early

January, though it remains below the levels it reached in August of last year and in 2011, 

and it last week declined below its average value since the start of the year.  The large 

movements in asset prices likely reflect increased concern about the global outlook, 

particularly ongoing developments in China and the effects of the declines in the prices of 

oil and other commodities on commodity-exporting nations.  Asset price declines may 

also reflect a reassessment of the prospects for growth in Europe and Japan, and perhaps 

also a recognition that U.S. gross domestic product and productivity growth have 

remained stubbornly low.    

If the recent financial market developments lead to a sustained tightening of 

financial conditions, they could signal a slowing in the global economy that could affect 

growth and inflation in the United States.  But we have seen similar periods of volatility 

in recent years--including in the second half of 2011--that have left little visible imprint 

on the economy, and it is still early to judge the ramifications of the increased market 

volatility of the first seven weeks of 2016.  As Chair Yellen said in her testimony to the 

Congress two weeks ago, while “global financial developments could produce a slowing 

in the economy, I think we want to be careful not to jump to a premature conclusion 

about what is in store for the U.S. economy.”  Of course, the FOMC is closely monitoring 

global economic and financial developments and assessing their implications for the 

labor market and inflation and the balance of risks to the outlook. 

Now, with our next FOMC meeting just three weeks away, I expect most of you 

are less interested in what we did at our previous meetings, and more interested in what 

we are going to do at the next one.  I can’t answer that question because, as I have 

emphasized in the past, we simply do not know. The world is an uncertain place--


 - 5 - 

sometimes more uncertain than at other times--and all monetary policymakers can really 

be sure of is that what will happen is often different from what we currently expect.  That 

is why the Committee has indicated that its policy decisions will be data dependent, 

which is to say that we will adjust policy appropriately in light of economic and financial 

events to best foster conditions consistent with the attainment of our employment and 

inflation objectives.   

As you know, in making our policy decisions, my FOMC colleagues and I spend 

considerable time assessing the incoming economic and financial information and its 

implications for the economic outlook.  But we must also consider some other issues, two 

of which I would like to mention briefly today.   

First, most estimates of the full employment rate of unemployment are close to 

5 percent.  The actual rate of unemployment is now slightly below 5 percent, and the 

median view of the members of the FOMC is that it will decline further, perhaps even to 

the vicinity of 4.7 percent.  The question is, should we be concerned about that 

possibility?  In my view, a modest overshoot of this sort would be appropriate in current 

circumstances for two reasons.  The first reason is that other measures of labor market 

conditions--such as the fraction of workers with part-time employment who would prefer 

to work full time and the number of people not actively looking for work who would like 

to work--indicate that more slack may remain in the labor market than the unemployment 

rate alone would suggest.  And the second reason is that with inflation currently well 

below 2 percent, a modest overshoot could actually be helpful in moving inflation back to 

2 percent more rapidly.  Nonetheless, a persistent large overshoot of our employment 

mandate would risk an undesirable rise in inflation that might require a relatively abrupt 


 - 6 - 

policy tightening, which could inadvertently push the economy into recession.  Monetary 

policy should aim to avoid such risks and keep the expansion on a sustainable track.   

The second issue is how best to integrate balance sheet policy with interest rate 

policy.  The FOMC has indicated that the Federal Reserve will, in the longer run, hold no 

more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively--

which will require us to reduce the size of our balance sheet substantially.  But that 

statement leaves open the question of when we should begin that process.  Because the 

tools I mentioned earlier--the payment of interest on reserve balances and the overnight 

reverse repurchase facility--can be used to raise the federal funds rate independent of the 

size of the balance sheet, we have the flexibility to adjust the size of our balance sheet at 

the appropriate time.  With the federal funds rate still quite low and expected to rise only 

gradually, there is some benefit to maintaining a larger balance sheet for a time.  Doing 

so should help support accommodative financial conditions and so reduce the risks to the 

economy in the event of an adverse shock.  Consistent with this view, the Committee has 

decided to continue to reinvest principal payments from its securities portfolio until 

normalization of the federal funds rate is well under way.  The decision about when to 

cease or begin phasing out reinvestment will depend on how economic and financial 

conditions and the economic outlook evolve.4   

With that background, I thank you for listening, and look forward to continuing 

the discussion, initially with Dan Yergin.
