A View from the Federal Reserve Board:  The Mortgage Market and Housing Conditions 



Remarks by 


Elizabeth A. Duke 


Member 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


Housing Policy Executive Council 


Washington, D.C. 








May 9, 2013 





Since joining the Board in 2008 amid a crisis centered on mortgage lending, I 

have focused much of my attention on housing and mortgage markets, issues surrounding 

foreclosures, and neighborhood stabilization.  In March of this year, I laid out my 

thoughts on current conditions in the housing and mortgage markets in a speech to the 

Mortgage Bankers Association.
1
  Today I will summarize and update that information 

with a focus on mortgage credit conditions.  Before I proceed, I should note that the 

views I express are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Board of 

Governors or the Federal Open Market Committee. 

A sustained recovery in the housing market appears to be under way.  House 

prices, as measured by a variety of national indexes, have risen 6 to 11 percent since the 

beginning of 2012 (figure 1).
2
  The recovery of house prices has been broad based 

geographically, with 90 percent of local markets having experienced price gains over the 

year ending in February.  Also since the beginning of 2012, housing starts and permits 

have risen by nearly 30 percent (figure 2), while new and existing home sales have also 

seen double-digit growth rates.  Homebuilder sentiment has improved notably, and real 

estate agents report stronger traffic of people shopping for homes (figure 3).
3
  In national 

surveys, households report that low interest rates and house prices make it a good time to

buy a home; they also appear more certain that house price gains will continue (figure

Despite the recent gains, the level of housing market activity remains 

low.  Existing home sales are currently at levels in line with those seen in the late 1990s, 

while single-family starts and permits are at levels commensurate with the early 

1990s.  And applications for home-purchase mortgages, as measured by the Mortgage 

Bankers Association index, were at a level in line with that of the mid-1990s 

(figure 5).  The subdued level of mortgage purchase originations is particularly striking 

given the record low mortgage rates that have prevailed in recent years. 

The drop in originations has been most pronounced among borrowers with lower 

credit scores.  For example, between 2007 and 2012, originations of prime purchase 

mortgages fell about 30 percent for borrowers with credit scores greater than 780, 

compared with a drop of about 90 percent for borrowers with credit scores between 

620 and 680 (figure 6).
5
  Originations are virtually nonexistent for borrowers with credit 

scores below 620.  The distribution of credit scores in these purchase origination data 

tells the same story in a different way:  The median credit score on these originations rose 

from 730 in 2007 to 770 in 2013, whereas scores for mortgages at the 10th percentile rose 

from 640 to 690 (figure 7).   

Many borrowers who have faced difficulty in obtaining prime mortgages have 

turned to mortgages insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA),

 Household reports are from staff calculations based on results of the Thomson Reuters/University of 

Michigan Surveys of Consumers.

 These calculations are based on data provided by McDash Analytics, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of 

Lender Processing Services, Inc.  The underlying data are provided by mortgage servicers.  These servicers 

classify loans as “prime,” “subprime,” or “FHA.”  Prime loans include those eligible for sale to the 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) as well as those with favorable credit characteristics but loan 

sizes that exceed the GSE guidelines (“jumbo” loans).

the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), or the Rural Housing Service (RHS).  

Data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act indicate that the share of 

purchase mortgages guaranteed or insured by the FHA, the VA, or the RHS rose from 5 

percent in 2006 to more than 40 percent in 2011 (figure 8).
6
  But here, too, loan 

originations appear to have contracted for borrowers with low credit scores.  The median 

credit score on FHA purchase originations increased from 625 in 2007 to 690 in 2013, 

while the 10th percentile has increased from 550 to 650 (figure 9).
7 


Part of the contraction in loan originations to households with lower credit scores 

may reflect weak demand among these potential homebuyers.  Although we have little 

data on this point, it may be the case that such households suffered disproportionately 

from the sharp rise in unemployment during the recession and thus have not been in a 

financial position to purchase a home. 

There is evidence that tight mortgage lending conditions may also be a factor in 

the contraction in originations.  Data from lender rate quotes suggest that almost all 

lenders have been offering quotes (through the daily “rate sheets” provided to mortgage 

brokers) on mortgages eligible for sale to the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) 

to borrowers with credit scores of 750 over the past two years.

  Most lenders have been

 Staff calculations suggest that the FHA and VA market share dipped a bit in 2012 but remained quite 

elevated.  These calculations are based on data provided by McDash Analytics, LLC, a wholly owned 

subsidiary of Lender Processing Services, Inc. 
7
 The shift in the distributions may partly reflect changes in the FHA’s underwriting guidelines.  In 2010, 

the FHA required a minimum credit score of 580 in order to qualify for a loan with a 3.5 percent down 

payment.  In 2013, the FHA required manual underwriting for loans with a credit score less than 620 and a 

debt-to-income ratio greater than 43 percent.  See U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 

(2010), “FHA Announces Policy Changes to Address Risk and Strengthen Finances,” press release, 

January 20, 

http://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/press/press_releases_media_advisories/2010/HUDNo.10-016;

willing to offer quotes to borrowers with credit scores of 680 as well.  Fewer than two-

thirds of lenders, though, are willing to extend mortgage offers to consumers with credit 

scores of 620 (figure 10).
9
  And this statistic may overstate the availability of credit to 

borrowers with lower credit scores:  The rates on many of these offers might be 

unattractive, and borrowers whose credit scores indicate eligibility may not meet other 

aspects of the underwriting criteria. 

Tight credit conditions also appear to be part of the story for FHA-insured loans.  

In the Federal Reserve’s October 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 

Lending Practices (SLOOS), one-half to two-thirds of respondents indicated that they 

were less likely than in 2006 to originate an FHA loan to a borrower with a credit score 

of 580 or 620 (figure 11).  Standards have tightened a bit further since:  In the April 2013 

SLOOS, about 30 percent of lenders reported that they were less likely than a year ago to 

originate FHA mortgages to borrowers with a credit score of 580 or 620 (figure 12).
10


The April SLOOS offers some clues about why mortgage credit is so tight for 

borrowers with lower credit scores.  Banks participating in the survey identified a 

familiar assortment of factors as damping their willingness to extend any type of loan to 

these borrowers:  the risk that lenders will be required to repurchase defaulted loans from 

the GSEs (“putback” risk), the outlook for house prices and economic activity, capacity 

constraints, the risk-adjusted opportunity cost of such loans, servicing costs, balance 

                                                 
9
 These data series begin in 2009 and 2010, so we cannot compare the current level of rate quotes to those 

that prevailed before the financial crisis.  However, in response to a special question on the Federal 

Reserve’s April 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, nearly 85 percent of 

lenders reported that they were somewhat or much less likely than in 2006 to originate a mortgage to a 

borrower with a credit score of 620 and a down payment of 10 percent (see 

www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey/201205/default.htm).  This response suggests that credit 

supply has contracted for such borrowers.

sheet or warehousing capacity, guarantee fees charged by the GSEs, borrowers’ ability to 

obtain private mortgage insurance or second liens, and investor appetite for private-label 

mortgage securitizations.  Respondents appeared to put particular weight on GSE 

putbacks, the economic outlook, and the risk-adjusted opportunity cost.  In addition, 

several large banks cited capacity constraints and borrowers’ difficulties in obtaining 

private mortgage insurance or second liens as at least somewhat important factors in 

restraining their willingness to approve such loans. 

Over time, some of these factors should exert less of a drag on mortgage credit 

availability.  For example, as the economic and housing market recovery continues, 

lenders should gain confidence that mortgage loans will perform well, and they should 

expand their lending accordingly. 

Capacity constraints will likely also ease.  Refinancing applications have 

expanded much more over the past year and a half than lenders’ ability to process these 

loans.  For example, one measure of capacity constraints--the number of real estate credit 

employees--has only edged up over this period (figure 13).  When capacity constraints 

are binding, lenders may prioritize the processing of easier-to-complete or more 

profitable loan applications.  Indeed, preliminary research by the Board’s staff suggests 

that the increase in the refinance workload during the past 18 months appears to have 

been associated with a 25 to 35 percent decrease in purchase originations among 

borrowers with credit scores between 620 and 680 and a 10 to 15 percent decrease among 

borrowers with credit scores between 680 and 710.
11

  Any such crowding-out effect 

should start to unwind as the current refinancing boom decelerates. 

                                                 
11

 These estimates are smaller than the estimates in the March 2013 Mortgage Bankers Association speech 

because capacity constraints appear to have become less severe in recent months (see Duke, “Comments on 


 - 6 - 

Other factors holding back mortgage credit, however, may be slower to unwind.  

As the SLOOS results indicate, lenders remain concerned about putback risk.  The ability 

to hold lenders accountable for poorly underwritten loans is a significant protection for 

taxpayers.  However, if lenders are unsure about the conditions under which they will be 

required to repurchase loans sold to the GSEs, they may shy away from originating loans 

to borrowers whose risk profiles indicate a higher likelihood of default.  The Federal 

Housing Finance Agency launched an important initiative last year to clarify the 

liabilities associated with representations and warranties, but, so far, putback risk appears 

to still weigh on the mortgage market. 

Mortgage servicing standards, particularly for delinquent loans, are more stringent 

than in the past due to settlement actions and consent orders.  Servicing rules recently 

released by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) will extend many of these 

standards to all lenders.
12

  These standards remedy past abuses and provide important 

protections to borrowers, but also increase the cost of servicing nonperforming loans.  

This issue is compounded by current servicing compensation arrangements under which 

servicers receive the same fee for the routine processing of current loans as they do for 

the more expensive processing of delinquent loans.  This model--especially in 

conjunction with higher default-servicing costs--gives lenders an incentive to avoid 

originating loans to borrowers who are more likely to default.  A change to servicer 

compensation models for delinquent loans could alleviate some of these concerns. 

                                                                                                                                                 
Housing and Mortgage Markets,” in note 1).  These estimates are for the period from February 2011 to 

February 2013.  The March estimates were for the period from October 2010 to October 2012.

Government regulations will also affect the cost of mortgage credit.  In January, 

the CFPB released rules, in addition to those for servicing standards, on ability-to-repay 

requirements, the definition of a qualified mortgage (QM), and loan originator 

compensation.
13

  The Federal Reserve and other agencies are in the process of moving 

forward on proposed rulemakings that would implement revised regulatory capital 

requirements and the requirements for risk retention mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which include an exemption for 

mortgages that meet the definition of qualified residential mortgages (QRM). 

As the regulatory capital and risk retention requirements are still under 

deliberation, I won’t comment on these regulations today.  However, I will share a few 

thoughts on the possible effects of the QM rulemaking on access to credit. 

As background, the QM rule is part of a larger ability-to-repay rulemaking that 

requires lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination that the borrower can 

repay the loan.  The rulemaking addresses the lax underwriting practices that flourished 

during the housing boom by setting minimum underwriting standards and by providing 

borrowers with protections against lending abuses.  In particular, borrowers can sue the 

lender for violations of the ability-to-repay rules and claim monetary damages.  If the 

original lender sells or securitizes the loan, the borrower can claim these damages at any 

time in a foreclosure action taken by the lender or any assignee.  If the mortgage meets 

                                                 
13

 For more on ability-to-repay requirements and the definition of a QM, see CFPB (2013), “Ability to 

Repay and Qualified Mortgage Standards under the Truth in Lending Act (Regulation Z),” Regulations:  

Final Rules Issued by the CFPB 2013, webpage, January 10,

originator-compensation-requirements-under-the-truth-in-lending-act-regulation-z.

the QM standard, however, the lender receives greater protection from such potential 

lawsuits because it is presumed that the borrower had the ability to repay the loan.   

Loans that fall outside the QM standard may be more costly to originate than 

loans that meet the standard for at least four reasons, all else being equal.  The first 

reason is the possible increase in foreclosure losses and litigation costs.  Although these 

costs, in the aggregate, are expected to be small, their full extent will not be known until 

the courts settle any ability-to-repay suits that may be brought forward.
14

  The second 

reason is that mortgages that do not meet the QM definition will also not qualify as 

QRMs, so lenders will be required to hold some of the risk if these loans are securitized.
15 


The third reason is that loan originators will have better information than investors on the 

quality of the underwriting decision.  Investors may demand a premium to compensate 

them for the concern that originators might sell them the loans most vulnerable to ability-

to-repay lawsuits.  The fourth reason is that the non-QM market, at least initially, may be 

small and illiquid, which would increase the cost of these loans. 

The higher costs associated with non-QM loans should have very little effect on 

access to credit in the near term because almost all current mortgage originations meet 

the QM standard.  The vast majority of current originations are eligible to be purchased, 

insured, or guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the FHA, the VA, or the RHS.  

                                                 
14

 The CFPB estimates of these costs are available at www.federalregister.gov/articles/2013/01/30/2013-

00736/ability-to-repay-and-qualified-mortgage-standards-under-the-truth-in-lending-act-regulation-z#h-

201, section VII.E.3. 
15

 If a mortgage-backed security is collateralized by “qualified residential mortgages,” as defined by federal 

regulators consistent with section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the securitizer is not required to retain any 

risk in the securitization transaction.  Otherwise, the securitizer must retain an economic interest in the 

transaction consistent with section 941 and any regulations established thereunder, which may increase the 

securitizer’s costs.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires that Federal regulators set the definition of a QRM to be 

no broader than the definition of a QM. 


 - 9 - 

These loans are classified as QMs under the rule.
16

  The small proportion of mortgages 

originated at present outside of these programs, for the most part, are being underwritten 

to tight standards consistent with the QM definition. 

As lender risk appetite increases and private capital returns to the mortgage 

market, a larger non-QM market should start to develop.  Two aspects of the QM rule, 

though, may make this market slow to develop for borrowers with lower credit scores.  

First, the QM requirement that borrower payments on all debts and some recurring 

obligations must be 43 percent or less of borrower income may disproportionately affect 

less-advantaged borrowers.
17 

 Board staff tabulations based on the Survey of Consumer 

Finances indicate that such households tend to have lower incomes, fewer financial 

assets, and higher mortgage loan-to-value ratios than households with lower payment 

ratios (figure 14).
18


Second, the QM definition affects lenders’ ability to charge for the risks of 

originating loans to borrowers who are more likely to default.  For example, lenders may 

in general compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the loan.  

However, if lenders originate a first-lien QM with an annual percentage rate that is 

150 basis points or more above the rate available to the highest-quality borrowers, lenders 

receive less protection against lawsuits claiming violation of the ability-to-repay and QM 

                                                 
16

 This provision is slated to end no later than January 2021.  The Dodd-Frank Act gives the FHA, the VA, 

the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the RHS the option to write separate QM regulations for their 

mortgages.   
17

 Borrowers with debt-to-income (DTI) ratios greater than 43 percent may still be able to obtain QMs if the 

mortgage is guaranteed by the FHA or eligible for purchase by the GSEs. 
18

 The tabulation is based on households that purchased a home with mortgage credit in the two years 

preceding the Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances for 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 (the surveys are 

available at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm).  About 15 percent of borrowers in the 

2001, 2004, and 2010 surveys and 25 percent in the 2007 survey had DTIs greater than 43 percent.  The 

2007 statistic was reported incorrectly in the March 2013 Mortgage Bankers Association speech (see Duke, 

“Comments on Housing and Mortgage Markets,” in note 1).  DTI is measured at the time of the survey, not 

at the time of the loan origination, and may understate the number of affected households if household 

finances improve after the purchase of a home.

rules.
19

  Lenders who prefer to price for risk through points and fees face the constraint 

that points and fees on a QM loan may not exceed 3 percent of the loan amount, with 

higher caps available for loans smaller than $100,000.  The extent to which these rules 

regarding rates, points, and fees will damp lender willingness to originate mortgages to 

borrowers with lower credit scores is still unclear. 

To summarize, the housing market is improving, but mortgage credit conditions 

remain quite tight for borrowers with lower credit scores.  And the path to easier credit 

conditions is somewhat murky.  Some of the forces damping mortgage credit availability, 

such as capacity constraints and concerns about economic conditions or house prices, are 

likely to unwind through normal cyclical forces.  However, resolution of lender concerns 

about putback risk or servicing cost seems less clear.  These concerns could be reduced 

by policy changes.  For example, the structure of liability for representations and 

warrantees could be modified.  Or servicing compensation could be changed to provide 

higher compensation for the servicing of delinquent loans.  Or lenders might find ways to 

reduce their exposure to putback risk or servicing cost by strengthening origination and 

servicing platforms.  New mortgage regulations will provide important protections to 

borrowers but may also lead to a permanent increase in the cost of originating loans to 

borrowers with lower credit scores.  It will be difficult to determine the ultimate effect of 

the regulatory changes until they have all been finally defined and lenders gain 

familiarity with them. 

The implications for the housing market are also murky.  Borrowers with lower 

credit scores have typically represented a significant segment of first-time homebuyers.  

                                                 
19

 The CFPB has proposed a higher spread threshold for first-lien QMs originated by small creditors and for 

certain types of balloon mortgages.  


 - 11 - 

For example, in 1999, more than 25 percent of first-time homebuyers had credit scores 

below 620 compared with fewer than 10 percent in 2012 (figure 15).
20

  Although I expect 

housing demand to expand along with the economic recovery, if credit is hard to get, 

much of that demand may be channeled into rental, rather than owner-occupied, housing. 

At the Federal Reserve, we continue to foster more-accommodative financial 

conditions and, in particular, lower mortgage rates through our monetary policy actions.  

We also continue to monitor mortgage credit conditions and consider the implications of 

our rulemakings for credit availability.  For your part, I urge you to continue to develop 

new and more sustainable business models for lending to lower-credit-score borrowers 

that lead to better outcomes  for borrowers, communities, and the financial system than 

we have experienced over the past few years.

 Staff calculations are based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel.  First-

time homebuyers are measured as consumers who have no record of ever having a mortgage at the end of 

the second quarter of a given year and opened a mortgage in the third quarter.  This estimate includes all 

types of mortgages but excludes first-time homebuyers who purchased their homes with cash.  The credit 

score was generated from the Equifax 3.0 risk model and measured the credit score as of the end of the 

second quarter.  Consumers without a credit score are excluded from the analysis.
