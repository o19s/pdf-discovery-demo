Thank you for the kind introduction, and thank you to the Housing Assistance 

Council (HAC) for inviting me to be part of this discussion of rural housing.  I 

understand that you will shortly be presenting awards to people who are working at the 

local and national levels and in both the public and private sectors and whose efforts have 

improved housing conditions for the rural poor.  All of you who work in these roles are 

doing your country a great service by helping to advance economic opportunity in our 

communities.  I want to thank the award recipients for the difference you make in the 

lives of people in rural communities.  

I am happy to report that our economy is currently performing very well overall, 

with strong job creation and gradually rising wages.  The unemployment rate is 

3.7 percent, the lowest since 1969.  A strong job market has encouraged more people to 

participate in the labor market, another positive development.  In fact, by many national-

level measures, our labor market is very strong.   

As those at this conference are acutely aware, however, aggregate statistics can 

mask important variations between different demographic and income groups, as well as 

significant regional differences.  For example, unemployment rates in some persistently 

poor rural counties remain much higher than the national figures.  The annual average 

unemployment rate in 2017 exceeded 10 percent in 27 persistently poor rural counties, 

and the rate was 20 percent or more in 2 of those counties.  Recent Fed research found 

that, since 2007, labor force participation rates for those in their prime working years in 

rural areas have increasingly lagged rates in urban areas.  Labor force participation has 

been particularly low for those with only a high school diploma or less.1  Research has

also found that business formation and employment growth during the recovery have 

been concentrated in large urban areas.2  Data and research findings like these remind us 

that, despite positive trends in national data, the benefits of the ongoing economic 

expansion are still not reaching some communities. 

Through the Fed’s 12 Reserve Banks and their branches, we are able to get a 

clearer picture of conditions in individual communities across the nation.  Each of the 

Reserve Banks has an active, well-staffed community development function--one of the 

great benefits of the Federal Reserve’s structure.  We get important and timely 

information on the state of local economic and financial conditions, including those 

affecting low- and moderate-income, as well as other underserved, communities. 

Our community development staff provide us with a more nuanced understanding 

of current economic and financial conditions.  They also help people in low-income and 

underserved communities overcome the challenges they face.  We support numerous 

initiatives in rural communities across the country, several of which I would like to 

highlight. 

The first initiative is the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis’s longtime 

commitment to the Mississippi and Arkansas Delta region.  This region has struggled for 

decades with persistent intergenerational poverty and a lack of resources and capacity to 

address this challenge.  Most recently, in 2016 the St. Louis Fed launched the Delta 

Communities Initiative, and since then it has held 26 regional forums with more than 

500 participants.  These forums help to build awareness of promising tools and strategies

for community and economic development.  A recent survey of participants suggests that 

these forums are making a real difference.   

A second example is the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas’s commitment to 

advancing digital inclusion in low-income rural communities.  Despite significant effort 

and advances made by public, private, and nonprofit organizations in recent years, nearly 

30 percent of rural households continue to lack access to broadband internet service.  

Also, fewer than half of households earning less than $20,000 per year have such 

service.3  In an increasingly digital economy, lack of access to high-speed internet and the 

knowledge of how to make the best use of it limits the ability of families and entire 

communities to reach their full potential.  To address this problem, the Dallas Fed has 

explored the role of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) in addressing the digital 

divide, the potential for technology to bridge the urban-rural divide in access to health 

care, and the critical importance of preparing workers for the digital economy.4 

Third and last, community development staff at the Federal Reserve Board and 

several Reserve Banks have conducted research to better understand housing affordability 

challenges affecting rural communities nationwide, recognizing the importance of 

sufficient affordable housing to a community’s economic vitality.  Researchers found 

that, as in many urban areas nationwide, a large portion of renters in rural communities

struggle to afford their rent--a finding that will not come as a surprise in this room.  

Fortunately, our staff also highlighted promising policy and practice solutions that have 

been implemented in some communities to try to address these challenges, including the 

establishment of dedicated funding for affordable housing and the elimination of 

exclusionary land use and zoning policies.5 

While this type of research and community engagement work is a central 

component of our efforts to support rural areas, we also know that communities need 

resources and dedicated local partners to help implement many of the strategies involved.  

CRA has been an important tool for strengthening local community and economic 

development infrastructure since it was enacted in 1977.  We also recognize that 

significant changes in the financial services industry since then have hindered the law’s 

effectiveness, especially in rural communities, and that an update of the implementing 

regulations is appropriate.  As my colleague Governor Brainard has noted, one of the 

principles guiding our CRA modernization work is that any redesign of CRA regulations 

should continue to encourage banks to seek opportunities in underserved areas, including 

rural communities.   

I understand that the HAC has done considerable research and stakeholder 

engagement to shed light on the barriers to the effective use of CRA in rural 

communities; all of that work will benefit our reform efforts.  The Fed’s ongoing series of

roundtable discussions in communities across the country will also allow us to hear 

suggestions for improving CRA from local stakeholders, including many people from 

rural communities.  These perspectives will inform our deliberations on this critical 

regulation, and we will make a summary of our discussions available to the public. 

In closing, while the economy is strong overall, we recognize that some 

communities have yet to feel the full benefits of the ongoing expansion.  We are 

conducting research, collaborating with communities, and assessing financial regulations 

so that our nation’s current prosperity will benefit small towns and cities alike.  The work 

being done by tonight’s award recipients and by each of you in this room is critical to 

making progress toward that goal.  Thank you for being our partners in this work, and 

enjoy the conference.
