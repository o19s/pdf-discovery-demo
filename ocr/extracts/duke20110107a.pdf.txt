I am pleased to be here at the beginning of a new year to offer my assessment of 

recent economic developments and the economic outlook for 2011.  I also plan to discuss 

the actions that the Federal Reserve has been taking to support the economic recovery.  

Before I begin, I want to emphasize that the views that I will be presenting are my own 

and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) or the Board of Governors. 

Recent Economic and Financial Developments 

 In the third quarter of 2009, the U.S. economy began to emerge from the deepest 

recession of the post-World War II period--one that had been precipitated by a severe 

financial crisis.  Economic history teaches that such downturns typically are deeper, and 

that the pace of their subsequent recoveries is more moderate, than is the case for 

business cycles not associated with financial crises.  Certainly, that has been the U.S. 

experience for the past year and a half:  Real economic activity has been steadily 

recovering overall, but the speed and strength of the rebound have been restrained by 

significant financial headwinds.  

 Perhaps the most telling measure of the modest pace of the economic recovery is 

the painfully slow improvement in the labor market.  To be sure, we are seeing some 

signs of improvement in the data.  Indicators of hiring and job openings have continued 

to rise in recent months, and, more recently, new claims for unemployment insurance 

have begun falling again.  Still, 18 months into recovery, there are more than 7 million 

fewer jobs in the economy than there were just prior to the recession, and the 

unemployment rate remains stubbornly close to its peak.  American families have not 

experienced such a prolonged and severe period of unemployment since the early 1980s.

 On a positive note, the recent news on production and spending offers some 

encouragement that the expansion may be gaining traction.  Manufacturing production, 

which rebounded sharply during the first year of the recovery, has continued to expand at 

a solid rate in recent months.  Importantly, while earlier gains in factory production were 

supported largely by the rebuilding of business inventories, the recent increases represent 

a strengthening in domestic demand for domestically produced goods.  Moreover, with 

the recovery in economic activity abroad, exports have also been providing a boost to our 

manufacturing sector.  

  Consumer spending, which rose at only a modest rate in the first year of the 

recovery, has strengthened in recent months.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE), 

adjusted for inflation, increased at an annual rate of 3-3/4 percent between June and 

November, with sales increasing across a relatively broad range of consumer goods and 

services.  The pickup included an increase in purchases of autos and light trucks that, in 

turn, prompted automakers to increase their assembly schedules for early this year.  And 

while we don’t have December data yet, initial reports of holiday spending have been 

strong. 

Nonetheless, even with the recent pickup, consumer spending has not provided its 

usual cyclical boost to the recovery, as households have been restrained by the substantial 

loss of wealth they sustained during the financial crisis, persistently high unemployment, 

and reduced availability of credit.  The good news is that some of these restraints have 

been easing:  Rising stock prices have been helping rebuild household wealth, the ratio of 

debt to income has come down, and delinquency rates on consumer loans have been 

falling.  The supply of consumer credit has also improved somewhat over the past year, 


 - 3 -

although the terms and conditions for some types of consumer loans are still tight relative 

to historical norms.   

 Business investment in equipment and software, which rebounded strongly early 

in the recovery, continued to post solid gains through the fall.  The health of larger firms 

with access to capital markets has shown steady improvement over the past year.  

Operating earnings per share for S&P 500 firms have been rising, net debt financing by 

nonfinancial corporations has been increasing, and indicators of corporate credit quality 

have continued to improve.  For these firms, the outlook appears positive:  Recent 

surveys of purchasing managers across a range of manufacturing and nonmanufacturing 

firms indicated an increase in their plans for capital spending in the coming year.  In 

contrast, for small businesses, the situation has been more difficult.  Surveys of bank 

lending indicate that banks are no longer tightening credit terms for loans to small 

businesses, but interest rates on small business loans remain high relative to market rates, 

and outstanding volumes of small loans to businesses continue to decline.  According to 

the latest survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, small business 

owners see some improvement in credit availability, but they still have not seen the 

pickup in sales that would trigger more investment.   

 One area of continued stress is housing.  After what looked to be a gradual 

recovery in new homebuilding during 2009 and early 2010, new single-family starts 

slumped again during the summer and remained depressed in recent months.  Sales of 

new and existing homes are still at very low levels, and inventory remains high compared 

with the monthly pace of sales.  House prices--even apart from sales of bank-owned 

properties--have been falling again, and many households appear to have lost confidence 


 - 4 -

that prices will turn up anytime soon.  Disturbing reports of foreclosure improprieties 

have heightened concerns about mortgage loan servicing and mortgage modifications and 

have created uncertainty about the pace and volume of foreclosure sales yet to come.  

Delinquency and default rates on existing mortgages seem to have peaked, but they 

remain at historically high rates.  And while low mortgage interest rates have contributed 

to strong refinancing activity, many households are still unable to qualify for the loans 

with the most favorable terms due to depressed home values, reduced income, or weaker 

credit scores.   

 The commercial real estate market is also still quite anemic.  Even after almost 

three years of declining investment in office and commercial structures, vacancy rates are 

still elevated and property prices remain weak.  Financing conditions for commercial real 

estate remain tight, and delinquency rates deteriorated further during the third quarter of 

2010.  That said, some modest signs of improvement have surfaced:  After having 

declined for two years, prices of commercial real estate, although still volatile, have 

changed little, on net, since the spring, and the number of property sale transactions has 

increased recently.  Also, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has turned 

up, albeit from a low level.  

 State and local governments also continue to struggle.  The federal fiscal stimulus 

of the past two years helped shore up this sector, but did not prevent significant cutbacks 

in services and employment that were associated with the steep decline in revenues 

sustained during the recession.  In the second half of 2010, with some pickup in retail 

spending and moderate gains in taxable income, revenues began to firm and outlays by 

state and local governments appeared to stabilize.  Nonetheless, these jurisdictions will 


 - 5 -

continue to face significant pressures to satisfy balanced budget requirements and to 

rebuild their depleted reserve funds at the same time that federal stimulus grants are 

winding down.   

 With the recovery proceeding at a moderate rate and the margin of economic 

slack quite wide, the underlying rate of inflation has been trending lower despite upward 

pressure from rising costs of energy and other commodities and rising prices of imported 

goods.  In the 12 months ending in November, overall inflation in PCE prices was 

1.0 percent, and the 12-month change in core PCE inflation, which excludes more-

volatile food and energy costs, was just 0.8 percent.  Both measures show that inflation 

has drifted lower over the preceding year, and that slowing appears to have been broadly 

based.  Indeed, even after reviewing a number of measures of the underlying trend in 

inflation, I find it difficult to identify a single measure that doesn’t show that inflation has 

drifted steadily lower.  At the same time, longer-run inflation expectations still appear to 

be stable.   

The Economic Outlook 

 Although the recovery continues to be uneven across sectors, recent economic and 

financial developments are broadly consistent with my forecast that the economic 

recovery will gain even more momentum and that the expansion will become sufficiently 

strong to gradually bring down the unemployment rate.  Key elements of my forecast 

include further strengthening in consumer spending and business investment in 

equipment and software, both of which will receive additional support from the recently 

enacted tax package.  Given the currently high level of resource slack and my projection 


 - 6 -

for only a gradual reduction in unemployment, I expect that inflation will remain 

subdued.  

 My forecast for continued growth in consumer spending is predicated on an 

assumption of ongoing recovery in wage and salary income that should accompany an 

expected pickup in hiring.  In addition, household balance sheets should gradually 

strengthen as asset prices firm and continued deleveraging reduces household debt. 

    As the recovery continues, businesses should become more confident about 

expanding--by both upgrading facilities and adding workers.  To date, larger firms have 

contributed importantly to the recovery in business spending, and they seem well 

positioned for further investment.  Over time, small businesses, which have been held 

back by the slow recovery in demand and greater difficulties in obtaining credit, should 

also become more able to increase their spending and expand their operations.   

 Prospects for U.S. trade are generally favorable.  Global economic activity 

rebounded rapidly during the initial stages of the recovery, buoyed by a bounceback in 

global trade and inventory restocking around the world.  Activity abroad has slowed more 

recently and seems to be settling on a sustainable path that still should result in rising 

demand for U.S. exports.  Barring any significant spillover from the financial turmoil in 

peripheral European countries, the expansion abroad should continue.  In that regard, I 

should note that renewed concerns about fiscal strains and banking-sector problems in the 

euro-area periphery have recently contributed to increased volatility in financial markets, 

but, to date, we have not seen a widespread pullback. 

 My outlook for the housing market and for commercial real estate is more 

cautious.  A sustained recovery in income and jobs will be an important prerequisite for a 


 - 7 -

recovery in the housing industry.  But until the overhang of vacant homes is reduced 

significantly and home values begin to firm, new residential construction is likely to 

remain at low levels.  Similarly, time will be required to absorb the currently large 

amount of vacant office and commercial space before construction in that sector begins to 

turn up noticeably.   

 One important element of the outlook is my expectation that financial market 

functioning and lending conditions will continue to improve, providing additional support 

for a further pickup in consumer and business spending.  During the financial crisis, 

banks reported on our quarterly survey an extraordinary tightening of their lending 

standards.  To date, only a small part of that tightening appears to have been reversed.  As 

banks continue to repair their balance sheets and develop greater confidence in the 

economic outlook, I anticipate that standards will improve further over coming quarters.  

Nonetheless, I expect loan volumes, especially real estate loan volumes, to recover only 

slowly as both borrowers and lenders proceed cautiously.   

One notable exception to my forecast for gradual improvement in financial 

markets is my expectation that residential mortgage markets could take a number of years 

to repair as policymakers and market participants grapple with the role of government in 

housing finance, adapt to changing regulation, and look for ways to better manage and 

price the risks associated with mortgage lending and servicing.  Whatever the structure of 

housing finance is to become, the large overhang of problem loans and weak housing 

markets will necessitate a gradual transition. 

 Based on all of these assumptions, I expect a gradual decline in unemployment 

this year and little change in the underlying rate of inflation.

Monetary Policy 

The Congress has charged the Federal Reserve with two monetary policy 

objectives, known as our dual mandate--the achievement of maximum employment and 

price stability.  As I noted earlier, the financial crisis and severe recession left the 

economy far below levels of resource utilization consistent with maximum sustained 

employment.  And the wide margins of economic slack that have persisted have moved 

inflation below a level of 2 percent or a bit less, which is the rate that most FOMC 

participants see as consistent with our dual mandate.  In light of these disappointing 

results, monetary policy continues to be focused on ensuring that the economic recovery 

is sufficiently strong to sustain noticeable progress toward our mandated objectives.   

I would like to take a few minutes to offer some perspectives on how monetary 

policy has been meeting this challenge.  As you know, the Federal Reserve responded 

forcefully to the financial crisis by employing a range of measures and programs to 

provide badly needed liquidity to financial institutions and markets.  At the same time, 

the FOMC used both standard and less-conventional forms of monetary policy to 

promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.   

  The standard way in which the FOMC stimulates the economy is by reducing the 

target for the overnight federal funds rate and shaping expectations about future policy 

actions through the FOMC’s statement and other communications.  Such policy actions 

typically lead to lower interest rates and a broader easing of financial conditions that 

together boost business and household spending and net exports.  However, after the 

FOMC lowered its target for the federal funds rate to near zero in December 2008, that 

conventional policy tool was essentially no longer available.  To provide additional 


 - 9 -

accommodation, between December 2008 and March 2010, the FOMC elected to 

purchase large amounts of longer-term Treasury, agency, and agency mortgage-backed 

securities (MBS).  Those purchases put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates 

generally and helped normalize the spread between mortgage rates and long-term 

Treasury rates, which had widened during the financial crisis.  Reducing longer-term 

rates influences the economy in much the same way as lowering the expected path of 

short-term rates.  For instance, the decline in longer-term rates lowers the cost and 

increases the availability of capital and credit, which in turn encourages business 

expansion.  In the most recent episode, another important result of lower rates has been a 

reduction in debt service burdens from existing debt.  Households in particular have 

significantly reduced mortgage payments through refinancing.  And numerous small 

business owners have told me that they could not have survived the downturn without 

low rates. 

Economic activity picked up in early 2010, but by the time the FOMC met in 

August, the rate of growth seemed to be slowing and inflation continued to drift lower.  

In addition, lower mortgage rates were resulting in faster prepayment of mortgages 

underlying the agency MBS held by the Federal Reserve.  To avoid the modest monetary 

tightening that would result from the Fed’s gradually shrinking portfolio of agency MBS, 

the FOMC voted to reinvest all principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in 

longer-term Treasury securities.  The Committee also began a discussion about the 

strength of the recovery, the amount of slack in the economy, the likely path of inflation, 

and the appropriate action to provide additional monetary accommodation should such 

action be deemed necessary.  In November, the FOMC judged that additional monetary 


 - 10 -

policy stimulus was needed to support the economic recovery and help ensure that 

inflation, over time, returned to desired levels.  To implement that stimulus, the 

Committee decided to expand its holdings of securities by purchasing an additional 

$600 billion in longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.   

 After considering the costs and benefits of the action and recognizing that taking 

no action would have its own risks, I believe that the expansion of securities holdings was 

worth implementing to support the economy and make the recovery more durable.  I 

don’t want to overpromise.  This action is not a panacea.  While it is still premature to 

judge the overall efficacy of the program, I believe that by exerting downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates, it has provided and will continue to provide support for a 

vulnerable recovery.  At the same time, I believe the risks associated with this action are 

manageable, that we have the safeguards in place to monitor evolving conditions, and, 

most importantly, that we have the conviction to act when necessary.   

Based on our own research and that of others, evidence is accumulating that 

purchases of longer-term assets have been successful in exerting downward pressure on 

longer-term rates.1  Consistent with research on the effects of asset purchases, between 

August, when Chairman Bernanke in a speech first publicly suggested the Federal 

Reserve might take additional action, and November, when the action was taken, longer-

term Treasury rates fell as market participants priced in additional Fed purchases.2  

However, since the announcement of the decision to purchase longer-term Treasury 

securities, longer-term rates have actually increased.  It might seem that the recent 

increase in rates contradicts the view that Fed asset purchases put downward pressure on 

rates.  However, the logic behind this view works in both directions.  If the market 

expects the Fed to respond to weak economic conditions by buying more assets, investors 

bid up the assets and rates fall.  Conversely, if the market expects the economy to 

strengthen, investors ratchet back expectations for Fed purchases and reduce their bid for 

the assets, and rates rise.  I believe that the current rise in rates is due to exactly this latter 

circumstance--a strengthening in market participants’ outlook for the economy and a 

corresponding decrease in the market’s expectation for future accommodation.    

One concern that has been raised about asset purchases is the resulting expansion 

of the Fed’s balance sheet and the corresponding increase in reserves.  For example, some 

observers have noted that an increase in reserve balances could lead to an increase in the 

money supply, which would in turn generate inflation pressures.  Others have worried 

that elevated levels of reserve balances might make it difficult for the Federal Reserve to 

remove monetary accommodation at the appropriate time.  While we will need to remain 

alert to economic developments, I am convinced that we can and will manage these risks. 

The monetary policy objective of asset purchases is to foster downward pressure 

on interest rates.  But assets are “paid for” by crediting the reserve balances of banks, 

generating higher levels of reserve balances in the banking system.  Reserves are relevant

to the growth of the money supply because banks are required to hold a percentage of 

some types of deposits as reserves with the Federal Reserve.  Thus, the total amount of 

reserves in the banking system acts to cap maximum reservable deposits.  It is important 

to note that it is deposits, not reserve balances, that are included in the monetary 

aggregates used to measure the money supply.  For example, M1 is made up of currency, 

traveler’s checks, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits, while M2 is made up of 

M1 plus savings, small time deposits, and retail money market mutual funds.   

Moreover, the linkage between the level of reserve balances and the monetary 

aggregates in the current environment is quite weak.  You were probably taught, as I was, 

that the broad monetary aggregates increase when reserve balances increase because the 

larger volume of reserves supports increased lending, which in turn leads to a larger 

volume of reservable deposits.  While that argument might hold in normal circumstances, 

in the current environment excess reserves are many multiples of required reserves, and 

adding reserves is unlikely to spark a further increase in the volume of deposits.  As a 

result, the textbook linkage between reserve balances, bank loans, and transaction 

deposits just is not operative at present.  Fundamentally, the levels of M1 and M2 are 

determined by the strength of the economy and the preferences of businesses and 

consumers for money, which depend on the yields on monetary instruments and 

competing assets.   

Recent experience has again illustrated the difficulty in identifying a reliable 

relationship between reserve balances and the monetary aggregates.  Even though Federal 

Reserve actions to fight the financial crisis and support the economic recovery added 


 - 13 -

roughly $1 trillion to a base of about $43 billion in aggregate bank reserves, M1 and M2 

rose at relatively moderate rates over the same period.  

Going one step further, I should note that the linkage between the monetary 

aggregates and either real economic activity or inflation has been very weak over recent 

decades.  The lack of a reliable relationship between the monetary aggregates and the 

economy led the Federal Reserve to abandon M1 as a key policy instrument in the early 

1980s and then to reduce the role of M2 as a policy instrument in the late 1980s and early 

1990s.  Indeed, in a 2006 speech about the historic use of monetary aggregates in setting 

Federal Reserve policy, Chairman Bernanke pointed out that, “in practice, the difficulty 

has been that, in the United States, deregulation, financial innovation, and other factors 

have led to recurrent instability in the relationships between various monetary aggregates 

and other nominal variables.”3  Still, my colleagues and I will be monitoring a wide range 

of financial and economic developments very closely--including the growth of the money 

supply, inflation, and many other financial and nonfinancial variables--and, based on a 

full assessment of those developments, the FOMC will withdraw monetary 

accommodation at the appropriate time.  My view is that the elevated reserve balances 

would be inflationary only if they prevented the FOMC from effectively removing 

monetary accommodation by raising interest rates when the time comes to remove such 

accommodation, and I am convinced that that will not be the case. 

The FOMC has a number of tools at its disposal for raising interest rates.  When 

appropriate, the Federal Reserve can put upward pressure on interest rates by raising the 

rate it pays on reserve balances.  Moreover, we have developed new tools that will allow

us to drain reserves if necessary.  In particular, we can drain large volumes of reserves by 

replacing them with repurchase agreements and term deposits.  Finally, we can always 

sell the securities we purchased.  Such sales would not only drain reserves but would also 

put direct upward pressure on longer-term rates. 

Conclusion 

Overall, the recovery in economic activity to date has been uneven and has not 

been sufficient to reduce unemployment noticeably.  But I am encouraged by signs that 

the recovery may have gained traction recently.  And I believe that sustained gains in 

consumer spending and business investment and a further easing of credit conditions will 

reinforce each other, leading to greater confidence and improving the prospects for an 

extended expansion that, over time, will reduce unemployment to a level consistent with 

full employment.  At the same time, I anticipate that inflation will remain subdued.  

Finally, I believe that the actions taken by the FOMC to support the economic recovery 

are appropriate, and I am confident in our commitment to monitor economic conditions 

and take action as needed.
