December 13, 2017 



I would like to thank the staff at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for 

inviting me to attend this awards ceremony.1   As many of you may already know, the 

Leading the Way campaign is a joint effort between the Federal Reserve Bank and the P-

TECH2 schools of the Greater Rochester area.  It is wonderful to be part of an event that 

celebrates collaboration between educational institutions, local government, the Federal 

Reserve, and employers as they work together to provide appropriate training for young 

workers to fill local jobs needs.  Collaboration creates a more vibrant workforce that is 

connected to actual jobs. 

Today’s Job Market 

I have just come from a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  

The FOMC is one of the main policymaking committees of the Federal Reserve System.  

Our main job on the FOMC is to set interest rates to achieve the maximum level of 

employment in the country and sustain inflation at a moderate level.   

The nation’s unemployment rate is currently around 4.1 percent, which is a 

relatively low level by historical standards.  What that means for the young people 

participating in this program is that this is a great time to find a job.  Moreover, not only 

is the national unemployment rate low, so are unemployment rates for young people and 

members of ethnic and racial groups that have traditionally faced greater challenges in 

the labor market.  As many of you know, during the deep recession of 2008 and 2009, 

many Americans were so discouraged by poor job prospects that they stopped even 

looking for work.  That meant that too many Americans were sitting on the sidelines.  In

the past few years, the job market has gotten so strong that many of these people have 

come off the sidelines--and many are now back at work. 

The Rochester area, like much of the country, has now recovered from the Great 

Recession. The education and health-care sectors continue to be the main drivers of job 

growth.  And, the local community colleges have partnered with local employers to align 

their curriculums with the employers’ job openings, to increase workers’ connections to 

jobs, and to become a resource for regional job information.  Finally, the local 

government has worked to contend with a long-term loss of jobs in manufacturing and a 

more recent loss of jobs in professional services by attracting investment in a world-class 

photonics hub in Rochester.   

I often meet with people who run large companies to get their take on the strength 

of the economy.  Whereas a few years ago, they might not have been engaged in a lot of 

hiring, today they tell me that it is becoming more challenging to find well-qualified 

workers for the job openings they want to fill.  That’s good news for those of you 

participating in the P-TECH program.  It means employers are looking for graduates of 

programs just like yours, which are attuned to the job opportunities of employers.  

P-TECH Rochester programs offer students professional mentors, job shadowing 

opportunities, and on-the-job experience to ensure that they are ready to contribute 

positively to the workplaces of local employers.  I also understand that companies are 

investing more in on-the-job training and are strengthening efforts to retain more of the 

workers they attract, which means younger workers--such as P-TECH graduates--have a 

better chance of securing jobs that lead to long-lasting careers.  By any measure, the

market for younger workers today looks much better than it did in the years just after the 

Great Recession, when unemployment rates for teenagers were above 20 percent.3        

  In fact, firms are turning more and more to programs like P-TECH to help them 

find and train the workers they need.  So the skills you are gaining today are likely to 

provide pathways not only to the jobs of today but also the careers of the future.   

Workforce Development 

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is one of the facilitators of the Leading 

the Way campaign.  The Federal Reserve System has a long-standing interest in 

understanding labor market dynamics and promoting workforce development 

opportunities. Programs like this help workers prepare for jobs and help firms invest in 

workforce development.  Together, these efforts help make the economy more productive 

and help us achieve our goal of maximum employment.  In addition to the Federal 

Reserve Bank of New York’s efforts, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston is learning 

about labor markets in small industrial cities through their Working Cities Challenge and 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas has focused on the importance of infrastructure 

including broadband for economic inclusion.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has 

been a leader within the Federal Reserve System in establishing the Investing in 

America’s Workforce Initiative, an effort across the Federal Reserve System to reframe 

training expenditures as investments in human capital rather than costs.  In October, 

Atlanta established the Center for Workforce and Economic Opportunity to focus on 

employment policies and labor market issues that affect low- and moderate-income

individuals.  The System also recently hosted a national conference in Austin to promote 

the importance of investing in America’s workforce.4 

As employers’ demand for specific education and training increase, collaborative 

initiatives, like those exhibited through the P-TECH programs of Greater Rochester, will 

help minimize the skills mismatch appearing in many communities with burgeoning job 

markets.   

Young Workers 

Since 2013, the Federal Reserve Board has been administering the Survey of 

Young Workers to learn more about work experiences and future prospects for 18-to-30-

year-olds nationwide.  When I look at the survey findings, I am struck by how well the P-

TECH program addresses many of the issues young people identified in the survey. 

As a first example, the survey findings highlight the important correlation 

between postsecondary education and labor market outcomes.  The survey data indicate 

that higher levels of educational attainment are associated with higher earnings, greater 

job satisfaction, and increased optimism about one’s job future.  P-TECH focuses on 

providing students with postsecondary credentials, helping to address one of the survey’s 

main concerns. 

Second, responses to the survey underscore the importance of young workers 

receiving appropriate information that enables them to select an educational program that 

provides better labor market outcomes.  The survey found that more than 30 percent of

young adults did not receive information about jobs and careers in high school and 

college.  P-TECH is focused on providing information about educational opportunities 

and jobs to students before they enter high school.   

Third, the survey found that many young workers are not employed in fields 

aligned with their education.  Fewer than half (45 percent) of the young workers surveyed 

said they were employed in a career field that is closely related to their educational and 

training background.  P-TECH focuses on aligning education with actual jobs.   

Finally, the survey found that steady employment is very important to young 

workers.  In 2015, young adults had a strong preference for steady employment (62 

percent) over higher pay (36 percent).  And, among the respondents who preferred steady 

employment, 80 percent would rather have one steady job than a stream of steady jobs for 

the next five years.  The work that P-TECH students do directly with employers helps 

steer them toward long-term, steady employment. 

Conclusion 

In conclusion, I am proud that the Federal Reserve is contributing to the efforts of 

the P-TECH program in the Rochester area and I look forward to the video presentations 

we will have shortly.   I want to congratulate in advance the winners of the video 

competition, who will also be announced shortly.  I also want to congratulate all of you 

for being part of a 21st century education program that will help connect you to pathways 

of opportunity and help enable you to make important contributions to the vitality of your 

community.
