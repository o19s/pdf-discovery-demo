A Tiered Approach to Regulation and Supervision of Community Banks 





Remarks by 


Daniel K. Tarullo 


Member 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


Community Bankers Symposium 


Chicago, Illinois 







November 7, 2014 









Earlier this year—also speaking to a conference at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 

—I explained the need for an explicitly tiered approach to banking regulation and supervision.1  

Today I would like to elaborate on those earlier remarks to suggest in more detail what a tiered 

approach would mean for community banks.  Let me begin, though, by recapitulating my basic 

premise and the reasoning behind it. 

Rationale for Regulatory Tiering 

For more than 75 years following passage of the Banking Act of 1933, the motivation for 

banking regulation was fairly simple: the government had granted deposit insurance and access 

to the discount window to depository institutions to forestall runs and panics.  The resulting 

moral hazard and the use of insured deposits as a funding source for these institutions justified 

prudential measures, including prohibitions on non-banking activities, aimed at maintaining safe 

and sound banks, which would in turn protect taxpayers.  Prudential regulation of bank holding 

companies by the Federal Reserve under authority granted by the Bank Holding Company Act of 

1956 was aimed primarily at protecting insured depository institutions and the federal deposit 

insurance fund from knock-on effects of problems at affiliated nonbank businesses.    

This approach is what we now characterize as microprudential—that is, the focus is on 

the soundness of individual banks rather than on the financial system more broadly.  This is not

to say that financial stability had not been important to financial regulators, but this stability was 

implicitly assumed to follow from having sound individual banks.  

Over the years, of course, banking regulation evolved.  For example, regulation expanded 

to encompass fair and open access to financial services for consumers.  And, as developments in 

financial markets and deregulation over the past several decades led to a more concentrated 

financial sector in which bank holding companies could engage in a much broader range of 

activities, supervision was tiered within the bank regulatory agencies based on the size and 

complexity of the regulated institutions.  But the financial crisis provoked a fundamental rethink 

of the aims of prudential regulation. 

There is now more widespread agreement that these aims should vary according to the 

size, scope, and range of activities of banking organizations.  Most significantly, banks of a size 

and complexity such that serious stress or failure could pose risks to the entire financial system 

need regulation that incorporates the macroprudential aim of protecting financial stability.2   

There is also a good argument that very large banks that fall short of this level of systemic 

importance should nonetheless be regulated with an eye to macroprudential aims, such as the 

ability of the banking system as a whole to provide credit.   

Although individual community banks may be an important source of credit, particularly 

in local economies outside urban areas, neither systemic risk nor broad macroprudential 

considerations are significant in thinking about prudential regulation of community banks.  So 

what should the aims of such regulation be?  The basic answer is it should protect the deposit

insurance fund.  In other words, the traditional microprudential approach to safety and soundness 

regulation continues to be appropriate for these banks.  To develop that basic answer, I think it 

useful to begin with an understanding of both the business model of community banks—that is, 

how their financial intermediation adds value to the economy—and the ways in which such 

banks are most likely to encounter problems. 

There are roughly 5,700 community banks in the United States, the vast majority of 

which have less than $1 billion in total assets.3  These banks represent 98 percent of insured U.S. 

commercial banks, but collectively hold just under 20 percent of aggregate banking assets.  

Moreover, the business model of most community banks, especially smaller and rural banks, is 

built substantially on relationship banking.  While community banks have over the years found it 

increasingly difficult to compete with larger banks in types of lending that can be efficiently 

scaled through larger volumes and standardized credit models, they maintain a comparative 

advantage relative to larger competitors through knowledge of their local communities and their 

individual borrowers.4  This means that community banks play a unique role in their local 

economies, particularly with regard to lending to small- and medium-sized businesses.  

Numerous studies have documented this advantage and its value to economic 

development.  One recent study found that loans extended by rural community banks to small 

businesses default less frequently than similar loans granted by their urban counterparts, and that 

the performance advantage is greater when the bank and the borrower are located in the same 

                                                 
3 For supervisory purposes, the Federal Reserve typically defines community banks as those with $10 billion or less 

in total assets.  In addition, these remarks will refer to both “community banks” and “community banking 

organizations.”  While the former typically refers to depository institutions and the latter refers to banking groups 

more generally, including holding companies, for purposes of my remarks today these are used interchangeably 

unless indicated otherwise. 
4 Of course, larger banks may also devote important parts of their business to relationship lending, but it is 

sometimes suggested that, even so, smaller banks whose management is present in local communities are better 

adapted to relationship lending business models.

county.  This finding suggests that the “soft” information obtained from their local relationships 

usefully informs rural community banks’ underwriting.5  Federal Reserve research also suggests 

that many community banks that adhered to the traditional relationship banking model of 

funding local lending with customer deposits continued to thrive even during the worst years of 

the financial crisis.6   

In contrast, many small banks that turned to a more transactional model and funded 

construction loans—often outside of their local market—with borrowings, rather than core 

deposits, failed.  And, precisely because of their business model, community banks do have their 

vulnerabilities.  They are more likely to have geographic and portfolio concentrations that can 

make them vulnerable to localized economic problems.  Of course, the failure of a community 

bank in these circumstances will only exacerbate these problems.  Especially in rural areas, the 

disappearance of community banks could result in a permanent reduction in this local kind of 

credit, as the slack may not all be picked up by larger banks.7  Additionally, of course, there will 

usually be issues requiring supervisory and management consideration for at least a time.  At 

present, as I know you have been hearing from your supervisors, these issues include 

cybersecurity and interest rate risks.

To return, then, to the aims of prudential regulation of community banks, it seems that we 

can fill out the basic aims of protecting the deposit insurance fund and supporting the availability 

of relationship lending across the country by concentrating on traditional capital regulation to 

ensure solvency and on traditional examination practice to monitor the basic soundness of the 

relationship lending practices.  We may also need to increase scrutiny when community banks 

move beyond their traditional business model and enter lines or markets that are more complex 

or with which they may not be familiar.  But many rules and examinations that are important for 

institutions that are larger, more complex, or both, do not make sense in light of the nature of the 

risks to community banks.  We must avoid importing measures from large bank oversight that 

make relationship banking more costly. 

With that explanation of the purposes of community bank oversight, let me now turn to 

more specific discussion of how we are tailoring regulation and supervision of community banks 

to achieve those aims. 

Tiered Regulation for Community Banks 

There are two complementary ways to implement a tiered approach to prudential 

regulation.  One is to apply specific regulations only to those classes of banking organizations 

whose activities and scale require those measures.  The second is to tailor the application of 

generally applicable measures based on the size, complexity, and possibly other characteristics of 

banking organizations.  We are following both approaches in putting into place an explicitly 

tiered method of regulating community banks.8 

                                                 
8 While not directly the subject of these remarks, it also bears noting that additional tiering of expectations is 

increasingly taking place even among larger banking organizations.  For example, capital planning and stress testing 

requirements are more extensive for the very largest, most systemically important firms than they are for smaller 

regional banking organizations.  Likewise, liquidity and capital requirements are or will be higher for the most 

systemically important firms than for other large banking organizations. 




- 6 - 

An example of tailoring generally applicable regulations is the revised capital guidelines 

that were issued in 2013.9  It was clear in the wake of the financial crisis that strong capital 

positions were essential for banks of all sizes, including community banks.  But a number of 

changes that were appropriate for large banks did not make sense for community banks.  As I am 

sure you all recall, community banks gave us quite a bit of help in identifying which portions of 

the originally proposed rule were, and were not, appropriate for community banks.  Following 

publication of the final capital rule, the three federal banking agencies developed a streamlined, 

supplemental Community Bank Guide to assist bank management in understanding the 

applicability of the rules to smaller, non-complex institutions.10  This exercise is an example of a 

broader effort to be explicit as to how prudential regulations that are sometimes quite detailed 

apply to community banks.  By including such explanations in the introductory portions of 

broadly applicable regulations, our hope is that community bankers will be relieved of the task of 

wading through extensive regulatory texts just to find out what portions apply to their banks.   

This is a good point at which to note that the federal banking agencies have, in 

accordance with the terms of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act 

(EGRPRA), recently launched a review to identify banking regulations that are outdated, 

unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.11  One theme that has already been notable is the belief of

community bankers that many regulations could be tailored more appropriately for community 

banks.  I encourage you to participate in the EGRPRA process by giving us specific examples of 

regulations that should be modified in this way and, even more helpfully, by suggesting specific 

ways in which they might be usefully be tailored. 12 

As to exempting community banks entirely from certain regulations, I should note first 

that many of the statutory requirements introduced by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act do not by their own terms apply to community banks.  So, for example, 

the extensive enhanced prudential standards required by section 165 of Dodd-Frank for bank 

holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets do not apply to smaller banks.  Nor do 

the requirements for stress testing and resolution planning.13  Similarly, the banking agencies 

have used their discretion to exclude community banks from the coverage of some new 

regulations adopted following the crisis.  For example, we recently approved a final rule 

implementing in the United States a Basel agreement that establishes a quantitative minimum 

liquidity requirement, but limited its coverage to banking organizations with more than $50 

billion in assets.14  We excluded community and smaller regional banks, which generally have 

relatively simple funding profiles and do not pose a significant potential risk to the financial 

system. 

However, some statutory requirements by their terms apply to all banks.  Even if we do 

not believe that they actually advance safety and soundness aims for community banks, or 

produce only a small benefit at a disproportionately large compliance cost, we must still enforce

them.  It would be worthwhile to consider amendments to these statutory provisions to carve out 

their applicability to community banks. 

I have previously suggested two candidates for consideration: the Volcker rule and the 

incentive compensation requirements in section 956 of Dodd-Frank.15  The risks addressed by 

these statutory provisions are far more significant at larger institutions than they are at 

community banks.16  Moreover, in the unlikely event that a community bank engages in practices 

in either of these areas that raise heightened concerns, we would be able to address these 

concerns as part of the normal safety-and-soundness supervisory process.  While the banking 

agencies have used the other method of tiering and tried to tailor the Volcker rule (as we will do 

with section 956), I believe that both community banks and supervisors would benefit from not 

having to focus on formal compliance with regulation of matters that are unlikely to pose 

problems at smaller banks. 

Today I would like to add a third candidate for consideration—a statutory amendment 

that would permit the Federal Reserve Board to raise the size of banks covered by our Small 

Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.17  As background, the Board originally issued the 

policy statement in 1980 to facilitate the transfer of ownership of small community banks.  The 

Board generally discourages the use of debt by bank holding companies to finance acquisitions, 

                                                 
15 The Volcker rule applies to all banking entities that engage in prohibited activities, irrespective of size, and the 

Dodd-Frank incentive compensation requirements apply to all banks and holding companies with total assets of 

$1 billion or more. 
16 As indicated in guidance for community banks that was issued with the final Volcker rule, in practice the agencies 

believe that the vast majority of community banks do not engage in prohibited activities.  Because they are not 

expressly exempted from the Volcker rule provisions, however, if community bankers have any questions about 

whether their bank engages in prohibited activities, they may feel obliged to conduct due diligence on a very 

complex rule.  Given the limited de facto applicability to community banks, I would suggest that exempting them 

from Volcker compliance and resolving issues through the supervisory process would be a more effective use of 

bank and supervisory resources.  See Board of Governors, FDIC, and OCC (2013), “The Volcker Rule: Community 

Bank Applicability,” December 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/bcreg20131210a4.pdf.  
17 See 12 CFR part 225, appendix C, www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2014-title12-vol3/pdf/CFR-2014-title12-vol3-

part225-appC.pdf.

because debt can impair the ability of the holding company to serve as a source of strength to 

subsidiary banks.  However, the Board also recognizes that limited access to equity funding by 

small institutions means that the transfer of ownership of small banks often requires the use of 

acquisition debt.   

The policy statement allows small, noncomplex bank holding companies to operate with 

higher levels of debt than would normally be permitted, subject to restrictions to ensure that 

higher debt does not pose an undue risk to subsidiary banks and that leverage is reduced over 

time.  Bank holding companies that are subject to the policy statement are exempt from the 

Board’s risk-based and leverage capital guidelines, and are subject to reduced regulatory 

reporting requirements.18     

The original policy statement set the maximum size of qualifying holding companies at 

$150 million in total consolidated assets.  This threshold was increased to $500 million in 2006 

to address the effects of inflation, industry consolidation, and asset growth.  The intervening 

eight years have obviously brought dramatic changes in the financial, business, and regulatory 

environments.  Accordingly, I believe it is worth considering raising the asset threshold once 

again, this time to $1 billion.  Approximately 85 percent of all bank holding companies qualified 

after the threshold was raised in 2006, a figure that has dropped to about 75 percent today.  

Raising the threshold to $1 billion would recoup that lost coverage and go a bit further, covering 

89 percent of holding companies. 

Such an increase would entail some policy tradeoffs, of course, which obviously become 

of greater concern as the threshold rises further.  But I think the balance of considerations argues 

                                                 
18 Bank holding companies with less than $500 million in assets may still be required to file regulatory reports with 

the same detail and frequency as larger bank holding companies if they meet certain criteria that are set forth in the 

instructions for the Federal Reserve FR Y-9SP and FR Y-9C regulatory reports 

(www.federalreserve.gov/apps/reportforms/default.aspx) or to otherwise meet supervisory needs.  




- 10 - 

for taking this action to facilitate transfers of ownership of small banks.  For example, while 

exempting more bank holding companies could result in increased leverage, subsidiary banks 

remain subject to normal capital requirements.  Supervisory and applications approval processes 

are available to limit instances in which holding companies could take on excessive debt.  

Similarly, because most bank holding companies under $1 billion have limited activities outside 

of their banks, and we will still receive detailed quarterly bank data, the reduced regulatory 

reporting requirements for qualifying holding companies should not be problematic for 

supervisors. 

Of course, the policy statement was issued by the Board and thus one might think the 

Board could raise the threshold on its own.  However, the Collins amendment to Dodd-Frank19 

effectively eliminates any authority of the Board to extend the capital treatment in the policy 

statement to holding companies with assets greater than the threshold in effect on May 19, 2010, 

or to savings and loan holding companies of any size.  Thus, we would need legislative action to 

effect these changes.  

Tiered Supervision 

Federal banking regulators have long organized supervision into portfolios of institutions 

based predominantly—though for larger firms, not exclusively—on asset size.  Various 

provisions of Dodd-Frank motivated the Federal Reserve to modify the composition of the 

portfolios somewhat.  We have four such groups: (1) community banks, (2) regional banking 

organizations, (3) large banking organizations, and (4) firms overseen by the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC).20  This arrangement is not simply a matter of 

                                                 
19 Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
20 Community banking organizations generally are those with $10 billion or less in total assets, regional banking 

organizations are those with total assets between $10 billion and $50 billion, large banking organizations are those 

with total assets over $50 billion, and LISCC firms are the subset of large banking organizations that are largest and

organizational convenience.  Nor is it only a means for promoting consistency of treatment 

among similar banks throughout the Federal Reserve System, important as that goal is.  As with 

tiered regulation, this tiered approach to supervision is intended to take account of differences in 

business models, risks, relative regulatory burden, and other salient considerations.  Where 

specific regulatory goals for the different portfolios vary, the supervisory programs should reflect 

those differences.  And where the goals are similar across portfolios, supervisory programs 

should take account of the differences among banks noted a moment ago.  A tiered approach to 

prudential regulation calls not for a single state of the art in supervision, but for distinct state-of-

the-art approaches to each supervisory portfolio.  Some important implications for community 

bank supervision follow from this principle. 

First, the characteristics and business model of community banks must be reflected in the 

supervisory program.  Detailed rules, regulations, and supervisory expectations are clearly 

needed at times for overseeing the systems created in large, geographically dispersed 

organizations where the distance from head office to operating branches can be very far indeed.  

But in a well-run community bank where the president may oversee a relatively small staff and 

can communicate and enforce expectations and standards face-to-face, some kinds of supervisory 

expectations needed for larger banks may be unnecessary.  In fact, such supervision can be 

burdensome, because community banks have a smaller balance sheet across which to amortize 

compliance costs.  Such rules can also sometimes conflict with the flexibility that is important to 

community banks meeting their customers’ needs.  For instance, community banks should 

readily comply with expectations that they extend credit on safe and sound terms.  However, to 

the extent that supervisors dictate the precise details of what terms are safe and sound, banks 

                                                 
most systemically important.  For more information on the LISCC, including the firms currently in the LISCC 

portfolio, see the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm.

may find it more difficult to structure a loan in a way that matches a borrower’s needs or credit 

situation.  This can result in a lessening of credit availability and economic activity.  Attention to 

a bank’s practices in making its relationship lending decisions, and on the performance of the 

loans that have been made, may be supervisory time better spent.  

A similar observation can be made with respect to consumer compliance supervision of 

community banks, for which the Federal Reserve implemented a new examination program in 

January 2014.21  While we have traditionally applied a risk-focused approach to consumer 

compliance examinations, the new program more explicitly links examination intensity to the 

individual community bank’s risk profile.  Here again, the scale of community banks is directly 

relevant to supervisory choices.  Community banks do not have large, standardized systems for 

dealing with many customers across a far-flung geographic footprint.  They do have much more 

direct contact between customers and bank management.  The new program calls for examiners 

to spend less time on low-risk compliance issues at community banks.  In addition, we revised 

our consumer compliance examination frequency policy to lengthen the time between on-site 

consumer compliance and Community Reinvestment Act examinations for many community 

banks with less than $1 billion in total consolidated assets. 

A second implication of supervisory tiering is that supervision must not inadvertently 

undo the decisions made through regulatory tiering.  This point raises the oft-cited concern about 

“supervisory trickle down,” whereby supervisory expectations—or even regulatory 

requirements—formulated for larger banks are de facto applied in part to community banks.  The 

concern has been particularly acute in the context of capital stress testing, though it is by no

Compliance and Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) Examination Frequency Policy,” Consumer Affairs Letter 

CA 13-20 (November 18).

means limited to that area.  Let me repeat here what all three federal banking agencies have 

explained in the clearest possible terms, both publicly, in examiner training, and in one-on-one 

discussions with bankers: that Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST) and Comprehensive Capital 

Analysis and Review requirements and expectations for enterprise-wide capital stress testing do 

not apply to community banking organizations, either explicitly or implicitly.22  For example, 

while it may be sensible supervisory practice to inquire of a growing $9 billion bank if it has 

begun thinking about how it would meet DFAST requirements should it reach the current $10 

billion statutory threshold, that bank does not need to start meeting those requirements until it 

has actually crossed the threshold.  And there is simply no reason for examiners to make a $5 

billion bank begin to develop capital stress testing capabilities. 

Third, the relatively straightforward business model of community banks, along with 

their relatively small scale and number of branches, provides the opportunity to increase the use 

of off-site supervisory oversight, in accordance with informing principles of risk-based 

supervision.  For example, last year we pilot-tested a voluntary program under which some 

aspects of the loan review process were conducted off-site, relying on the bank’s electronic 

records to assess loan quality and underwriting practices.  Overall, community bankers that were 

part of the pilot expressed strong support for this approach, which reduced the time examiners 

needed to spend on-site at bank offices.  As a result, we plan to continue using this approach in 

future examinations at qualified banks that maintain electronic loan records and wish to 

participate in this approach.  This initiative could tangibly reduce burden on community banking 

organizations.

More generally, the Federal Reserve has invested substantial resources in developing 

technological tools for examiners to improve the efficiency of both off-site and on-site 

supervisory activities.  These tools should lead to greater consistency and more efficient, 

effective, and risk-focused examinations as they assist staff in tailoring the scope of 

examinations to the activities and risks at individual banks.  The automation of various parts of 

the community bank examination process can also save examiners and bank management time, 

as a bank can submit requested pre-examination information electronically rather than mailing 

paper copies to a Federal Reserve Bank.   

These observations relate to another issue that I might note in passing.  As you know, 

there have been questions raised as to whether the level of required reporting is itself a regulatory 

burden that might be mitigated for small banks.  The banking agencies are considering these 

issues under the auspices of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council.  I do think 

there may be some opportunities to streamline the content or frequency of reporting for smaller 

banks.  However, I would observe that many of the efficiency improvements that I have 

previously described were dependent on the data collected each quarter in Call Reports.  For 

example, the availability of this data was a factor in raising the threshold for eligibility for the 

18-month examination cycle from $250 million to $500 million.  Similarly, the regular Call 

Report data for subsidiary banks buttress the case for increasing the threshold for application of 

the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.  Thus, there may be some tradeoffs among 

various possible simplifying supervisory measures. 

Conclusion 

As I noted in my speech six months ago, the old unitary approach to prudential oversight 

has in practical terms been supplanted by various statutory, regulatory, and supervisory

measures, particularly since the financial crisis.  Tiered regulation and supervision is a reality.  

My hope is that by acknowledging and, indeed, applauding that reality, legislators and prudential 

regulators can shape an oversight regime that most effectively realizes the complementary goals 

of banking soundness, financial stability, and economic growth.  Post-crisis attention has 

understandably been focused on too-big-to-fail issues and other sources of systemic risk.  But 

now is a good time to look at the other end of the banking industry, where the contrast is 

substantial.  Smaller banks present a very different set of business models.  Their risks and 

vulnerabilities tend to grow from different sources.  An explicit and sustained tailoring of 

regulation and supervision for community banks not only seems reasonable, it seems an 

important and logical next step in financial regulatory reform.
