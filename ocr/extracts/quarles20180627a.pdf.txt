Utah Bankers Association 110th Annual Convention

Sun Valley, Idaho. 
 


June 27, 2018 



Good afternoon.  It is a particular honor for me be here to address the Utah Bankers 

Association, which is like coming home in two ways: First, to Sun Valley, which is our 

family’s deeply rooted second home--my wife’s great grandfather established the first 

sawmill in the Wood River Valley near Hailey almost 150 years ago--and second, to 

Utah, the place that, like all of you, I dearly love and where I have always lived, despite a 

career that seems determined to keep taking me elsewhere.  

One of those elsewheres is Washington, and as a Utahan who has spent most of 

his career in the private sector advising and investing in the banking industry, I think I 

have a pretty good idea of how things look, from your vantage point, when someone from 

Washington shows up to give a speech.   

Since the financial crisis, bankers have had to adjust to challenging and evolving 

economic conditions and to many new regulations.  At times, smaller and regional banks 

have been left wondering how actions in Washington focused on systemic vulnerabilities 

and the largest institutions were relevant to how they fund their businesses and in turn 

finance the aspirations of families, farmers, ranchers, and other entrepreneurs. 

I’ll start today by trying to address those questions and provide a brief update on 

steps the Congress and the Federal Reserve are taking related to financial regulation.  A 

decade after the crisis, implementation of the major post-crisis reforms is largely 

complete, and we have entered a new phase that is aimed at reviewing and improving 

regulations to ensure that they are achieving their aims in the most effective and efficient 

manner.  I will explain more about that approach, and, relevant to your businesses, efforts 

to tailor regulation so it is appropriate for the size and business model of different 

institutions.  I will also briefly describe pending regulatory changes passed last month by 


 - 2 - 

Congress, which I believe will further tailor regulations for banks, with particular benefit 

to community and regional banks. 

But I want to devote much of my time today to a broader message about the 

connection between these improvements in post-crisis regulation and the fundamental 

purpose of those regulations:  to do what must be done to protect our economy from 

another severe financial crisis.  Banks of all sizes have a shared interest in ensuring that 

regulation is efficient and appropriately tailored to promote a strong, fair, and competitive 

market for financial services.  Likewise, banks have a shared interest in ensuring that 

regulation overall promotes a strong and stable financial system that keeps credit flowing 

to households and businesses in the communities you serve.  

Among the truths revealed by the financial crisis, one of the most important was 

the recognition that the vulnerabilities that had developed in the financial system were 

global in nature and that the problems our institutions and markets faced in the United 

States were inextricably connected to conditions and decisions outside our borders.  

Other governments likewise found that problems in the United States spilled over to their 

financial systems and economies.  To cite just one example, it is well known now that the 

rapid growth of securitization of residential mortgages in the United States was a 

prominent factor driving up home lending and driving down lending standards.  I think it 

is not as well known that a large share of those securities were being created, traded, and 

held by entities outside the United States.   

Some of the most important steps taken since the crisis to make our financial 

system more resilient have involved collecting information, identifying and monitoring 


 - 3 - 

stresses in the global financial system, and establishing and raising international 

standards.   

As I have noted, the improvements the Federal Reserve is making to financial 

regulation here in America, including tailoring, will help level the playing field for banks 

and help ensure you are able to continue to compete and serve your customers.  The 

benefits of this for Utah banks are clear.  But banks in Utah and elsewhere also benefit 

from a strong and stable global financial system, and as history has demonstrated, this in 

turn depends on strong international standards that help level the playing field.  A strong 

and stable financial system depends also on transparency that helps both the private 

sector and regulators detect and deter vulnerabilities that could harm the U.S. economy.   

So I’d also like to talk to you today about one of the important international 

bodies created since the crisis to promote global financial stability, the Financial Stability 

Board (FSB) and tell you why I believe America’s active participation in the FSB is 

important to our nation, and even, as remote as it might seem, relevant to your 

businesses. 

But let me begin with a topic of more immediate interest and offer a brief 

overview of legislation and regulatory action by the Federal Reserve that I know is 

important to you and your institutions.  First, a little context: like our economy, the 

condition of the U.S. banking industry is strong.  First quarter profits for all banks hit a 

new record of $56 billion.  Banks are well capitalized and positioned to increase lending 

to finance investment in a strengthening economy.  Community banks are also doing 

well.  According to Federal Reserve data on more than 5,000 community-based holding 

companies, community banks reported net income of $20.6 billion during 2017, up  


 - 4 - 

4 percent from the year before.  Like larger banks more recently, this result was the 

product of particularly strong loan activity, with recent year-over-year loan growth of  

7.7 percent, which was substantially above the increase last year in the banking industry 

as a whole. 

Turning to recent regulatory developments, the big news, of course, is the 

Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act sponsored by Senator 

Crapo, passed by Congress at the end of May and signed by the President.  Before I get to 

that, let me briefly mention some things the Federal Reserve and other agencies have 

done--in some cases presaging steps taken in the new legislation--to reduce the regulatory 

burden on community and regional banks.  

One supervisory improvement is a Federal Reserve program called Bank Exams 

Tailored to Risk, or the BETR program.  It uses financial metrics to differentiate the level 

of risk between banks before examinations and assist examiners in tailoring examination 

procedures to minimize the regulatory burden for firms that engage in low-risk activities, 

while subjecting higher-risk activities to more testing and review.  Another initiative has 

been to shift a significant amount of the Federal Reserve’s examination activity offsite.   

Additionally, the Federal Reserve, along with other agencies, took action to 

simplify the reporting responsibilities of smaller banks with a new streamlined Call 

Report form in 2017.  Based on feedback from community banks, we and other regulators 

also increased the threshold for requiring an appraisal on commercial real estate loans 

from $250,000 to $500,000.  Looking ahead, the Federal Reserve is developing a revised 

approach to determining “control” under the Bank Holding Company Act that could help 

banks raise capital and facilitate nonbank investments.  


 - 5 - 

I will now discuss the new law, which preserves the most important post-crisis 

reforms for the largest firms while directing the Federal Reserve and other agencies to 

make numerous changes that should reduce the regulatory burden for community and 

regional banks.  On the Volcker rule, the legislation calls for exempting the vast majority 

of banks with $10 billion or less in assets from reporting requirements, which the Federal 

Reserve supported, due to the lack of trading activity that community banks engage in.  

This overtook efforts by the Fed and other regulatory agencies to refine the Volcker rule, 

but the bottom line is that this broad exemption is law and in the process of being 

implemented.  

Another change in the new legislation raises the asset threshold for bank holding 

companies eligible for the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from  

$1 billion to $3 billion.  The law also exempts bank holding companies with $50 billion 

to $100 billion in assets from enhanced prudential standards and exempts banks with less 

than $100 billion in assets from future stress testing.  The lifting of this threshold 

importantly allows the Federal Reserve to tailor its rules for these firms moving forward 

while retaining the ability to protect the safety and soundness of the system. 

I mentioned steps related to Call Report streamlining, and the legislation 

addresses this topic also, allowing reduced Call Report requirements for certain banks 

with less than $5 billion in assets.  For banks that are well managed and well-capitalized, 

the asset threshold was raised for a longer, 18-month examination cycle from $1 billion 

to $3 billion. The legislation would also exempt from an appraisal requirement rural 

properties for loans of less than $400,000, under certain circumstances.  


 - 6 - 

A common theme in the legislation and the Fed’s steps to improve our regulation 

and supervision is tailoring.  As the Fed continues to evaluate the effectiveness and 

efficiency of regulations, I expect tailoring will be a guiding principle.  

Let me now address international efforts to promote financial stability, 

specifically those centered in the Financial Stability Board.   

In the run-up to the crisis, as I’m sure you all know, decades of relative stability in 

the United States had left both the financial industry and government agencies 

complacent about potential threats.  And even though financial crises had occurred during 

that time in some advanced economies, it is fair to say that the United States and other 

nations did not place a high probability on a crisis that could be global in nature.  As a 

result, international coordination and collaboration on financial stability was limited, and 

there was a shortage of detailed and standardized information about financial conditions 

and vulnerabilities in different countries.   

As the crisis descended and the global nature of the problems became clear, the 

United States and other major economies, working through the Group of Twenty nations, 

created the Financial Stability Board to coordinate their efforts to stabilize the global 

financial system, reform international financial regulation, and share information.1  The 

FSB includes central banks, finance ministries and regulators from 24 nations, the 

European Union, and also international organizations such as the International Monetary 

Fund and important global financial standard-setting bodies.  Unlike other global 

organizations, the FSB includes multiple agencies from each government in recognition 

of the fact that financial stability is a responsibility shared across many parts of any 

                                                 
1 The FSB was created in April 2009 and was the successor of a less-formal group known as the Financial 
Stability Forum. See www.fsb.org/about/.

government.  From the United States, the Federal Reserve, the U.S. Treasury Department, 

and the Securities and Exchange Commission are members.   

Some of you may reasonably be wondering, at this point of the speech, how we 

got from rural appraisals in Utah to the Financial Stability Board in Switzerland.  How 

are the conditions in 2008 and 2009 that led to creation of the FSB relevant to community 

banking?  Let us remind ourselves how that global financial crisis and ensuing recession 

looked to communities in Utah and the bankers who serve them.   

Community banks, as we all know, engaged in little of the risky activity that was 

the basis of the crisis.  But few community banks, I think, were unaffected by the 

competitive forces that were unleashed in the years leading up to 2008.  When short-term 

wholesale funding froze up, and securitizing loans became impossible, and Fannie Mae 

and Freddie Mac effectively failed, community banks were affected.  And when your 

customers were hit hard by the crisis, community banks were affected too.  In two years, 

from 2007 to 2009, the unemployment rate in Utah more than tripled.  As it usually does, 

Utah weathered the Great Recession better than most places, but it was still the toughest 

economic times our state has faced in many decades, and of course, this profoundly 

affected banks and their customers. 

While that was occurring, the Federal Reserve and governments in other countries 

affected by the crisis were tackling several challenges in trying to strengthen financial 

regulation and oversight.  One fundamental problem was information, specifically the 

lack of information about risks and vulnerabilities both within and across jurisdictions.  

The Federal Reserve and other U.S. agencies had some tools to help assess prudential 

risks for U.S.-based firms when the crisis hit.  Information sharing about systemic 


 - 8 - 

financial vulnerabilities was more limited, particularly for conditions outside the United 

States.  For one, we did not understand the importance of some financial vulnerabilities 

or had only limited information on them, such as interconnectedness across financial 

firms, and therefore we were unable to share information.  We also failed to appreciate 

the ways in which the shadow banking system that had grown up outside the institutions 

we oversaw had become interconnected with those institutions.  The existing global 

forums for discussion of these issues were considered less important or were focused on 

just one financial sector, and membership was often limited to a handful of industrial 

countries.  We now understand the importance of taking a global view on financial 

vulnerabilities, and we are learning from each other about how to fill the gaps in 

understanding and data that exist. 

An additional challenge that the United States faced, in responding to the crisis 

and establishing more effective oversight and higher standards was the inability to 

enforce such rules in a global financial system without common, more uniform standards.  

If some of the activities threatening financial stability occurred outside the United States 

and in jurisdictions with lower standards, raising standards in the United States would be 

both ineffective in fully stabilizing the financial system, and could put U.S. firms at a 

competitive disadvantage, which would be only an added disincentive to embrace 

effective standards.   

Every nation, of course, seeking to make its financial system more resilient faced 

these same challenges and disincentives, an example of the problem of collective action 

that points nations toward international cooperation.  


 - 9 - 

If the FSB had been in place before the crisis and working on identifying and 

assessing vulnerabilities to financial stability, that may have allowed us to take action at 

an earlier stage, frame our response with more information, and possibly mitigate some 

of the devastating consequences.  I can attest to the FSB’s improvement over the pre-

crisis discussions that took place internationally because during the first Bush 

Administration I was a delegate to the informal and more limited group that preceded the 

FSB.   

An important part of the FSB’s work is to endorse minimum standards in different 

areas; for example, identifying the key attributes of effective resolution planning for 

systemically important firms.  In addition, the FSB is in the early stages of some critical 

work that examines the effects that reforms and standards are having.  Are they doing 

what we intended them to do?  Have there been unintended consequences?  Can we make 

the reforms more efficient; that is can we achieve the same effects while lowering the 

burden on institutions and supervisors? 

Once again, you might be wondering why something like resolution regime-

planning should matter to community bankers.  You might be hoping that I get back to 

the good news I delivered earlier, about steps being taken in Washington to tailor 

regulation and reduce the regulatory burden on community banks.  But, of course, these 

are two sides of the same coin.  Appropriately reducing the regulatory burden for 

community banks is possible when we can get an accurate picture of the risks and 

vulnerabilities in the broader financial system, which Utah’s banks are part of and depend 

on.  Tailoring does not mean abandoning our responsibility to promote a stable financial 

system, but embracing it, assisted by FSB efforts to ensure that reforms are having the 


 - 10 - 

intended effects and supported by the global standards that the FSB and other 

international standard-setting bodies are able to establish and promote. 

In closing, I want to address an issue relevant to any international organization, 

which is sovereignty.  More specifically, we sometimes hear concerns that international 

bodies such as the FSB threaten our sovereignty by imposing rules on the United States, 

which would be a concern.   

Let me be clear: the FSB has no enforcement powers, no legal authority to 

command its members to do anything, and not even authority, as in some international 

organizations, to induce action based on contractual obligations.  The FSB does not 

impose obligations, it addresses problems--problems that are of great importance to the 

United States and which, because of the global nature of the financial system, we cannot 

address alone.  The United States and other governments created the FSB and participate 

in it because it is in our national interests to do so, and that is really the basis of its 

effectiveness.  The United States is not weaker or less independent by participating in the 

FSB or other standard-setting bodies.  On the contrary, when rightly structured our 

participation in these groups makes our financial system significantly stronger by 

ensuring that the U.S. perspective is part of the discussions and reflected in standards 

agreed to.  Our consumers and businesses are more secure and prosperous because the 

FSB helps make sure that all countries are doing their share in promoting financial 

stability and not gaining an unfair advantage.  

Like some other effective organizations, a source of the FSB’s power is that it 

functions by consensus.  That can make reaching decisions more difficult, but it also 

yields decisions that can be truly effective solutions because all participants feel a stake 


 - 11 - 

in them.  It is useful when the credibility and commitment of the decisions are especially 

important, such as when my Fed colleagues and I set monetary policy.  At the FSB, 

relying on consensus helps 68 agencies and other members from two dozen countries 

with different perspectives and agendas come together around our shared interest in a 

stable global financial system.  International negotiations and standard-setting is not the 

best approach to all problems, but in my past experience as a Treasury Department 

official, it is often the best way to tackle problems that are global in scope.  

By actively participating in the FSB and engaging with its members at a high 

level, the United States is supporting high international standards that are equal to those 

in the United States.  Our standards will be most effective when other major economies 

embrace them in a consistent manner.  The goal is to limit the risks of another financial 

crisis and do what we can to promote prosperity and a bright future for the people you 

serve so faithfully in the great state of Utah.
