For more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has served as one of 

the nation’s leading nonpartisan forums for discussion of economic policy issues.  It is an 

honor to appear before you today to speak about the Federal Reserve’s pursuit of 

maximum employment and price stability. 

In December, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target 

range for the federal funds rate, the Federal Reserve’s main policy rate, by 1/4 percentage 

point.  This small step marked the end of an extraordinary seven-year period during 

which the federal funds rate was held near zero to support the recovery from the worst 

financial crisis and recession since the Great Depression.  The Committee’s action 

recognized the considerable progress that the U.S. economy had made in restoring the 

jobs and incomes of millions of Americans hurt by this downturn.  It also reflected an 

expectation that the economy would continue to strengthen and that inflation, while low, 

would move up to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective as the transitory influences of lower 

oil prices and a stronger dollar gradually dissipate and as the labor market improves 

further.  In light of this expectation, the Committee stated in December, and reiterated at 

the two subsequent meetings, that it “expects that economic conditions will evolve in a 

manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate.”1 

In my remarks today, I will explain why the Committee anticipates that only 

gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted in coming years, 

emphasizing that this guidance should be understood as a forecast for the trajectory of 

policy rates that the Committee anticipates will prove to be appropriate to achieve its 

objectives, conditional on the outlook for real economic activity and inflation.

Importantly, this forecast is not a plan set in stone that will be carried out regardless of 

economic developments.  Instead, monetary policy will, as always, respond to the 

economy’s twists and turns so as to promote, as best as we can in an uncertain economic 

environment, the employment and inflation goals assigned to us by the Congress.   

The proviso that policy will evolve as needed is especially pertinent today in light 

of global economic and financial developments since December, which at times have 

included significant changes in oil prices, interest rates, and stock values.  So far, these 

developments have not materially altered the Committee’s baseline--or most likely--

outlook for economic activity and inflation over the medium term.  Specifically, we 

continue to expect further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to our 

2 percent objective over the next two or three years, consistent with data over recent 

months.  But this is not to say that global developments since the turn of the year have 

been inconsequential.  In part, the baseline outlook for real activity and inflation is little 

changed because investors responded to those developments by marking down their 

expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate, thereby putting downward 

pressure on longer-term interest rates and cushioning the adverse effects on economic 

activity.  In addition, global developments have increased the risks associated with that 

outlook.  In light of these considerations, the Committee decided to leave the stance of 

policy unchanged in both January and March.   

I will next describe the Committee’s baseline economic outlook and the risks that 

cloud that outlook, emphasizing the FOMC’s commitment to adjust monetary policy as 

needed to achieve our employment and inflation objectives.

Recent Developments and the Baseline Outlook 

Readings on the U.S. economy since the turn of the year have been somewhat 

mixed.  On the one hand, many indicators have been quite favorable.  The labor market 

has added an average of almost 230,000 jobs a month over the past three months.  In 

addition, the unemployment rate has edged down further, more people are joining the 

workforce as the prospects for finding jobs have improved, and the employment-to-

population ratio has increased by almost 1/2 percentage point.  Consumer spending 

appears to be expanding at a moderate pace, driven by solid income gains, improved 

household balance sheets, and the ongoing effects of the increases in wealth and declines 

in oil prices over the past few years.  The housing market continues its gradual recovery, 

and fiscal policy at all levels of government is now modestly boosting economic activity 

after exerting a considerable drag in recent years.   

On the other hand, manufacturing and net exports have continued to be hard hit 

by slow global growth and the significant appreciation of the dollar since 2014.  These 

same global developments have also weighed on business investment by limiting firms’ 

expected sales, thereby reducing their demand for capital goods; partly as a result, recent 

indicators of capital spending and business sentiment have been lackluster.  In addition, 

business investment has been held down by the collapse in oil prices since late 2014, 

which is driving an ongoing steep decline in drilling activity.  Low oil prices have also 

resulted in large-scale layoffs in the energy sector and adverse spillovers to output and 

employment in industries that support energy production.   

On balance, overall employment has continued to grow at a solid pace so far this 

year, in part because domestic household spending has been sufficiently strong to offset 


 - 4 - 

the drag coming from abroad.  Looking forward however, we have to take into account 

the potential fallout from recent global economic and financial developments, which have 

been marked by bouts of turbulence since the turn of the year.  For a time, equity prices 

were down sharply, oil traded at less than $30 per barrel, and many currencies were 

depreciating against the dollar.  Although prices in these markets have since largely 

returned to where they stood at the start of the year, in other respects economic and 

financial conditions remain less favorable than they did back at the time of the December 

FOMC meeting.  In particular, foreign economic growth now seems likely to be weaker 

this year than previously expected, and earnings expectations have declined.  By 

themselves, these developments would tend to restrain U.S. economic activity.  But those 

effects have been at least partially offset by downward revisions to market expectations 

for the federal funds rate that in turn have put downward pressure on longer-term interest 

rates, including mortgage rates, thereby helping to support spending.  For these reasons, I 

anticipate that the overall fallout for the U.S. economy from global market developments 

since the start of the year will most likely be limited, although this assessment is subject 

to considerable uncertainty. 

All told, the Committee continues to expect moderate economic growth over the 

medium term accompanied by further labor market improvement.  Consistent with this 

assessment, the medians of the individual projections for economic growth, 

unemployment, and inflation made by all of the FOMC participants for our March 

meeting are little changed from December.2  A key factor underlying such modest 

                                                 
2 Specifically, the median projections of real GDP growth in 2016 and 2017 revised down 0.2 percentage 
point and 0.1 percentage point, respectively; the median projections of real GDP growth in 2018 and the 
longer run were unrevised.  The median projection for the unemployment rate in late 2016 was unrevised, 
while the projections for late 2017, late 2018, and the longer run were revised down slightly.  Finally, 


 - 5 - 

revisions is a judgment that monetary policy remains accommodative and will be 

adjusted at an appropriately gradual pace to achieve and maintain our dual objectives of 

maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  Reflecting global economic and financial 

developments since December, however, the pace of rate increases is now expected to be 

somewhat slower.  For example, the median of FOMC participants’ projections for the 

federal funds rate is now only 0.9 percent for the end of 2016 and 1.9 percent for the end 

of 2017, both 1/2 percentage point below the December medians. 

As has been widely discussed, the level of inflation-adjusted or real interest rates 

needed to keep the economy near full employment appears to have fallen to a low level in 

recent years.  Although estimates vary both quantitatively and conceptually, the evidence 

on balance indicates that the economy’s “neutral” real rate--that is, the level of the real 

federal funds rate that would be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy 

was operating near its potential--is likely now close to zero.3  However, the current real 

federal funds rate is even lower, at roughly minus 1-1/4 percentage point, when measured 

using the 12-month change in the core price index for personal consumption expenditures 

                                                 
although the median projection for overall inflation in 2016 was revised down 0.4 percentage point, median 
projections for subsequent years were unrevised; in addition, median projections for core inflation were 
almost unrevised for all years.  For additional information on the Summary of Economic Projections to be 
released with the March 2016 FOMC minutes, see 
www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20160316.htm. 
3 The neutral rate is not directly observable.  However, we intuitively know that it must have run well 
below its historical norm in recent years because otherwise the economy would have expanded at a much 
more rapid pace with the nominal federal funds rate near zero.  As discussed in my December 2, 2015, 
speech to the Economic Club of Washington (Yellen, 2015), empirical evidence supports this intuition.  I 
showed that model-based estimates of the “natural rate,” when the natural rate is defined as the real short-
term interest rate that would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices 
to changes in the economy, are currently close to zero in four macroeconomic models used by Federal 
Reserve staff.  Time series estimates of a different concept of the natural rate that is more similar to the 
neutral rate definition used in this speech, such as Laubach and Williams (2016) and Lubik and Matthes 
(2015), are near historical lows.  See also Johannsen and Mertens (2016) for empirical evidence of a 
decline in the longer-run level of the natural rate, along with measures of the uncertainty attached to 
estimates of its current value.

(PCE), which excludes food and energy.  Thus, the current stance of monetary policy 

appears to be consistent with actual economic growth modestly outpacing potential 

growth and further improvements in the labor market.4 

Looking beyond the near term, I anticipate that growth will also be supported by a 

lessening of some of the headwinds that continue to restrain the U.S. economy, which 

include weak foreign activity, dollar appreciation, a pace of household formation that has 

not kept up with population and income growth and so has depressed homebuilding, and 

productivity growth that has been running at a slow pace by historical standards since the 

end of the recession.  If these headwinds gradually fade as I expect, the neutral federal 

funds rate will also rise, in which case it will, all else equal, be appropriate to gradually 

increase the federal funds rate more or less in tandem to achieve our dual objectives.  

Otherwise, monetary policy would eventually become overly accommodative as the 

economy strengthened.5 

Implicitly, this expectation of fading headwinds and a rising neutral rate is a key 

reason for the FOMC’s assessment that gradual increases in the federal funds rate over 

time will likely be appropriate.  That said, this assessment is only a forecast.  The future 

path of the federal funds rate is necessarily uncertain because economic activity and 

inflation will likely evolve in unexpected ways.  For example, no one can be certain 

about the pace at which economic headwinds will fade.  More generally, the economy 

                                                 
4 Assuming that the current gap between the actual federal funds rate and its neutral value is about 
125 basis points, simulations of the FRB/US model under vector-autoregression-based expectations suggest 
that maintaining this interest rate gap for the next couple of years would lower the unemployment rate 
1/2 percentage point or so below what it otherwise would be if the gap were instead immediately closed.  
Under rational expectations, the predicted effect would be smaller.  For further information, see Brayton, 
Laubach, and Reifschneider (2014). 
5 Of course, any gap between the real federal funds rate and the neutral rate will eventually need to be 
closed in order to stabilize inflation at 2 percent, keep employment at its maximum level, and the economy 
growing in line with its potential rate.

will inevitably be buffeted by shocks that cannot be foreseen.  What is certain, however, 

is that the Committee will respond to changes in the outlook as needed to achieve its dual 

mandate.   

Turning to inflation, here too the baseline outlook is little changed.  In December, 

the FOMC anticipated that inflation would remain low in the near term due to the drag 

from lower prices for energy and imports.  But as those transitory effects faded, the 

Committee expected inflation to move up to 2 percent over the medium term, provided 

the labor market improves further and inflation expectations are stable.  This assessment 

still seems to me to be broadly correct.  PCE prices were up only 1 percent in February 

relative to a year earlier, held down by earlier declines in the price of oil.  In contrast, 

core PCE inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy components, was up 1.7 

percent in February on a 12 month basis, somewhat more than my expectation in 

December.  But it is too early to tell if this recent faster pace will prove durable.  Even 

when measured on a 12-month basis, core inflation can vary substantially from quarter to 

quarter and earlier dollar appreciation is still expected to weigh on consumer prices in the 

coming months.  For these reasons, I continue to expect that overall PCE inflation for 

2016 as a whole will come in well below 2 percent but will then move back to 2 percent 

over the course of 2017 and 2018, assuming no further swings in energy prices or the 

dollar.  This projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation 

remaining reasonably well anchored.  It is still my judgment that inflation expectations 

are well anchored, but as I will shortly discuss, continued low readings for some 

indicators of expected inflation do concern me.

Risks to the Outlook for Real Economic Activity 

Although the baseline outlook has changed little on balance since December, 

global developments pose ongoing risks.  These risks appear to have contributed to the 

financial market volatility witnessed both last summer and in recent months.   

One concern pertains to the pace of global growth, which is importantly 

influenced by developments in China.  There is a consensus that China’s economy will 

slow in the coming years as it transitions away from investment toward consumption and 

from exports toward domestic sources of growth.  There is much uncertainty, however, 

about how smoothly this transition will proceed and about the policy framework in place 

to manage any financial disruptions that might accompany it.  These uncertainties were 

heightened by market confusion earlier this year over China’s exchange rate policy. 

A second concern relates to the prospects for commodity prices, particularly oil.  

For the United States, low oil prices, on net, likely will boost spending and economic 

activity over the next few years because we are still a major oil importer.  But the 

apparent negative reaction of financial markets to recent declines in oil prices may in part 

reflect market concern that the price of oil was nearing a financial tipping point for some 

countries and energy firms.  In the case of countries reliant on oil exports, the result 

might be a sharp cutback in government spending; for energy-related firms, it could entail 

significant financial strains and increased layoffs.  In the event oil prices were to fall 

again, either development could have adverse spillover effects to the rest of the global 

economy. 

If such downside risks to the outlook were to materialize, they would likely slow 

U.S. economic activity, at least to some extent, both directly and through financial market 


 - 9 - 

channels as investors respond by demanding higher returns to hold risky assets, causing 

financial conditions to tighten.  But at the same time, we should not ignore the welcome 

possibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favorable than we now 

expect.  The improvement in the labor market in 2014 and 2015 was considerably faster 

than expected by either FOMC participants or private forecasters, and that experience 

could be repeated if, for example, the economic headwinds we face were to abate more 

quickly than anticipated.  For these reasons, the FOMC must watch carefully for signs 

that the economy may be evolving in unexpected ways, good or bad. 

Risks to the Inflation Outlook 

The inflation outlook has also become somewhat more uncertain since the turn of 

the year, in part for reasons related to risks to the outlook for economic growth.  To the 

extent that recent financial market turbulence signals an increased chance of a further 

slowing of growth abroad, oil prices could resume falling, and the dollar could start rising 

again.  And if foreign developments were to adversely affect the U.S. economy by more 

than I expect, then the pace of labor market improvement would probably be slower, 

which would also tend to restrain growth in both wages and prices.  But even if such 

developments were to occur, they would, in my view, only delay the return of inflation to 

2 percent, provided that inflation expectations remain anchored. 

Unfortunately, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken 

for granted.  During the 1970s, inflation expectations rose markedly because the Federal 

Reserve allowed actual inflation to ratchet up persistently in response to economic 

disruptions--a development that made it more difficult to stabilize both inflation and 

employment.  With considerable effort, however, the FOMC gradually succeeded in 


 - 10 - 

bringing inflation back down to a low and stable level over the course of the 1980s and 

early 1990s.  Since this time, measures of longer-run inflation expectations derived from 

both surveys and financial markets have been remarkably stable, making it easier to keep 

actual inflation relatively close to 2 percent despite large movements in oil prices and 

pronounced swings in the unemployment rate.  

Lately, however, there have been signs that inflation expectations may have 

drifted down.  Market-based measures of longer-run inflation compensation have fallen 

markedly over the past year and half, although they have recently moved up modestly 

from their all-time lows.  Similarly, the measure of longer-run inflation expectations 

reported in the University of Michigan Survey of Consumers has drifted down somewhat 

over the past few years and now stands at the lower end of the narrow range in which it 

has fluctuated since the late 1990s.   

The shifts in these measures notwithstanding, the argument that inflation 

expectations have actually fallen is far from conclusive.  Analysis carried out at the Fed 

and elsewhere suggests that the decline in market-based measures of inflation 

compensation has largely been driven by movements in inflation risk premiums and 

liquidity concerns rather than by shifts in inflation expectations.6  In addition, the longer-

run measure of inflation expectations from the Michigan Survey has historically 

exhibited some sensitivity to fluctuations in current gasoline prices, which suggests that 

this measure may be an unreliable guide to movements in trend inflation under current 

circumstances.7  Moreover, measures of longer-run expected inflation gleaned from 

                                                 
6 For related background discussions, see Bauer and Rudebusch (2015), Abrahams and others (2012 [rev. 
2015), and D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014). 
7 Similarly, a monthly survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows a noticeable 
decline over the past two years in household expectations for inflation three years ahead.  However, these 


 - 11 - 

surveys of business and financial economists, such as those reported in the Survey of 

Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip survey, and the Survey of Primary Dealers, have 

largely moved sideways in the past year or two.  Taken together, these results suggest 

that my baseline assumption of stable expectations is still justified.  Nevertheless, the 

decline in some indicators has heightened the risk that this judgment could be wrong.  If 

so, the return to 2 percent inflation could take longer than expected and might require a 

more accommodative stance of monetary policy than would otherwise be appropriate.8   

Despite the declines in some indicators of expected inflation, we also need to 

consider the opposite risk that we are underestimating the speed at which inflation will 

return to our 2 percent objective.  Economic growth here and abroad could turn out to be 

stronger than expected, and, as the past few weeks have demonstrated, oil prices can rise 

as well as fall.  More generally, economists’ understanding of inflation is far from 

perfect, and it would not be all that surprising if inflation was to rise more quickly than 

expected over the next several years.  For these reasons, we must continue to monitor 

incoming wage and price data carefully. 

Monetary Policy Implications 

Let me now turn to the implications for monetary policy of this assessment of the 

baseline outlook and associated risks.   

                                                 
readings on shorter-term expectations may also be influenced by current gasoline prices.  Moreover, 
readings from this survey are only available since 2013, making it difficult to determine the significance of 
these results. 
8 Another risk to the inflation forecast, although one that has not changed appreciably since the turn of the 
year, is that the Committee may have overestimated the longer-run rate of unemployment consistent with 
inflation stabilizing at 2 percent.  Currently, the median of FOMC participants’ estimates of this rate is 
4.8 percent.  However, this longer-run rate cannot be estimated precisely, and so it could be appreciably 
higher or lower--although given low readings on wages in recent years, I think the latter possibility is more 
likely than the former.  If so, a lower level of unemployment might be needed to fully eliminate slack in the 
labor market, drive faster wage growth, and return inflation to our 2 percent objective. 


 - 12 - 

The FOMC left the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged in January 

and March, in large part reflecting the changes in baseline conditions that I noted earlier.  

In particular, developments abroad imply that meeting our objectives for employment and 

inflation will likely require a somewhat lower path for the federal funds rate than was 

anticipated in December. 

Given the risks to the outlook, I consider it appropriate for the Committee to 

proceed cautiously in adjusting policy.  This caution is especially warranted because, 

with the federal funds rate so low, the FOMC’s ability to use conventional monetary 

policy to respond to economic disturbances is asymmetric.  If economic conditions were 

to strengthen considerably more than currently expected, the FOMC could readily raise 

its target range for the federal funds rate to stabilize the economy.  By contrast, if the 

expansion was to falter or if inflation was to remain stubbornly low, the FOMC would be 

able to provide only a modest degree of additional stimulus by cutting the federal funds 

rate back to near zero.9 

One must be careful, however, not to overstate the asymmetries affecting 

monetary policy at the moment.  Even if the federal funds rate were to return to near zero, 

the FOMC would still have considerable scope to provide additional accommodation.  In 

particular, we could use the approaches that we and other central banks successfully 

employed in the wake of the financial crisis to put additional downward pressure on long-

term interest rates and so support the economy--specifically, forward guidance about the 

                                                 
9 Research suggests that, all else being equal, increased uncertainty and greater downside risk in the vicinity 
of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates call for greater gradualism under optimal policy than 
would be the case if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.  This phenomenon is 
known as “policy attenuation” in the economic literature.  For a discussion, see, for example, Adam and 
Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), Evans and others (2015), and Gust, Johannsen, and Lopez-Salido (2015).

future path of the federal funds rate and increases in the size or duration of our holdings 

of long-term securities.10  While these tools may entail some risks and costs that do not 

apply to the federal funds rate, we used them effectively to strengthen the recovery from 

the Great Recession, and we would do so again if needed.11 

Of course, economic conditions may evolve quite differently than anticipated in 

the baseline outlook, both in the near term and over the longer run.  If so, as I emphasized 

earlier, the FOMC will adjust monetary policy as warranted.  As our March decision and 

the latest revisions to the Summary of Economic Projections demonstrate, the Committee 

has not embarked on a preset course of tightening.  Rather, our actions are data 

dependent, and the FOMC will adjust policy as needed to achieve its dual objectives. 

Financial market participants appear to recognize the FOMC’s data-dependent 

approach because incoming data surprises typically induce changes in market 

expectations about the likely future path of policy, resulting in movements in bond yields 

that act to buffer the economy from shocks.  This mechanism serves as an important 

“automatic stabilizer” for the economy.  As I have already noted, the decline in market 

expectations since December for the future path of the federal funds rate and 

accompanying downward pressure on long-term interest rates have helped to offset the 

contractionary effects of somewhat less favorable financial conditions and slower foreign 

growth.  In addition, the public’s expectation that the Fed will respond to economic 

                                                 
10 With regard to the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, the FOMC could increase its size by resuming large-
scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities.  Alternatively, 
the FOMC could increase the duration of the Federal Reserve’s holdings without expanding the size of its 
portfolio by selling assets with relatively short residual maturities and buying equal amounts of assets with 
relatively long residual maturities.  Studies suggest that either action would reduce the term premiums 
embedded in longer-term interest rates considerably. 
11 For an overview of the macroeconomic effects of the Federal Reserve’s unconventional policies after the 
financial crisis, see Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) and the references therein.  For a discussion 
of the costs and benefits of these tools, see English, Lopez-Salido, and Tetlow (2015).

disturbances in a predictable manner to reduce or offset their potential harmful effects 

means that the public is apt to react less adversely to such shocks--a response which 

serves to stabilize the expectations underpinning hiring and spending decisions.12   

Such a stabilizing effect is one consequence of effective communication by the 

FOMC about its outlook for the economy and how, based on that outlook, policy is 

expected to evolve to achieve our economic objectives.  I continue to strongly believe 

that monetary policy is most effective when the FOMC is forthcoming in addressing 

economic and financial developments such as those I have discussed in these remarks, 

and when we speak clearly about how such developments may affect the outlook and the 

expected path of policy.  I have done my best to do so today, in the time you have kindly 

granted me. 


                                                 
12 That said, market expectations are not always well aligned with the Committee’s baseline outlook for the 
federal funds rate. Market participants may hold different views about the economic outlook and the 
associated risks and at times may be confused about the FOMC’s strategy.  In such situations, the 
Committee must do what it believes is appropriate while clearly explaining the rationale for its actions.
