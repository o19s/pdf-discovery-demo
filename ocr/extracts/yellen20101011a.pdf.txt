Macroprudential Supervision and Monetary Policy in the Post-crisis World 


Remarks by 

Janet L. Yellen 

Vice Chair 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics 

Denver, Colorado 




October 11, 2010


 

 Thank you for that very kind introduction.  When I look at the roster of previous 

recipients of the Adam Smith Award, it is very august company indeed.  It’s a 

tremendous honor to appear before you this year, and I am very grateful.1  

 I should stress that my remarks represent my own views and not necessarily those 

of my Federal Reserve colleagues.  Today I would like to cover a subject that is of 

surpassing importance for economic policy:  the implications of financial market 

excesses for the supervision of the financial system, and beyond that, for the formulation 

of monetary policy.  

Just two years ago, we lived through an almost unimaginable catastrophe--the 

near collapse of a global financial system that many economists had come to believe was 

impervious to the sort of panic that could bring on a worldwide recession.  The prevailing 

view was that modern economic policymaking, and central banking in particular, had 

mastered the management of the business cycle, and that the application of modern risk-

management tools had greatly increased the stability of the financial system.  Financial 

markets were not held to be perfect, of course.  But they were viewed as self-correcting 

systems that tended to return to a stable equilibrium before they could inflict widespread 

damage on the real economy.  

That view lies in tatters today as we look at tens of millions of unemployed and 

the trillions of dollars of lost output and lost wealth around the world.  These events 

should have convinced any doubters that our financial system is vulnerable to the kinds 

of catastrophic breakdowns that can wreck the overall economy.  An inescapable 

conclusion is that a first-order priority must be to engineer a stronger, more robust system

Francisco, for assistance in preparing these remarks.

of financial regulation and supervision--one capable of identifying and managing 

excesses before they lead to crises.  We must find a way to contain these threats without 

putting a straitjacket on financial innovation and risk-taking.  I don’t claim this is an easy 

task, but it is an essential one. 

Lessons from the Crisis  

It is now clear that our system of regulation and supervision was fatally flawed.  

Despite volumes of research on financial market metrics and weighty position papers on 

financial stability, the fact is that we simply didn’t understand some of the most 

dangerous systemic threats.  Looking back, I believe the regulatory community was lulled 

into complacency by a combination of a Panglossian worldview and benign experience.  

The notion that financial markets should be as free as possible from regulatory fetters had 

evolved into the conviction that those markets could, to a very considerable extent, police 

themselves.  Meanwhile, things went along so well for so long that the common belief 

came to be that nothing could go disastrously wrong.  Over a period of decades, the 

financial system was tested repeatedly--the Latin American debt crisis, the savings and 

loan crisis, the Asian crisis, the failure of Long-Term Capital Management, and the stock 

market crashes of the late 1980s and early 2000s.  With each crisis, policymakers rolled 

up their sleeves and beat back the systemic threat.  The levees held.  Despite these 

financial market ups and downs, economies in the United States and other parts of the 

world performed very well.  We appeared to have entered a new era of stability.  We 

even gave it a name:  the Great Moderation.  We were left with the mirage of a system 

that we thought was invulnerable to shock, a financial Maginot Line that we believed 

couldn’t be breached.  We now know that this sense of invincibility was mere hubris.

To understand what went wrong, I refer you to Hyman Minsky’s path-breaking 

work on speculative financial booms and busts.2  As Minsky showed, success can lead to 

excess, and excess to ruin.  The Great Moderation saw a progressive growth of credit and 

extension of risk, which came to a head in the mortgage market.  Credit flowed freely and 

cheaply, and households and financial institutions alike took on greater risk, borrowing to 

the hilt.  House prices soared off the charts.  Financial innovators found increasingly 

exotic ways of packaging loans for investors.  Securities became so opaque that few 

understood their risks.  Originators sold mortgages to investors whose due diligence 

consisted of glancing at ratings.  The financial system became increasingly complex, 

interconnected, and hyperleveraged.   

When housing prices plunged, the value of real-estate-related assets on the 

balance sheets of financial institutions, both in the traditional and shadow banking 

sectors, collapsed.  Not only were many of those institutions highly leveraged, they had 

also relied heavily on short-term borrowing to acquire those assets.  The combination of 

leverage and short maturity funding left them perilously vulnerable to runs.  The result 

was panic and market breakdowns on an unimaginable scale, bringing us frighteningly 

close to a meltdown of the global financial system and a second Great Depression.   

Thankfully, that depression never occurred.  Governments and central banks 

around the world took extraordinary action to prevent complete collapse.  But what we 

did get was bad enough--the deepest and most prolonged recession in generations.  And 

the recovery has been agonizingly slow, held back, in part, by the ongoing efforts of 

overleveraged households and financial institutions to repair their balance sheets.  These

events demonstrate both the natural tendency of the financial system to cycle through 

booms and busts and the potential, absent adequate supervision and regulation, for 

breakdowns in the financial system to threaten the global economy.   

Financial market participants can be bipolar--prone to fads, manias, myopia, 

panics, and depression; driven by short-term gain; and easily caught up in the madness of 

crowds.  One’s belief about the beliefs of others is critical, like Keynes’s example of a 

beauty contest.3  In addition, the structure of compensation and incentives in the financial 

sector created strong motives for excessive risk-taking, especially during boom years.  

Methods of modern risk management may have intensified the cycle because of their 

reliance on metrics such as value at risk that are highly sensitive to recent performance, 

especially volatility.  In good times, volatility declined, and value at risk along with it.  

This pattern generated a pro-cyclical willingness to take on risk and leverage, amplifying 

and propagating the boom and bust cycle.  The vicious cycle of a collapse of confidence, 

asset fire sales, evaporation of liquidity, and a deleveraging free fall was the mirror image 

of the manic mortgage market that preceded it. 

 To avoid a repeat of these events, it is essential that we change the landscape of 

supervision and regulation.  The landmark legislation recently passed by the Congress, 

the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), is 

designed to do just that.  It requires regulators to contain risks to the financial system 

before they erupt into crises.  And it creates a structure to collect data, identify emerging 

threats to financial stability, and formulate policies to contain these risks.

Within this structure, the Federal Reserve will play an important role.  We will 

supervise all systemically important institutions and, jointly with other regulators in the 

new Financial Stability Oversight Council, establish stricter prudential standards for such 

firms.  We will help ensure the safety of financial market utilities that are critical to our 

payment, clearing, and settlement systems.  And we will actively support the council’s 

mission to identify and address emerging risks to financial stability.  At the same time, 

though, we must take care to preserve incentives for innovation and reasonable risk-

taking.  We must remain prudent, while avoiding an overly strict approach that unduly 

impedes financial intermediation and stifles capital formation.  

Vigilance to threats of systemic financial risk must also inform the conduct of 

monetary policy.  We have seen that the eruption of a financial crisis can have severe 

economic consequences, compromising the ability of a central bank to attain its primary 

macroeconomic objectives.  Monetary policymakers should also be aware that the 

decisions they make in pursuit of price stability and full employment could, in some 

circumstances, affect the development of systemic risk.  For example, if compensation 

incentives in the financial sector are misaligned, low interest rates might heighten the 

ability and desire of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk.   

Our goal should be to deploy an enhanced arsenal of regulatory tools to address 

systemic risk, making the financial system far more robust.  That way, monetary policy 

can concentrate on its long-standing goals of price stability and maximum employment.  

Supervision and regulation must serve as the first and main line of defense in addressing 

systemic risk.  We have at our disposal a tool kit of regulatory instruments that are well 

adapted for this purpose.  Monetary policy cannot be a primary instrument for systemic

risk management.  First, it has its own macroeconomic goals on which it must maintain a 

sharp focus.  Second, it is too blunt an instrument for dealing with systemic risk.  All the 

same, I cannot unequivocally rule out the possibility that situations could emerge in 

which monetary policy should play some role in reining in risk-taking behavior.  I will 

return to this point later. 

In the remainder of my remarks, I will discuss key issues that must be resolved 

before an effective policy regime for the containment of systemic risk can be established.  

First, we must understand the sources of systemic risk and design surveillance practices 

that enable us to detect threats to financial stability early on.  Second, we must develop a 

tool kit of supervisory policy instruments--so-called macroprudential policies--and 

guidelines on how and when to deploy them.  And third, we must strive to avoid 

situations in which macroprudential and monetary policies are working at cross-purposes, 

given that macroprudential policies affect macroeconomic performance and that 

monetary policy may affect risk-taking incentives.   

All of these issues raise complex questions of design and implementation.  

Interesting parallels may be drawn, however, between the design issues we face in 

macroprudential policy and those we have grappled with in conducting monetary policy.  

These parallels include the appropriate roles of rules versus discretion, the need for 

policies that are robust in addressing uncertainty, and the assignment problem, all of 

which I will discuss later.  The fertile field of monetary policy research may therefore 

offer lessons that can fruitfully be applied to managing systemic risk.

Systemic Risk:  Sources and Surveillance 

At its most basic level, systemic risk stems from the possibility that some event or 

sequence of events could result in severe impairment of the financial sector’s ability to 

provide credit in the economy.  At their most extreme, such events can trigger panicky 

attempts to withdraw credit, creating runs that lead to failures of important financial 

institutions and, ultimately, systemic collapse.  

If policymakers are to detect emerging threats to the financial system, we must 

understand the determinants of systemic risk and develop appropriate metrics for 

measuring it.  Economists have long studied these issues, and the recent crisis has 

intensified research on the subject.  This work points to several key elements in the 

buildup of risks in the financial system.  Let me mention three factors that current 

research suggests are critical.   

One factor is the accumulation in the financial sector of very high levels of risk 

and leverage, along with excessive reliance on unstable short-term funding.  The 

emergence of such behavior among the largest and most interconnected financial 

institutions is particularly dangerous, since these institutions are linchpins in our financial 

system and their failure could cause significant damage to large numbers of 

counterparties and the system as a whole, as the examples of Lehman Brothers and 

American International Group demonstrate.  However, a buildup of leverage and growing 

maturity mismatches are also worrisome when they occur more broadly in the financial 

system. 

A second element is a high positive correlation of risk exposures across 

institutions.  A wide array of commercial banks, investment banks, and other financial 


- 8 - 
 

 
 

institutions held mortgages, mortgage-backed securities, or positions in mortgage-related 

derivatives.  The result was the massive vulnerability of the financial system to a collapse 

of housing prices.  What seemed like moderate risks taken by individual institutions 

ultimately led to an enormous risk to the system as a whole.   

A third element is the extraordinary interconnectedness and complexity within the 

financial system.  The intricate and opaque web of connections among financial players 

multiplies the dangers of contagion in the form of lost confidence, frozen liquidity, fire 

sales, and domino effects.4  A key factor in this channel of systemic risk is the 

institutional arrangements in payment, clearing, and settlement systems.  For example, 

weaknesses in the market infrastructure for repurchase agreements, or repos, and over-

the-counter derivatives intensified the crisis.5   

Systemic risk reflects the confluence of factors that may grow slowly over years. 

Therefore, surveillance must look at a variety of indicators and be forward looking, 

considering the paths of factors that influence such risk for years to come.  To facilitate 

timely recognition of the emergence of systemic risk, we should design quantifiable 

indicators related to the three elements I just outlined:  risk buildup at systemically 

important institutions and within the financial sector more broadly, positive correlations 

of risk among financial market participants, and interconnectedness among those 

participants.

Systemic risk surveillance will demand Herculean efforts by the regulatory 

agencies and the Office of Financial Research created by the new legislation.  I see 

parallels between the way we take the pulse of the economy when considering monetary 

policy decisions and the way we should monitor and evaluate systemic risk when 

formulating macroprudential policies.  In assessing the economy, we collect and analyze 

a myriad of data.  In practice, though, we regard certain metrics as most critical, such as 

gross domestic product, employment and unemployment, and inflation.  Similarly, in risk 

surveillance, we will gather an array of data on risk spreads, credit flows and volumes, 

asset prices, debt and leverage, markets, and institutions, including detailed, often 

proprietary, microdata on balance sheets and data from such markets as those for over-

the-counter derivatives and repos.  Nonetheless, surveillance is likely to concentrate on 

key factors in the buildup of systemic risk such as the ones I identified:  the accumulation 

of credit and funding risk on the balance sheets of systemically important institutions and 

throughout the financial system, the correlation of risk among financial market 

participants, and the extent of counterparty exposures. 

Of course, we must also keep a close eye on broad credit and asset market 

conditions.  One strand of surveillance will involve watching variations of risk and term 

spreads of bonds and other securities relative to historical norms.  Narrow risk spreads 

and risk premiums may be a harbinger of excessive risk-taking by investors.  Another 

strand will focus more directly on measuring credit flows and exposures to credit risk.  If 

overall credit growth is extraordinarily rapid, it may be a sign that financial institutions 

are taking greater risks onto their balance sheets.  Because of financial system 

complexity, leverage is impossible to measure perfectly.  Still, real-time indicators of the 


- 10 - 
 

 
 

leverage of financial intermediaries would help identify where we are in a credit cycle.  

For example, we can look at the marginal leverage of new borrowing by examining data 

on collateral haircuts.  We may also monitor data on repo market activity and haircuts to 

spot vulnerabilities relating to maturity mismatches.  This information can be 

crosschecked against firm- and sector-level data on credit risk exposure.  

One aspect of systemic risk surveillance that has garnered a great deal of attention 

is the identification of asset price bubbles.  Bubbles present systemic danger when major 

financial institutions use leverage to finance investment in risky assets that they hold on 

their balance sheets.  The systemic risk is multiplied when the asset bubble is 

accompanied by a credit bubble that fuels highly leveraged investment.6  So a top priority 

of systemic risk surveillance must be to assess whether asset price movements suggest 

the presence of a bubble and identify at an early stage those that might be particularly 

dangerous.  In practice, of course, we will have highly uncertain notions of when 

excesses evolve into bubbles.  Near the end of a bubble, it’s pretty clear that something is 

amiss.  But by then it’s too late to do much about it. 

We will also need to monitor the cross-sectional correlations of firms’ risk 

exposures.7  In addition, we need information on counterparty exposures through 

derivatives and other financial instruments.  Finally, further development of financial

7 A number of promising measures of measuring systemic risk that take into account the correlations of 
firms’ strategies have recently been developed.  For example, the CoVaR approach aims to measure the 
marginal contribution of a financial institution to systemic risk, where systemic risk is measured by the 
value at risk of all firms together; see Tobias Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier (2009), “CoVaR,” Staff

sector stress testing, building on the tests carried out in the United States in 2009 and in 

Europe this year, will provide valuable information about the ability of the financial 

system to weather significant economic or financial shocks.  We should refine the stress-

testing methodology as we develop a more sophisticated understanding of institution-

level systemic risk factors.  These enhancements can be carried out by the quantitative 

surveillance unit that we have already established in our supervision of the largest 

financial institutions to better integrate macroprudential considerations with regular 

supervisory practice.   

Qualitative information on credit will complement the quantitative evidence.  The 

Fed recently introduced the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing 

Terms, adding to the information collected from the existing commercial bank Senior 

Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, a survey on credit supply and 

demand.8 

Systemic risk surveillance is both a science and an art:  science in that we will 

analyze closely a wide range of data that research shows to be diagnostic, and art in that 

we will have to exercise judgment about when excesses become so dangerous that action 

is required.  The Fed and other regulators in the United States and abroad have made 

important progress in developing systemic risk indicators.  Still, we must recognize the 

inherent difficulty in forecasting crises and acknowledge the failure of past risk-

monitoring efforts.  Moreover, we must be mindful of the inadequacy of indicators that 

focus too specifically on the markets and channels that transmitted the crisis of 2007 and 

2008.  Like Tolstoy’s unhappy families, every financial crisis is a crisis in its own way.

For that reason, we need a flexible approach that combines science and art, and 

judgmentally weighs information from all indicators.   

Macroprudential Policy Implementation 

Refining our ability to identify systemic threats is well and good.  But when we 

detect a threat, what will we do about it?  This question brings me to the tools and 

implementation of macroprudential policies.  The first tool is information to help focus 

attention in policy circles, and among investors and the public, on looming systemic 

risks.  The detailed financial stability reports published by the International Monetary 

Fund and a number of central banks are intended to serve this purpose.9  And the 

Financial Stability Oversight Council created under the Dodd-Frank Act is charged with 

preparing such a report once a year.  

Admittedly, most such reports failed to identify the mechanisms behind the recent 

crisis.  And even when vulnerabilities were identified and warning bells sounded, they 

were often greeted with yawns, as anyone who remembers the phrase “irrational 

exuberance” can testify.  Those who sounded the alarms were seen as killjoys who 

refused to join the party.  Words are important, but clearly they are not enough.  We need 

strong policies to back them up.  We need macroprudential policymakers ready to take 

away the punch bowl when the party is getting out of hand.  We know that market 

participants won’t take kindly when limits are set precisely in those markets that are most 

exuberant, the ones in which they are making big money.  During the late stages of the

housing boom, more than a few financial institution chief executive officers dismissed 

the warnings of their own risk managers with a wave of the hand.  

So what should be the main tools of macroprudential supervision?  Many of them 

are similar to those of microprudential policy.  They take the form of restrictions or 

incentives related to financial firms’ balance sheets.  Still, macroprudential policies differ 

from purely microprudential approaches in that they are intended to protect the financial 

system as a whole and, by extension, the broader economy.  Macroprudential policies 

will be aimed at countering the pro-cyclical nature of credit and leverage, leaning against 

the wind when systemic risk is accumulating.  In addition, they will seek to stem risks 

related to interconnections and spillovers in the financial system.  

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is playing a key role in designing 

this new regulatory regime as part of the Basel III initiative.  And, under Federal Reserve 

leadership, initiatives to implement macroprudential supervision are well under way in 

the United States.  Policymakers here and abroad agree that macroprudential policy must 

include requirements to hold more and higher-quality capital.  And capital requirements 

must be reformulated to reduce the pro-cyclicality of credit and leverage.  Financial 

institutions may be required to build capital buffers in good times, which they can run 

down in bad times, thereby limiting credit growth during booms and mitigating credit 

contraction in downturns.  Banks may also be required to have, in addition to their 

standard equity buffers, contingent capital in the form of debt that is convertible to equity 

if they experience significant losses.  This additional capital would protect them from 

insolvency during busts while allowing them to benefit from debt finance in boom times.  

U.S. regulators have also been charged with developing heightened prudential standards 


- 14 - 
 

 
 

for systemically important institutions to constrain risk-taking by those firms whose 

failures would pose the greatest systemic risk.  One approach could involve imposing 

penalties or restrictions on financial firms based on factors such as the correlation of their 

strategies with those of other firms or by limiting risk exposure to individual 

counterparties.  

Policies are on the drawing board to ensure that institutions avoid undue reliance 

on short-term debt and have adequate liquidity in market downturns.  Such requirements 

would diminish the risk of the shortfalls and hoarding that could fuel a credit market 

meltdown.  Policymakers might additionally put in place policies to discourage 

overreliance on short-term debt among investors more broadly through, for example, 

regulations on repo haircuts.  To address unsustainable real estate price run-ups, some 

countries have chosen to cap maximum loan-to-value ratios on home loans.  Such an 

approach deserves serious consideration.  My expectation is that policies such as these 

will restrict dangerous pro-cyclical movements in debt and leverage, diminish the extent 

of maturity mismatches and the potential for runs, and discourage unsustainable asset 

price appreciation.  Importantly, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators have also 

taken steps to ensure that the financial institutions we supervise enforce compensation 

policies that control incentives for excessive pro-cyclical risk-taking.   

Macroprudential supervision must be particularly attentive to risks that could 

impair the plumbing of the financial system--that is, the payments, clearing, and 

settlements systems--where breakdowns would relay and amplify systemic risk.  

Importantly, the Dodd-Frank Act significantly increases the trading of derivatives on 


- 15 - 
 

 
 

exchanges and their clearing through central counterparties.10  Because clearinghouses 

are themselves subject to risk from counterparties and are important linchpins in the 

financial system, they must be regulated to ensure that they operate safely. 

Since the implementation of macroprudential supervision is a work in progress, I 

want to highlight several important design considerations.  The first relates to the 

appropriate balance between fixed rules and discretion--a question familiar from 

monetary and fiscal policy.  In both cases, we have learned that fixed rules offer distinct 

advantages.  In fiscal policy, automatic stabilizers have proven helpful in mitigating the 

amplitude of cyclical fluctuations.  They trigger fiscal support when needed in a timely 

and predictable way.  In the realm of monetary policy, the Fed and other central banks 

commonly vary policy in a manner that researchers and market participants find 

predictable and systematic.  Indeed, guidance from policy rules is increasingly used in 

actual decisionmaking since rule-based recommendations create a sensible starting point 

for deliberations.  Rule-like behavior also aligns the expectations of markets and 

policymakers so that policy is transmitted quickly and effectively to the economy.  

Nevertheless, neither fiscal nor monetary policymakers rely on fixed rules alone. 

Discretionary fiscal policy has been helpful, even essential, in some instances in 

responding to economic fluctuations resulting from large shocks.  Similarly, in the realm 

of monetary policy, the Fed and other central banks certainly don’t slavishly follow 

prescriptions from any rule.  They retain discretion to deviate from such prescriptions 

when responding to severe shocks, unusually strong headwinds, or significant 

asymmetric risks.   

                                                            
10 See Duffie and others, “Policy Perspectives,” in note 5, for a discussion of these issues. 


- 16 - 
 

 
 

In the implementation of macroprudential supervision, I believe it will be 

similarly advantageous to put in place a system of controls in which fixed rules play an 

important role while a place is preserved for the discretionary judgments of regulators.  

Fixed rules will diminish the need for policymakers to make the difficult decision to take 

away the punch bowl.  Moreover, if discretionary macroprudential policy interventions 

are deferred until a boom is well under way, the macroeconomic spillovers could prove 

difficult for monetary policy to offset.   

For these reasons, a stronger system of prudential controls designed to mitigate 

the buildup of systemic risk must be put into place, a system that will incorporate 

mechanisms to automatically counter pro-cyclical behavior.  All the same, discretionary 

interventions will inevitably play a part in macroprudential supervision.  For one thing, 

it’s important to keep in mind that financial institutions have been very adept at gaming 

rule-based systems.  And, over time, there is always an incentive for risky financial 

activities to migrate outside the perimeter of supervision and regulation, even if that 

perimeter is moving.  That’s precisely what happened prior to the mortgage crisis, when 

leverage ballooned in the shadow banking system and investment banks and some 

nonbanks became principal participants in credit derivatives markets.  Furthermore, the 

financial system will evolve in ways that preclude any wholly rule-based system from 

countering all emerging systemic threats.  Discretionary macroprudential interventions 

are certain to be needed to address dangerous developments, and judgment must play a 

role. 

A second consideration in macroprudential supervision relates to the need for 

robust policies.  This concern derives from the observation that we still have a lot to learn 


- 17 - 
 

 
 

about the behavior of financial institutions and their effects on systemic risk and the real 

economy.  Our ability to model the channels by which disruptions in credit and finance 

affect the real economy and the ways these effects feed back into the banking and 

financial systems is getting more sophisticated.11  But our understanding of the key 

channels, their quantitative importance, and the effects of our policies remain incomplete 

at best.  It is therefore important that we implement policies that are likely to succeed in 

mitigating systemic risk in a future crisis regardless of the precise triggers and 

transmission channels.  A rich monetary policy literature demonstrates that simple rules 

result in good, even excellent, performance when policymakers face uncertainty about the 

structure of the economy and the source of economic shocks.12  This conclusion may 

apply to macroprudential supervision as well.  

A third consideration in the design of the macroprudential supervision relates to 

the need for extensive international cooperation.  If the United States were to go it alone 

with tough policies, we could see our financial institutions flee in a race to the bottom.  

But I’m convinced that won’t happen.  We are working closely with our international 

counterparts to develop coherent and comprehensive approaches, aided by the Basel

Finally, we must not forget that macroprudential policies will entail some costs as 

well as benefits.  The magnitude of these costs remains a subject of debate.  But, as with 

all forms of regulation, we must find the right balance between overly strict supervision 

and laissez faire.  I don’t know exactly where on the continuum that balance lies.  But I 

do know that, before the crisis, we had veered disastrously too far in the direction of 

laissez faire, with consequences we know too well. 

Interaction with Monetary Policy 

One of the most challenging issues relating to systemic risk management is the 

appropriate interactions between macroprudential and monetary policy.  To what extent, 

if at all, should monetary policy be used to mitigate systemic risk?  And to what extent, if 

at all, should monetary policy be coordinated with macroprudential supervision?  These 

issues are the subject of intense debate among policymakers across the globe.  Of course, 

the question of whether monetary policy should lean against asset price bubbles is hardly 

new.14  What has changed is the sense of urgency surrounding this and related questions.

I noted previously--and it is now commonly accepted--that monetary policy can 

affect systemic risk through a number of channels.15  First, monetary policy has a direct 

effect on asset prices for the obvious reason that interest rates represent the opportunity 

costs of holding assets.  Indeed, an important element of the monetary transmission 

mechanism works through the asset price channel.  In theory, an increase in asset prices 

induced by a decline in interest rates should not cause asset prices to keep escalating in 

bubble-like fashion.  But if bubbles do develop, perhaps because of an onset of excessive 

optimism, and especially if the bubble is financed by debt, the result may be a buildup of 

systemic risk.  Second, recent research has identified possible linkages between monetary 

policy and leverage among financial intermediaries.16  It is conceivable that 

accommodative monetary policy could provide tinder for a buildup of leverage and 

excessive risk-taking in the financial system.   

Macroprudential interventions may also have macroeconomic spillovers.  For 

example, research suggests that rigorous enforcement of supervisory standards for capital 

following the real estate-related loan losses of the early 1990s may have slowed the 

economy’s recovery from the recession.  Today, we all understand the need for more 

stringent bank capital and liquidity requirements to stem systemic risk.  But, with high 

unemployment in so many economies, the new Basel III agreement recognizes the 

desirability of a phase in period for these standards.   The implementation of tighter 

standards over a multi-year period should mitigate the concern that the macroprudential

policies we are putting in place to control systemic risk will unduly restrict the 

availability of credit, thereby retarding economic recovery.  In this case, as it should, the 

implementation of macroprudential policy is taking account of spillovers that monetary 

policy, at least now, cannot easily offset. 

Some would argue that the conduct of macroprudential and monetary policy 

should be closely coordinated, even integrated, because of the spillovers I described.17  

Indeed, the logic of this argument has led some observers to conclude that both 

macroprudential and monetary policy should be assigned to the central bank.18  As I 

noted, the Dodd-Frank Act assigned the Federal Reserve an important role in the conduct 

of macroprudential supervision, and for good reasons.  We have long experience in 

supervision, broad knowledge of financial markets, and an understanding of the linkages 

between financial markets and the economy.  In addition, the insights derived from our 

supervisory role benefit the conduct of monetary policy.  But the pursuit of 

macroprudential supervision under the new legislation involves other regulatory agencies 

beside the Fed, and the new Financial Stability Oversight Council will play an important 

role.  And, of course, the Fed will keep sole responsibility for the conduct of monetary 

policy, retaining its independence.  There are important reasons for this approach.  One is 

that systemic risk surveillance will benefit from the perspectives of regulators with 

different windows on the financial system, all participating in the oversight council.

Second, the principle of central bank independence in the conduct of monetary policy is 

widely accepted as vital to achieving maximum employment and price stability.   

Fortunately, it is perfectly possible to attain good outcomes even if monetary 

policy and macroprudential policy are carried out separately and independently, and the 

goals of each are pursued using entirely separate tool kits.  This conclusion is an 

application of the assignment problem made familiar by Robert Mundell and others who 

analyzed monetary and fiscal policy.19  A key insight from that literature is that 

satisfactory results can be attained without policy coordination, even though fully optimal 

policy generally calls for coordination when spillovers occur.  Of course, it is necessary 

for monetary policy to take into account any macroeconomic effects resulting from 

macroprudential policy and vice versa.  

This separate-assignments approach to formulating macroprudential and monetary 

policy has merit both in theory and practice.  But I want to be careful not to push the 

argument for separation too far.  I noted, for example, that situations may arise in which 

the Federal Reserve, in its conduct of monetary policy, might not be able to fully offset 

the macroeconomic effects of macroprudential interventions.  This scenario could happen 

because of the zero bound on interest rates or monetary policy lags.  In such 

circumstances, it makes sense for macroprudential policy to take macroeconomic effects 

into account.  By the same token, I would not want to argue that it is never appropriate 

for monetary policy to take into account its potential effect on financial stability.  

Regulation is imperfect.  Financial imbalances may emerge even if we strengthen 

macroprudential oversight and control.  Some day in the future, it is possible that

macroprudential regulators might let down their guard.  In such situations, if emerging 

threats to financial stability become evident, monetary policy could be faced with 

difficult tradeoffs.  My hope is that such situations will remain largely theoretical and, in 

practice, be exceedingly rare.  

Overall, I am encouraged by the progress we are making in developing the new 

regulatory framework.  Still, macroprudential supervision is a work in progress, and we 

must humbly recognize that we have a lot to learn. 

Challenges 

It’s important to be realistic about the challenges that lie ahead.  By its nature, 

policy designed to manage systemic risk fights dangers that may never lead to crises.  We 

may sometimes be like the boy who cried, “Wolf!”--and the villagers may not be pleased 

about being rousted from their beds.  Right now, we are still suffering from the shock of 

an epic financial disaster.  The climate for macroprudential policymaking is relatively 

favorable.  But memories will fade, as they always have before, and future policymakers 

may face harsh criticism.  They will need to make difficult and potentially costly 

judgment calls, relying on imperfect real-time information.  In this regard, it’s worth 

recalling Paul Samuelson’s quip that the stock market has predicted nine of the past 

five recessions.  Will future regulators and monetary policymakers be accused of bursting 

10 of the past 2 asset bubbles? 

These dangers are real.  But the events we’ve recently lived through make it clear 

that we have no choice but to embark on this road.  We’ve all been asked, “Didn’t you 

see this mortgage disaster coming?  Why didn’t you do anything about it?”  Our task now 

is to implement intelligent policies to contain future bubbles and credit binges, and to

make sure that those that do occur inflict a lot less damage on the economy.  Next time I 

hope we can say, “We did see it coming, and we did something about it.”   

Thank you very much.
