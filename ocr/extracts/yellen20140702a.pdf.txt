The 2014 Michel Camdessus Central Banking Lecture 
International Monetary Fund 

 
Washington, D.C. 


July 2, 2014 
 



It is an honor to deliver the inaugural Michel Camdessus Central Banking 

Lecture.  Michel Camdessus served with distinction as governor of the Banque de France 

and was one of the longest-serving managing directors of the International Monetary 

Fund (IMF).  In these roles, he was well aware of the challenges central banks face in 

their pursuit of price stability and full employment, and of the interconnections between 

macroeconomic stability and financial stability.  Those interconnections were apparent in 

the Latin American debt crisis, the Mexican peso crisis, and the East Asian financial 

crisis, to which the IMF responded under Camdessus’s leadership.  These episodes took 

place in emerging market economies, but since then, the global financial crisis and, more 

recently, the euro crisis have reminded us that no economy is immune from financial 

instability and the adverse effects on employment, economic activity, and price stability 

that financial crises cause.   

The recent crises have appropriately increased the focus on financial stability at 

central banks around the world.  At the Federal Reserve, we have devoted substantially 

increased resources to monitoring financial stability and have refocused our regulatory 

and supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of systemic risk.  There have also been calls, 

from some quarters, for a fundamental reconsideration of the goals and strategy of 

monetary policy.  Today I will focus on a key question spurred by this debate:  How 

should monetary and other policymakers balance macroprudential approaches and 

monetary policy in the pursuit of financial stability? 

In my remarks, I will argue that monetary policy faces significant limitations as a 

tool to promote financial stability:  Its effects on financial vulnerabilities, such as 

excessive leverage and maturity transformation, are not well understood and are less 


 - 2 - 

direct than a regulatory or supervisory approach; in addition, efforts to promote financial 

stability through adjustments in interest rates would increase the volatility of inflation and 

employment.  As a result, I believe a macroprudential approach to supervision and 

regulation needs to play the primary role.  Such an approach should focus on “through the 

cycle” standards that increase the resilience of the financial system to adverse shocks and 

on efforts to ensure that the regulatory umbrella will cover previously uncovered 

systemically important institutions and activities.  These efforts should be complemented 

by the use of countercyclical macroprudential tools, a few of which I will describe.  But 

experience with such tools remains limited, and we have much to learn to use these 

measures effectively. 

I am also mindful of the potential for low interest rates to heighten the incentives 

of financial market participants to reach for yield and take on risk, and of the limits of 

macroprudential measures to address these and other financial stability concerns.  

Accordingly, there may be times when an adjustment in monetary policy may be 

appropriate to ameliorate emerging risks to financial stability.  Because of this possibility, 

and because transparency enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy, it is crucial that 

policymakers communicate their views clearly on the risks to financial stability and how 

such risks influence the appropriate monetary policy stance.  I will conclude by briefly 

laying out how financial stability concerns affect my current assessment of the 

appropriate stance of monetary policy. 

Balancing Financial Stability with Price Stability:  Lessons from the Recent Past 

When considering the connections between financial stability, price stability, and 

full employment, the discussion often focuses on the potential for conflicts among these 




 - 3 - 

objectives.  Such situations are important, since it is only when conflicts arise that 

policymakers need to weigh the tradeoffs among multiple objectives.  But it is important 

to note that, in many ways, the pursuit of financial stability is complementary to the goals 

of price stability and full employment.  A smoothly operating financial system promotes 

the efficient allocation of saving and investment, facilitating economic growth and 

employment.  A strong labor market contributes to healthy household and business 

balance sheets, thereby contributing to financial stability.  And price stability contributes 

not only to the efficient allocation of resources in the real economy, but also to reduced 

uncertainty and efficient pricing in financial markets, which in turn supports financial 

stability. 

Despite these complementarities, monetary policy has powerful effects on risk 

taking.  Indeed, the accommodative policy stance of recent years has supported the 

recovery, in part, by providing increased incentives for households and businesses to take 

on the risk of potentially productive investments.  But such risk-taking can go too far, 

thereby contributing to fragility in the financial system.1  This possibility does not 

obviate the need for monetary policy to focus primarily on price stability and full 

employment--the costs to society in terms of deviations from price stability and full 

employment that would arise would likely be significant.  I will highlight these potential 

costs and the clear need for a macroprudential policy approach by looking back at the 

vulnerabilities in the U.S. economy before the crisis.  I will also discuss how these 

1 The possibility that periods of relative economic stability may contribute to risk-taking and the buildup of 
imbalances that may unwind in a painful manner is often linked to the ideas of Hyman Minsky (see 
Hyman P. Minsky (1992), “The Financial Instability Hypothesis,” Working Paper 74 (Annandale-on-
Hudson, N.Y.:  Jerome Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, May), 
www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp74.pdf).   For a recent example of an economic model that tries to explore 
these ideas, see, for example, Markus K. Brunnermeier and Yuliy Sannikov (2014), “A Macroeconomic 
Model with a Financial Sector,” American Economic Review, vol. 104 (February), pp. 379-421.

vulnerabilities might have been affected had the Federal Reserve tightened monetary 

policy in the mid-2000s to promote financial stability.   

Looking Back at the Mid-2000s 

Although it was not recognized at the time, risks to financial stability within the 

United States escalated to a dangerous level in the mid-2000s.  During that period, 

policymakers--myself included--were aware that homes seemed overvalued by a number 

of sensible metrics and that home prices might decline, although there was disagreement 

about how likely such a decline was and how large it might be.  What was not 

appreciated was how serious the fallout from such a decline would be for the financial 

sector and the macroeconomy.  Policymakers failed to anticipate that the reversal of the 

house price bubble would trigger the most significant financial crisis in the United States 

since the Great Depression because that reversal interacted with critical vulnerabilities in 

the financial system and in government regulation.   

In the private sector, key vulnerabilities included high levels of leverage, 

excessive dependence on unstable short-term funding, weak underwriting of loans, 

deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management, and the use of exotic financial 

instruments that redistributed risk in nontransparent ways.   

In the public sector, vulnerabilities included gaps in the regulatory structure that 

allowed some systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs) and markets to escape 

comprehensive supervision, failures of supervisors to effectively use their existing 

powers, and insufficient attention to threats to the stability of the system as a whole. 

It is not uncommon to hear it suggested that the crisis could have been prevented 

or significantly mitigated by substantially tighter monetary policy in the mid-2000s.  At 




 - 5 - 

the very least, however, such an approach would have been insufficient to address the full 

range of critical vulnerabilities I have just described.  A tighter monetary policy would 

not have closed the gaps in the regulatory structure that allowed some SIFIs and markets 

to escape comprehensive supervision; a tighter monetary policy would not have shifted 

supervisory attention to a macroprudential perspective; and a tighter monetary policy 

would not have increased the transparency of exotic financial instruments or ameliorated 

deficiencies in risk measurement and risk management within the private sector. 

Some advocates of the view that a substantially tighter monetary policy may have 

helped prevent the crisis might acknowledge these points, but they might also argue that a 

tighter monetary policy could have limited the rise in house prices, the use of leverage 

within the private sector, and the excessive reliance on short-term funding, and that each 

of these channels would have contained--or perhaps even prevented--the worst effects of 

the crisis. 

A review of the empirical evidence suggests that the level of interest rates does 

influence house prices, leverage, and maturity transformation, but it is also clear that a 

tighter monetary policy would have been a very blunt tool:  Substantially mitigating the 

emerging financial vulnerabilities through higher interest rates would have had sizable 

adverse effects in terms of higher unemployment.  In particular, a range of studies 

conclude that tighter monetary policy during the mid-2000s might have contributed to a 

slower rate of house price appreciation.  But the magnitude of this effect would likely 

have been modest relative to the substantial momentum in these prices over the period; 

hence, a very significant tightening, with large increases in unemployment, would have 




 - 6 - 

been necessary to halt the housing bubble.2  Such a slowing in the housing market might 

have constrained the rise in household leverage, as mortgage debt growth would have 

been slower.  But the job losses and higher interest payments associated with higher 

interest rates would have directly weakened households’ ability to repay previous debts, 

suggesting that a sizable tightening may have mitigated vulnerabilities in household 

balance sheets only modestly.3 

Similar mixed results would have been likely with regard to the effects of tighter 

monetary policy on leverage and reliance on short-term financing within the financial 

sector.  In particular, the evidence that low interest rates contribute to increased leverage 

and reliance on short-term funding points toward some ability of higher interest rates to 

lessen these vulnerabilities, but that evidence is typically consistent with a sizable range 

2 For a discussion of this issue encompassing experience across a broad range of advanced economies in the 
2000s, including the United States, see Jane Dokko, Brian M. Doyle, Michael T. Kiley, Jinill Kim, Shane 
Sherlund, Jae Sim, and Skander Van Den Heuvel (2011), “Monetary Policy and the Global Housing 
Bubble,” Economic Policy, vol. 26 (April), pp. 233-83.  Igan and Loungani (2012) highlight how interest 
rates are an important, but far from the most important, determinant of housing cycles across countries (see 
Deniz Igan and Prakash Loungani (2012), “Global Housing Cycles,” IMF Working Paper Series 
WP/12/217 (Washington:  International Monetary Fund, August), 
www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=26229.0).  Bean and others (2010), examining the 
tradeoffs between unemployment, inflation, and stabilization of the housing market in the United Kingdom, 
imply that reliance on monetary policy to contain a housing boom may be too costly in terms of other 
monetary policy goals (see Charles Bean, Matthias Paustian, Adrian Penalver, and Tim Taylor (2010), 
“Monetary Policy after the Fall,” paper presented at “Macroeconomic Challenges:  The Decade Ahead,” a 
symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., 
August 26-28, www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2010/2010-08-23-bean.pdf).  Saiz (2014) suggests 
that about 50 percent of the variation in house prices during the 2000s boom can be explained by low 
interest rates, and finds that it was the remaining, “non-fundamental” component that subsequently 
collapsed--that is, the interest rate component was not a primary factor in what Saiz terms “the bust” (see 
Albert Saiz (2014), “Interest Rates and Fundamental Fluctuations in Home Values,” paper presented at the 
Public Policy and Economics Spring 2014 Workshops, hosted by the Harris School of Public Policy, 
University of Chicago, April 8, 
http://harrisschool.uchicago.edu/sites/default/files/SAIZ%20FUNDAMENTALS1_0.pdf). 
3 The notion that tighter monetary policy may have ambiguous effects on leverage or repayment capacity is 
illustrated in, for example, Anton Korinek and Alp Simsek (2014), “Liquidity Trap and Excessive 
Leverage,” NBER Working Paper Series 19970 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic 
Research, March).

of quantitative effects or alternative views regarding the causal channels at work.4  

Furthermore, vulnerabilities from excessive leverage and reliance on short-term funding 

in the financial sector grew rapidly through the middle of 2007, well after monetary 

policy had already tightened significantly relative to the accommodative policy stance of 

2003 and early 2004.  In my assessment, macroprudential policies, such as regulatory 

limits on leverage and short-term funding, as well as stronger underwriting standards, 

represent far more direct and likely more effective methods to address these 

vulnerabilities.5 

Recent International Experience 

Turning to recent experience outside the United States, a number of foreign 

economies have seen rapidly rising real estate prices, which has raised financial stability 

concerns despite, in some cases, high unemployment and shortfalls in inflation relative to 

the central bank’s inflation target.6  These developments have prompted debate on how to 

4 See, for example, Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2010), “Liquidity and Leverage,” Journal of 
Financial Intermediation, vol. 19 (July), pp. 418-37; and Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin (2011), 
“Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Economics,” in Benjamin Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., 
Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3A (San Diego, Ca.:  Elsevier), pp. 601-50.  For a study 
emphasizing how changes in the response of monetary policy to financial vulnerabilities would likely 
change the relationship between monetary policy and financial vulnerabilities, see Oliver de Groot (2014), 
“The Risk Channel of Monetary Policy,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 10 (June), pp. 115-
60, www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb14q2a6.pdf. 
5 This evidence and experience suggest that a reliance on monetary policy as a primary tool to address the 
broad range of vulnerabilities that emerged in the mid-2000s would have had uncertain and limited effects 
on risks to financial stability.  Such uncertainty does not imply that a modestly tighter monetary policy may 
not have been marginally helpful.  For example, some research suggests that financial imbalances that 
became apparent in the mid-2000s may have signaled a tighter labor market and more inflationary pressure 
than would have been perceived solely from labor market conditions and overall economic activity.  Hence, 
such financial imbalances may have called for a modestly tighter monetary policy through the traditional 
policy lens focused on inflationary pressure and economic slack.  See, for example, David M. Arseneau and 
Michael Kiley (2014), “The Role of Financial Imbalances in Assessing the State of the Economy,” FEDS 
Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April 18),

best balance the use of monetary policy and macroprudential tools in promoting financial 

stability. 

For example, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom have expressed a 

willingness to use monetary policy to address financial stability concerns in unusual 

circumstances, but they have similarly concluded that macroprudential policies should 

serve as the primary tool to pursue financial stability.  In Canada, with inflation below 

target and output growth quite subdued, the Bank of Canada has kept the policy rate at or 

below 1 percent, but limits on mortgage lending were tightened in each of the years from 

2009 through 2012, including changes in loan-to-value and debt-to-income caps, among 

other measures.7  In contrast, in Norway and Sweden, monetary policy decisions have 

been influenced somewhat by financial stability concerns, but the steps taken have been 

limited.  In Norway, policymakers increased the policy interest rate in mid-2010 when 

they were facing escalating household debt despite inflation below target and output 

below capacity, in part as a way of “guarding against the risk of future imbalances.”8  

Similarly, Sweden’s Riksbank held its policy rate “slightly higher than we would have 

done otherwise” because of financial stability concerns.9  In both cases, macroprudential 

actions were also either taken or under consideration.

In reviewing these experiences, it seems clear that monetary policymakers have 

perceived significant hurdles to using sizable adjustments in monetary policy to contain 

financial stability risks.  Some proponents of a larger monetary policy response to 

financial stability concerns might argue that these perceived hurdles have been 

overblown and that financial stability concerns should be elevated significantly in 

monetary policy discussions.  A more balanced assessment, in my view, would be that 

increased focus on financial stability risks is appropriate in monetary policy discussions, 

but the potential cost, in terms of diminished macroeconomic performance, is likely to be 

too great to give financial stability risks a central role in monetary policy decisions, at 

least most of the time. 

If monetary policy is not to play a central role in addressing financial stability 

issues, this task must rely on macroprudential policies.  In this regard, I would note that 

here, too, policymakers abroad have made important strides, and not just those in the 

advanced economies.  Emerging market economies have in many ways been leaders in 

applying macroprudential policy tools, employing in recent years a variety of restrictions 

on real estate lending or other activities that were perceived to create vulnerabilities.10  

Although it is probably too soon to draw clear conclusions, these experiences will help 

inform our understanding of these policies and their efficacy. 

Promoting Financial Stability through a Macroprudential Approach 

If macroprudential tools are to play the primary role in the pursuit of financial 

stability, questions remain on which macroprudential tools are likely to be most effective, 

10 For a discussion, see Min Zhu (2014), “Era of Benign Neglect of House Price Booms Is Over,” IMF

booms-is-over.

what the limits of such tools may be, and when, because of such limits, it may be 

appropriate to adjust monetary policy to “get in the cracks” that persist in the 

macroprudential framework.11 

In weighing these questions, I find it helpful to distinguish between tools that 

primarily build through-the-cycle resilience against adverse financial developments and 

those primarily intended to lean against financial excesses.12   

Building Resilience 

Tools that build resilience aim to make the financial system better able to 

withstand unexpected adverse developments.  For example, requirements to hold 

sufficient loss-absorbing capital make financial institutions more resilient in the face of 

unexpected losses.  Such requirements take on a macroprudential dimension when they 

are most stringent for the largest, most systemically important firms, thereby minimizing 

the risk that losses at such firms will reverberate through the financial system.  Resilience 

against runs can be enhanced both by stronger capital positions and requirements for 

sufficient liquidity buffers among the most interconnected firms.  An effective resolution 

regime for SIFIs can also enhance resilience by better protecting the financial system 

from contagion in the event of a SIFI collapse.  Further, the stability of the financial 

system can be enhanced through measures that address interconnectedness between 

financial firms, such as margin and central clearing requirements for derivatives 

transactions.  Finally, a regulatory umbrella wide enough to cover previous gaps in the 

11 These questions have been explored in, for example, International Monetary Fund (2013), The 
Interaction of Monetary and Macroprudential Policies (Washington:  IMF, January 29), 
www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/012913.pdf. 
12 The IMF recently discussed tools to build resilience and lean against excesses (and provided a broad 
overview of macroprudential tools and their interaction with other policies, including monetary policy); see

www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/061013b.pdf. 





 - 11 - 

regulation and supervision of systemically important firms and markets can help prevent 

risks from migrating to areas where they are difficult to detect or address. 

In the United States, considerable progress has been made on each of these fronts.  

Changes in bank capital regulations, which will include a surcharge for systemically 

important institutions, have significantly increased requirements for loss-absorbing 

capital at the largest banking firms.  The Federal Reserve’s stress tests and 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review process require that large financial 

institutions maintain sufficient capital to weather severe shocks, and that they 

demonstrate that their internal capital planning processes are effective, while providing 

perspective on the loss-absorbing capacity across a large swath of the financial system.  

The Basel III framework also includes liquidity requirements designed to mitigate 

excessive reliance by global banks on short-term wholesale funding.   

Oversight of the U.S. shadow banking system also has been strengthened.  The 

new Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated some nonbank financial firms 

as systemically important institutions that are subject to consolidated supervision by the 

Federal Reserve.  In addition, measures are being undertaken to address some of the 

potential sources of instability in short-term wholesale funding markets, including 

reforms to the triparty repo market and money market mutual funds--although progress in 

these areas has, at times, been frustratingly slow.   

Additional measures should be taken to address residual risks in the short-term 

wholesale funding markets.  Some of these measures--such as requiring firms to hold 

larger amounts of capital, stable funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-

term wholesale funding--would likely apply only to the largest, most complex 




 - 12 - 

organizations.  Other measures--such as minimum margin requirements for repurchase 

agreements and other securities financing transactions--could, at least in principle, apply 

on a marketwide basis.  To the extent that minimum margin requirements lead to more 

conservative margin levels during normal and exuberant times, they could help avoid 

potentially destabilizing procyclical margin increases in short-term wholesale funding 

markets during times of stress. 

Leaning Against the Wind 

At this point, it should be clear that I think efforts to build resilience in the 

financial system are critical to minimizing the chance of financial instability and the 

potential damage from it.  This focus on resilience differs from much of the public 

discussion, which often concerns whether some particular asset class is experiencing a 

“bubble” and whether policymakers should attempt to pop the bubble.  Because a 

resilient financial system can withstand unexpected developments, identification of 

bubbles is less critical.  

Nonetheless, some macroprudential tools can be adjusted in a manner that may 

further enhance resilience as risks emerge.  In addition, macroprudential tools can, in 

some cases, be targeted at areas of concern.  For example, the new Basel III regulatory 

capital framework includes a countercyclical capital buffer, which may help build 

additional loss-absorbing capacity within the financial sector during periods of rapid 

credit creation while also leaning against emerging excesses.  The stress tests include a 

scenario design process in which the macroeconomic stresses in the scenario become 

more severe during buoyant economic expansions and incorporate the possibility of 

highlighting salient risk scenarios, both of which may contribute to increasing resilience 




 - 13 - 

during periods in which risks are rising.13  Similarly, minimum margin requirements for 

securities financing transactions could potentially vary on a countercyclical basis so that 

they are higher in normal times than in times of stress.   

Implications for Monetary Policy, Now and in the Future 

In light of the considerable efforts under way to implement a macroprudential 

approach to enhance financial stability and the increased focus of policymakers on 

monitoring emerging financial stability risks, I see three key principles that should guide 

the interaction of monetary policy and macroprudential policy in the United States. 

First, it is critical for regulators to complete their efforts at implementing a 

macroprudential approach to enhance resilience within the financial system, which will 

minimize the likelihood that monetary policy will need to focus on financial stability 

issues rather than on price stability and full employment.  Key steps along this path 

include completion of the transition to full implementation of Basel III, including new 

liquidity requirements; enhanced prudential standards for systemically important firms, 

including risk-based capital requirements, a leverage ratio, and tighter prudential buffers 

for firms heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding; expansion of the regulatory 

umbrella to incorporate all systemically important firms; the institution of an effective, 

cross-border resolution regime for systemically important financial institutions; and 

consideration of regulations, such as minimum margin requirements for securities 

financing transactions, to limit leverage in sectors beyond the banking sector and SIFIs.

Second, policymakers must carefully monitor evolving risks to the financial 

system and be realistic about the ability of macroprudential tools to influence these 

developments.  The limitations of macroprudential policies reflect the potential for risks 

to emerge outside sectors subject to regulation, the potential for supervision and 

regulation to miss emerging risks, the uncertain efficacy of new macroprudential tools 

such as a countercyclical capital buffer, and the potential for such policy steps to be 

delayed or to lack public support.14  Given such limitations, adjustments in monetary 

policy may, at times, be needed to curb risks to financial stability.15 

These first two principles will be more effective in helping to address financial 

stability risks when the public understands how monetary policymakers are weighing 

such risks in the setting of monetary policy.  Because these issues are both new and 

complex, there is no simple rule that can prescribe, even in a general sense, how 

monetary policy should adjust in response to shifts in the outlook for financial stability.  

As a result, policymakers should clearly and consistently communicate their views on the 

stability of the financial system and how those views are influencing the stance of 

monetary policy.  

To that end, I will briefly lay out my current assessment of financial stability risks 

and their relevance, at this time, to the stance of monetary policy in the United States.  In 

recent years, accommodative monetary policy has contributed to low interest rates, a flat 

14 For a related discussion, see Elliott, Feldberg, and Lehnert, “The History of Cyclical Macroprudential 
Policy in the United States.” 
15 Adam and Woodford (2013) present a model in which macroprudential policies are not present and 
housing prices experience swings for reasons not driven by “fundamentals.”  In this context, adjustments in 
monetary policy in response to house price booms--even if such adjustments lead to undesirable inflation or 
employment outcomes--are a component of optimal monetary policy.  See Klaus Adam and Michael 
Woodford (2013), “Housing Prices and Robustly Optimal Monetary Policy,” working paper, June 29,

yield curve, improved financial conditions more broadly, and a stronger labor market.  

These effects have contributed to balance sheet repair among households, improved 

financial conditions among businesses, and hence a strengthening in the health of the 

financial sector.  Moreover, the improvements in household and business balance sheets 

have been accompanied by the increased safety of the financial sector associated with the 

macroprudential efforts I have outlined.  Overall, nonfinancial credit growth remains 

moderate, while leverage in the financial system, on balance, is much reduced.  Reliance 

on short-term wholesale funding is also significantly lower than immediately before the 

crisis, although important structural vulnerabilities remain in short-term funding markets.   

Taking all of these factors into consideration, I do not presently see a need for 

monetary policy to deviate from a primary focus on attaining price stability and 

maximum employment, in order to address financial stability concerns.  That said, I do 

see pockets of increased risk-taking across the financial system, and an acceleration or 

broadening of these concerns could necessitate a more robust macroprudential approach.  

For example, corporate bond spreads, as well as indicators of expected volatility in some 

asset markets, have fallen to low levels, suggesting that some investors may 

underappreciate the potential for losses and volatility going forward.  In addition, terms 

and conditions in the leveraged-loan market, which provides credit to lower-rated 

companies, have eased significantly, reportedly as a result of a “reach for yield” in the 

face of persistently low interest rates.  The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller 

of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued guidance 

regarding leveraged lending practices in early 2013 and followed up on this guidance late 

last year.  To date, we do not see a systemic threat from leveraged lending, since broad 




 - 16 - 

measures of credit outstanding do not suggest that nonfinancial borrowers, in the 

aggregate, are taking on excessive debt and the improved capital and liquidity positions at 

lending institutions should ensure resilience against potential losses due to their 

exposures.  But we are mindful of the possibility that credit provision could accelerate, 

borrower losses could rise unexpectedly sharply, and that leverage and liquidity in the 

financial system could deteriorate.  It is therefore important that we monitor the degree to 

which the macroprudential steps we have taken have built sufficient resilience, and that 

we consider the deployment of other tools, including adjustments to the stance of 

monetary policy, as conditions change in potentially unexpected ways. 

Conclusion 

In closing, the policy approach to promoting financial stability has changed 

dramatically in the wake of the global financial crisis.  We have made considerable 

progress in implementing a macroprudential approach in the United States, and these 

changes have also had a significant effect on our monetary policy discussions.  An 

important contributor to the progress made in the United States has been the lessons we 

learned from the experience gained by central banks and regulatory authorities all around 

the world.  The IMF plays an important role in this evolving process as a forum for 

representatives from the world’s economies and as an institution charged with promoting 

financial and economic stability globally.  I expect to both contribute to and learn from 

ongoing discussions on these issues.
