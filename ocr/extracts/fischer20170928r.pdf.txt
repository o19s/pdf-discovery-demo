Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

at

“20 Years On,” a conference sponsored by

the Bank of England

London, England

Revised version: October 12, 2017

Vice Chairman Fischer updated his remarks to elaborate on topics raised at the Bank of 
England conference for which the speech was originally prepared.


It is a pleasure to speak at this commemoration of 20 years of Bank of England 

monetary policy independence.  In my remarks today, I will consider how central 

banking in the United Kingdom and the United States has evolved in response to the 

challenges of recent years.  I will address a limited set of topics and will have time to 

touch only briefly on each.1

These remarks are divided into three parts.  In the first part, I will discuss several 

aspects of aggregate monetary policy:  central bank independence, policy transparency, 

and policy tools.  In the second part, I consider differences between the approaches of the 

two banks to their lender-of-last-resort function.  And, third, I will close with brief 

reflections on the central bank’s responsibility for financial stability.

Revisiting Goal Independence versus Instrument Independence 

We start by considering a central bank that influences economic activity only 

through its influence over the general level of interest rates.2 More than two decades ago, 

Guy Debelle and I offered two terms--goal independence and instrument independence--

to describe such a central bank’s degree of independence.  Our definitions were as 

follows:  “A central bank has goal independence when it is free to set the final goals of 

monetary policy. . . .  A bank that has instrument independence is free to choose the 

means by which it seeks to achieve its goals.”3 In May 1997, the Bank of England

Market Committee.

policy tools will be considered in the latter parts of this presentation.

achieved instrument independence--something the Federal Reserve had already long 

had.4

Under the new law, the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), 

rather than the Treasury, set the policy interest rate.  Inflation targeting, which began in 

the United Kingdom in 1992, continued under the new system and was codified in the 

Bank of England Act of 1998.5 The MPC was given an explicit numerical inflation 

target, corresponding to effective price stability, alongside an implied stabilization goal 

for real economic activity.6 Consequently, the Bank of England from 1997 had the 

combination that Debelle and I advocated:  instrument independence but not goal 

independence.

We also judged that the vagueness of the Federal Reserve’s statutory objectives 

meant that the Federal Reserve “has considerable goal independence.”7 Today both the 

FOMC and the MPC have a numerical inflation goal--2 percent.  However, this 

numerical goal is not specified in legislation in either country.  In the United Kingdom, 

the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets the MPC’s inflation target: currently 2 percent per 

4 U.S. monetary policy independence in the post-World War II era dates at least from the Federal 
Reserve/Treasury Accord of 1951.  See Eichengreen and Garber (1991). I discussed Federal Reserve 
independence in detail in Fischer (2015a).
5 See the text of the act in Bank of England (2015a).  (Since 1998, the U.K. Parliament has made a number 
of amendments to the Bank of England Act 1998--among them a change, in 2016, to the frequency of MPC 
meetings, from monthly to eight times a year.  See Bank of England (2017a).)
6 From the start of inflation targeting in the United Kingdom in 1992, it was made clear that the authorities, 
when faced with a situation in which inflation was different from the target rate, would generally not seek 
to restore inflation to target as quickly as possible.  Rather, they typically would opt for a policy that sought 
to bring inflation back to target gradually, without unnecessary destabilization of real output.  See Leigh-
Pemberton (1992) and Bernanke and others (1999, pp. 156-57).  This approach has continued in the MPC 
era, as discussed later.  It is an approach consistent with the MPC’s remit in the Bank of England Act 1998 
to achieve the inflation target through policies consistent with the economic policy of the U.K. government, 
“including its objectives for growth and employment.”

year for the U.K. consumer price index.8 In the United States, in the FOMC’s Statement 

on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, first issued in 2012 and discussed 

annually, Committee participants have judged that the longer-run inflation objective that 

corresponds to the Federal Reserve’s mandate is a rate of 2 percent per year, as measured 

by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures.9

In practice there is little difference between the policy goals of the two central 

banks, or between the variables that are targeted.  But there is a subtle difference between 

them in terms of who sets the inflation target.  To date, that difference has not generated 

any major divergence between the approaches to monetary policy of the two central 

banks.

Although much has changed in central banking since the 1990s, the case for 

instrument independence and against goal independence remains sound. The case against 

goal independence is that it is not appropriate in a democracy: goals should reflect the 

preferences of society at large and should not be determined by unelected officials.  

The goals of monetary policy should be set by the central government, as is the 

case in both the United States and the United Kingdom.  We all know what the goals of 

the Bank of England and the Fed are: For both, the goals are stability of the price level 

and full employment. Although there is a hint of a lexicographic ordering in favor of the 

rate of inflation in the Bank of England’s mandate, the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate 

unambiguously places equal weight on both goals.  Across the world, there seems to be a 

8 For the most recent statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the inflation target to be pursued by 
the MPC, see Hammond (2017).
9 See Federal Open Market Committee (2017).  See Bernanke (2012) for testimony discussing the longer-
run objective shortly after it was announced.  Bernanke (2015, p. 528) indicated that the FOMC’s 
announcement of the 2 percent longer-run objective was preceded by consultation between himself and 
congressional leaders.  In Fischer (2015a), I took the explicit 2 percent longer-run objective as the means 
by which the FOMC had made its legislated price stability goal operational.

preference for inflation either to be the only goal variable or to be lexicographically 

emphasized over unemployment.  But I do not regard that difference as very significant.  

There is no central bank that--in Mervyn King’s terminology--is an “inflation nutter.”10

Instrument independence is necessary because, without it, the central bank is 

unable to set the stance of monetary policy that it believes to be most consistent with 

achievement of the statutory mandate.  That said, there are, to be sure, degrees of 

instrument independence, and one can easily envisage central banks with considerable 

instrument independence whose actions on their instruments are constrained by law or by 

decisions by the treasury.  For example, in a country that has committed its central bank 

to enforce an exchange rate band (with the exchange rate free to move within the band),

the central bank will not be fully instrument independent, though it may have a 

substantial amount of independence with respect to the precise settings of the policy 

interest rate and other monetary tools.  

Historically, central banks were frequently created to finance public spending.  

However, these banks--such as those in Sweden and the United Kingdom--were later 

sometimes given their operational independence in part to create a greater separation of 

monetary policy from fiscal policy--in particular, in order to ensure that they would not 

be vulnerable to pressure to finance the government budget (that is, to monetize public 

spending). Around the world, the fear of the central bank losing its ability to meet its 

price stability goal may well have been the prime reason for governments to implement 

instrument independence.11

10 See King (1997, p. 89).
11 For further discussion, see, for example, Bernanke (2010), Debelle and Fischer (1994, p. 217), and 
Fischer (1994, pp 262, 290-91).  Initially, the argument was that the central bank was needed to prevent 


- 5 -

Fundamentally, however, central bank instrument independence is desirable 

because monetary policy is an esoteric and complicated art or science, involving 

technical judgments that have economy-wide and often long-lasting consequences: A

separate institution is needed to manage and take responsibility for monetary policy.

Central banks have over the years--in some cases over a few centuries--amassed an 

expertise and developed a character that makes them the natural candidates to perform 

the functions expected of such institutions.  As the Governor of the Riksbank has 

observed, the most important skill and reputation that a central bank needs is one of 

reliability.12 That is, both the central government and the general public should be 

confident that their central bank can be relied on to deliver a stable price level and close 

to full employment, along with financial stability.  If such independent institutions did 

not exist, we would have to invent them; if they exist and perform well, the country is 

blessed; and if they exist and perform badly, they need to be reformed--by a change in the 

laws by which they are governed, by changes in their structure, or by changes in 

personnel--and sometimes all of the above.  

Transparency, Accountability, and Communications

In a paper written for the Bank of England’s tercentenary, I considered how an 

instrument-independent central bank might conduct itself.13 My discussion noted that an 

independent central bank should adhere to the “principle of accountability to the public of 

inflation from becoming too high; now, the argument is couched in terms of symmetry of the losses from 
both too-high and too-low inflation.
12 The Governor of the Riksbank is Stefan Ingves.
13 See Fischer (1994, 1995).  Much of my discussion was with particular reference to the United Kingdom, 
and I argued that the Bank of England should receive independence.

those who make critically important policy decisions.”14 Accountability, in the senses I 

defined it, included the requirement “to explain and justify its policies to the legislature 

and the public”--that is, policy transparency and communications.15 Transparency, 

public accountability, and policy communications form the quid pro quo of central bank 

independence, and they can also contribute to achievement of macroeconomic goals.

These were points the FOMC recognized in its Statement on Longer-Run Goals and 

Monetary Policy Strategy, which observed that clarity concerning policy decisions 

“increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and 

accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.” In my coverage of these 

issues today, however, I would like to concentrate on the Bank of England, which in the 

past quarter-century has been an innovator in several ways with regard to accountability 

and transparency.

Calls for more transparency concerning U.K. monetary policy and the Bank of 

England’s monetary actions predated independence.  For example, in the late 1950s, 

Richard Sayers observed:  “It may not be wise to turn the central bank into a goldfish 

bowl, but at least some relaxation of the traditional secretiveness would make for better 

health in the nation’s monetary affairs.”16 And some Bank communications vehicles, 

such as the economic analysis in the Quarterly Bulletin and testimony and speeches by 

the Governor and other Bank officials, were of long standing by the mid-1990s.  But the 

Bank of England made further strides toward improved transparency and 

communications during the 1990s.  In 1993, it initiated the Inflation Report. From the

16 See Sayers (1958, p. 314).

beginning, the Inflation Report was intended to increase transparency about the U.K. 

monetary policy reaction function--that is, the connection between policy instruments and 

economic variables, including the goal variables.17 After independence, the Inflation 

Report presented the MPC’s inflation forecast.  Furthermore, alongside other Bank 

statements, the Inflation Report provides a publicly available analysis of the economy 

and of economic implications of developments like Brexit.  The content reflects the

Bank’s change in focus--from markets in the pre-inflation-targeting era to 

macroeconomic implications of financial and other developments.18

The Bank expanded its policy communications after 1997, publishing MPC 

analogues to the FOMC releases (some of them only recent innovations by the Fed),

namely, postmeeting MPC statements and meeting minutes.  And an innovation of 

Mervyn King in the early years of inflation targeting that has continued in the era of 

independence is the Inflation Report press conference.  Here, senior Bank figures discuss 

the MPC’s forecast and the state of the economy.  This innovation was a forerunner of 

the Federal Reserve Chair’s press conference, begun in 2011, in which the Chair 

describes the latest policy decision together with the Summary of Economic Projections 

(SEP) of FOMC participants.

17 See Crockett (1994, p. 183). The desire to be explicit about the reaction function has continued to be a 
theme of policymaker statements in the era of the MPC.  See, for example, King (2002), Allsopp (2002), 
Tucker (2007), and Bean (2009).
18 The MPC arrangements also require that a letter be written from the Bank Governor to the Chancellor of 
the Exchequer in the event of an overshoot or undershoot of the inflation target that is in excess of 1 
percent.  As well as providing accountability, this arrangement gives the Bank an opportunity to emphasize 
the longer-term nature of the inflation goal and the consideration given in MPC policy decisions to the 
stabilization of real economic activity.  For example, Carney (2016) outlined, among other things, “the 
horizon over which the MPC judges it appropriate to return inflation to the target” and “the trade-off that 
has been made with regard to inflation and output variability in determining the scale and duration of any 
expected deviation of inflation from the target.”

New Monetary Policy Tools

The MPC and FOMC have extensively--particularly in recent years--used two 

monetary policy tools other than decisions on the current short-term interest rate.  These 

tools are forward guidance and asset purchases.19

Monetary authorities used to be reluctant to discuss the future course of the policy 

rate.20 By 1997, however, there was widespread recognition of the merits of clarity on 

the reaction function and of having long-term interest rates incorporate accurate 

expectations of future policy.  These considerations led to the FOMC’s use of forward 

guidance regarding the short-term interest rate in its postmeeting statements during the 

mid-2000s.  The MPC, in contrast, for a long time generally preferred to let markets infer 

likely future rates from the extensive communication it provided about its reaction 

function.21

Beginning in 2008, with the policy rate at or near its lower bound, regular forward 

guidance acquired new efficacy.22 Through forward guidance, additional 

19 In addition to these tools, the MPC has used the Funding for Lending Scheme to boost bank lending.  It is 
beyond the scope of my talk to discuss this further innovation.
20 For example, Federal Reserve Chairman Arthur Burns once noted (Burns, 1977, p. 717): “Federal 
Reserve officials are extremely careful to avoid any public comment that might suggest or imply some 
particular outlook for interest rates.”  In the United Kingdom, in 1981 Chancellor of the Exchequer 
Geoffrey Howe observed (Howe, 1981) that it was not the authorities’ “practice to forecast interest rate 
movements.”
21 Although it provides an inflation forecast in the Inflation Report, the MPC does not form an interest rate 
forecast in conjunction with that inflation forecast.  Instead, its current practice is to report a “CPI inflation 
projection based on market interest rate expectations” (Bank of England, 2017b, chart 5.1). The fact that 
the MPC’s Inflation Report forecasts (for real output growth, inflation, and the unemployment rate)
condition on market expectations of interest rates is one difference between the MPC forecasts and the 
FOMC participants’ projections that are summarized in the SEP.  Another difference is that the SEP 
consolidates information on the projections constructed and submitted separately by the individual FOMC 
participants, while the Inflation Report’s economic projections are arrived at collectively by the MPC and 
are therefore the forecasts of the committee as a whole. This is another aspect of the differences of 
behavior between the two monetary committees that is both interesting and possibly important, but for 
which there is not enough time for a more detailed discussion.
22 Woodford (2013) provides an analysis of the value of forward guidance under various conditions, 
including the case in which the policy rate is at its lower bound.

accommodation from short-term interest rate policy could be provided by lengthening the 

period over which the policy rate was expected to remain at its lower bound.  The 

knowledge that the short-term policy rate likely would be lower for longer would put 

downward pressure on longer-term rates.  The FOMC has provided forward guidance on 

the policy rate in its postmeeting statements ever since the target federal funds rate was 

brought to the lower bound in December 2008.  In addition, the SEP shows individual 

FOMC participants’ expectations regarding the policy rate, though it does not identify the 

individuals in the interest rate dot plot.  In the United Kingdom, the MPC started 

providing forward guidance in its postmeeting statements in 2013.23

As the policy rate--Bank Rate--is still at its lower bound in the United Kingdom, 

it remains to be seen whether MPC forward guidance will continue during policy firming.  

For its part, the FOMC has provided forward guidance in its policy statements during the 

tightening phase that began with the increase in the target range for the federal funds rate 

in December 2015. I expect that the Bank of England will also likely continue to use 

forward guidance when it begins to raise the policy interest rate above its effective lower 

bound.

Asset purchases are less of a new tool than forward guidance.  In the early post-

World War II decades, both U.K. and U.S. authorities sporadically attempted to influence 

long-term interest rates directly by transacting in longer-term Treasury securities.  By 

1997, however, monetary policy operations in longer-term securities markets had fallen 

into disuse.24 The financial crisis changed matters, with both countries’ central banks 

23 See Carney (2014) for a discussion of the benefits of forward guidance for the U.K. economy.
24 Federal Reserve operations for monetary policy purposes in longer-term securities markets had largely 
been absent since the Operation Twist experiment of the early 1960s (see, for example, Meltzer (2009, pp. 
316-23)).  In the United Kingdom, operations in longer-term securities markets had continued to figure 


- 10 -

expanding their balance sheets through large-scale purchases of longer-dated securities to 

put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and set in motion movements in 

asset prices and borrowing costs that would stimulate spending by households and 

businesses.  It is widely, though not universally, recognized that these asset purchases 

helped contain the economic downturns in the United Kingdom and the United States and 

underpinned the subsequent recovery in each country.  This experience raises the 

question of whether the balance sheet will continue to be a routine tool of monetary 

policy once interest rates normalize.25 The FOMC has indicated its preference that, 

barring large adverse shocks to the economy, adjustments to the federal funds rate will be 

the main means of altering the stance of monetary policy.26

Changing Perspectives on the Lender of Last Resort

The second section concerns the role of the lender of last resort.  The financial 

crisis and recession confirmed the value of central bank tools that affect the financial 

system, beyond those most associated with monetary policy.  One of these tools is the 

discount window or lender-of-last-resort function.  As of the mid-2000s, the posture of 

the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve toward the lender-of-last-resort function

reflected the principles enunciated by Bagehot and the long absence of a severe financial 

crisis:  The discount rate stood above the key policy rate by a fixed amount; the discount 

importantly in monetary policy until the mid-1980s, reflecting attempts by the authorities to influence the 
term structure of interest rates or to control the stock of money or the volume of liquidity (see Fischer 
(1987), Goodhart (1999), and Batini and Nelson (2005)).  A difference between most of these earlier 
operations and those in the modern era is that recent years’ asset purchases have usually involved an 
expansion of the central bank’s overall balance sheet.
25 For a recent discussion of the Federal Reserve’s position on the matter, see Yellen (2017).
26 See, for example, Board of Governors (2017).

window was not used for macroeconomic stabilization; and depository institutions were 

the users of the discount window, typically on a short-term basis.27

In 1978, Rudi Dornbusch and I noted that the lender-of-last-resort function should 

imply that “the central bank steps in to ensure that funds are available to make loans to 

firms which are perfectly sound but, because of panic, are having trouble raising 

funds.”28 In the financial crisis that started in 2007, wide-ranging measures were taken 

along these lines.  In order to improve the functioning of U.S. credit markets, the Federal 

Reserve made numerous changes to its lending arrangements:  The spread of the discount 

rate over the policy rate was lowered, lending was extended to include loans to 

nondepository financial institutions, and facilities were created allowing longer maturity

of, and broader collateral for, loans than was usual for the central bank.29

After its own experience during the financial crisis, the Bank of England 

permanently widened lender-of-last-resort access to include not only commercial banks, 

but also other systemically important financial institutions.30 In the United States, the 

discount rate has for several years been back to its normal relationship with the policy 

rate, and the special lending facilities have long since been wound up.  Emergency 

lending facilities of the type seen during the financial crisis remain feasible, if needed, 

though their usage has not been incorporated into the Federal Reserve’s routine lender-of-

last-resort powers, along the lines of the changes seen in the United Kingdom.  Instead, 

27 See Bagehot ([1873] 1897) for the classic discussion of the central bank’s role as lender of last resort.
28 See Dornbusch and Fischer (1978, p. 528).
29 This is a very brief and simplified discussion of the actions taken by the Federal Reserve with regard to 
the discount window during the crisis.  See, among others, Cecchetti (2009) and Madigan (2009) for 
detailed discussions.  For reasons of space, I will not recount the United Kingdom’s policy response in this 
area during the crisis.
30 Specifically, the Bank provided access to the largest broker-dealers subject to U.K. regulation and to 
central counterparties. See Carney (2014) and Bank of England (2015b).

the restriction on their deployment has been tightened by requiring approval by the U.S. 

Treasury.

Discount window lending puts public funds at risk--though I stress that the 

Federal Reserve’s lending during the crisis did not, in fact, lead to any losses.  The lender 

of last resort is also a less impersonal, and more allocative, device than aggregate 

monetary policy tools, because it involves direct lending by the central bank instead of an 

attempt by monetary policy to alter the overall cost of private-sector borrowing.  For 

these reasons, the lender-of-last-resort function is bound to be more rule driven than 

interest rate policy, and it is inevitably associated with collateral arrangements and other 

safeguards to protect against losses and with strict eligibility criteria.

The Financial Stability Responsibility of the Central Bank

Our third and final section concerns the financial stability responsibility of the 

central bank. This responsibility has been subject to considerable institutional change 

over the past two decades.  Until 1997, the Bank of England had wide supervisory and 

regulatory powers.  With the reforms of the late 1990s, the Bank had a deputy governor 

responsible for financial stability, but regulatory powers were largely moved to a 

different institution, the Financial Services Authority (FSA).  A decade later, the financial 

crisis demonstrated that financial imbalances can ultimately endanger macroeconomic 

stability and highlighted the need for enhanced central bank oversight of the financial 

system.  In the post-crisis era, the FSA became two separate regulatory authorities, one of 

which--the Prudential Regulation Authority, created in 2012--is part of the Bank of 

England. In effect, regulatory powers have largely returned to the Bank.  It is fair to say 


- 13 -

that the Bank was initially glad to cede many of its financial powers, but that it was later 

even more glad to have those powers restored.

Financial supervision has also been reformed in the United States in light of the 

crisis.  The Federal Reserve, which always had regulatory powers, received enhanced 

authority and devoted more resources to financial stability.31 In both countries, it 

remains the case that not all financial stability responsibilities rest with the central bank--

so it is less independent in this area than in monetary policy proper--and the central 

bank’s tools for achieving financial stability are still being refined. Indeed, as I have

noted previously, a major concern of mine is that the U.S. macroprudential toolkit is not 

large and not yet battle tested.32

The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England benefit from each other’s 

experience as they develop and improve arrangements to meet their financial stability 

responsibilities.  One major innovation that deserves mention is that the Bank of England

has two policy committees: Alongside the MPC is the Financial Policy Committee 

(FPC).  Although they coordinate and have partially overlapping memberships, the MPC 

and FPC are distinct committees.

Why have both the MPC and the FPC? I offer a few possible reasons.  First, not 

all of a central bank’s responsibilities typically rest with its monetary committee.  This is 

true not only of the Bank of England, but also of the Federal Reserve:  Our financial 

regulatory authority resides in the Board of Governors, not the FOMC.  Second, 

aggregate monetary policy tools--typically, one is talking of the policy interest rate--are

31 This resource decision led, in 2010, to the creation within the Federal Reserve Board of the Office of 
Financial Stability Policy and Research (which later became the Division of Financial Stability).
32 See Fischer (2015b).

often blunt weapons against financial imbalances, so deploying them might produce a 

conflict between financial stability and short-term economic stabilization.

Macroprudential tools may be more direct and more appropriate for fostering financial 

stability.33 Third, financial policy might need less frequent adjustment than monetary 

policy.  Perhaps reflecting this judgment, the FPC meets on a quarterly basis, which 

contrasts with the MPC’s eight meetings a year.34 The lower frequency of meetings may 

also reflect the desirability of a relatively stable regulatory structure; financial tools likely 

should not be as continuously data dependent as monetary policy tools.

It is clear that the U.K. institutional framework for the preservation of financial 

stability has much to be said for it.  But it also seems clear that there is no uniquely 

optimal set-up of the framework for the maintenance of financial stability that is 

independent of the size and scale of the financial system of the country or of its political 

and financial history.

Conclusion

It has been more than 20 years since the Bank of England celebrated its 300th 

birthday with a conference focused on central bank independence.  Since then, central 

banks’ operating frameworks have undergone substantial changes, many in response to 

the financial crisis. But the case for monetary policy independence set out in the 1990s 

remains sound, and monetary policy independence is now widely accepted in the United 

Kingdom, as it long has been in the United States.  It is also clear that central bank 

responsibilities other than policy rate decisions--specifically, the lender-of-last-resort 

33 For policymakers’ consideration of this point in the U.S. context, see, for example, Bernanke (2011) and 
Board of Governors (2016).

function and financial stability--are closely connected with monetary policy and that 

these responsibilities play a prominent role in macroeconomic stabilization.

Let me conclude by observing that, while the crisis and its aftermath motivated 

central banks to reappraise and adapt their tools, institutions, and thinking, future 

challenges will doubtless prompt further reforms.35 Or, if I may be permitted a few final 

words on my way out the door, the watchwords of the central banker should be “Semper

vigilans,” because history and financial markets are masters of the art of surprise, and 

“Never say never,” because you will sometimes find yourself having to do things that you 

never thought you would.

35 It is worth noting that the 20-year period that is the focus of these remarks constitutes only a little over 
6 percent of the history of the Bank of England--and there certainly have been a lot of surprises during that 
short period in the history of the second oldest of the world’s central banks.
