December 2, 2010 





Good afternoon.  I am delighted to be here for the 10th anniversary of the 

establishment of the Payment Cards Center at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  

I would especially like to recognize Bob Hunt, director of the center, and his staff as well 

as the leadership of the Philadelphia Fed for providing such an outstanding forum for 

research, policy, and industry discussion in the important area of consumer credit and 

payments. 

I plan to set the stage for this conference by focusing on three topics that are of 

particular interest to the Federal Reserve:  changes in consumer credit, changes in the use 

of payment methods, and regulatory developments that affect both consumer credit and 

payments.  I’ll finish with some comments about the future of consumer payments. 

Changes in Consumer Credit 

During the recent financial crisis, the Federal Reserve and other policymakers 

throughout the government took unprecedented actions to mitigate the fallout from 

severely distressed market conditions and support the flow of credit to consumers and 

businesses.  Nonetheless, the level of credit outstanding for households has been very 

slow to rebound and remains lower than it was at the onset of the crisis.  The reasons for 

the slow rebound are, without a doubt, complex and multidimensional.  Still, it is 

worthwhile to examine the data and try to understand why credit growth is not more 

robust.   

For this forum, I have chosen to focus my discussion on factors affecting the 

overall movements in credit card debt.  The bulk of revolving credit in the United States 

today is held in the form of credit card debt.  As the financial crisis developed in late 

2008, the aggregate amount of credit card debt outstanding began to fall.  Revolving

credit has dropped every month since that time and is currently about 15 percent lower 

than it was at the time of the Lehman Brothers Holdings bankruptcy.  Although our 

economy has experienced other long episodes in which revolving credit growth has 

slowed, we have never seen such a prolonged period of outright decline.   

As overall consumer spending weakened significantly over the course of the 

recession and the early stages of the recovery, a proportionate decline in revolving credit 

used to finance purchases might actually have been expected.  However, the decrease in 

revolving credit appeared to outpace the contemporaneous decline in spending during the 

recession, and, so far in the recovery, revolving credit has continued to decrease even as 

spending has turned up.  This suggests that there are factors at work other than cyclical 

spending weakness.  Within this context, it is helpful to consider the three main reasons 

that net borrowing--that is, the change in credit outstanding--can decrease:  First, 

households can charge less on their revolving accounts; second, households can pay off a 

larger share of their balances each month; or third, households can default on (or lenders 

can charge off) their existing balances.   

Taking the three factors in reverse order, consider first the role of cardholder 

defaults.  As the economy weakened in 2008 and 2009, an increasing number of 

households found it difficult to pay their credit card bills on time.  With nearly 10 percent 

of the workforce unemployed and many more underemployed, a significant number of 

households experienced sharply reduced incomes.  Weakness in the housing market also 

contributed to financial strains, as many households could no longer easily tap into home 


 - 3 -

equity to consolidate their card debt and lower their monthly payments.1  In this adverse 

economic environment, it is perhaps not surprising that the charge-off rate on credit cards 

more than doubled from about 4 percent in 2007 to more than 9 percent in 2009.  The rate 

of charge-offs has since declined from its peak but remains elevated.  All told, we 

estimate that the rise in charge-offs can account for about one-third of the net decline in 

revolving credit growth from 2007 to 2009.   

Another possible explanation for the decline in outstanding balances might be that 

households, in an effort to repair their balance sheets or bring down their debt burdens, 

have begun paying down their credit card balances faster than usual.  But, on the whole, 

the data do not indicate that faster paydown is a significant factor.  Historically, 

households tend to repay their credit card balances at a faster rate during good economic 

times and tend to slow this rate when economic activity is weak.  And, over the past 

several years, this tendency appears to have held up.  In 2006, the rate of credit card 

repayment was well above its long-run trend, probably reflecting strong incomes as well 

as ample home equity that could be tapped to pay off more expensive card debt.  

However, beginning in 2007, as housing markets weakened and unemployment climbed, 

households began to pay off their card debt at a significantly slower pace--a trend that 

extended into 2008 and 2009 as the economic downturn worsened.  All told, the drop in 

the payoff rate has been more pronounced than in the recessions of 1990-91 and 2000-01.  

More recently, however, this trend has reversed, and as of August 2010, the repayment 

rate had risen to a more typical level.  While this increase likely reflects a gradual 

improvement in the ability of cardholders to repay their debt, it could also be attributed to 

                                                 
1 On average since 2003, about half of the respondents to the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan 
Surveys of Consumers who took cash out during a mortgage refinancing have reported using the funds to 
pay down other debt.

a shift in the composition of cardholders in bank portfolios toward more creditworthy 

borrowers as charged-off accounts were replaced with new accounts underwritten using 

stricter criteria.  The bottom line is that accelerated payment rates on existing balances do 

not seem to have contributed importantly to the drop in credit card debt outstanding over 

the past couple of years. 

Finally, consumers have been charging less on their credit cards.  According to 

industry statistics, the amount of money charged on credit cards for purchases or cash 

advances fell around 10 percent between the third quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 

2010.  This slowdown in new charges could be the result of a variety of factors.  The 

significant overall drop in consumption during the recession no doubt cut into the 

demand for credit, as households simply opted to spend less than in the past.  When they 

did spend, they may have been less willing to borrow to fund consumption given their 

experiences during the financial crisis, expectations for weaker economic conditions, and 

continued uncertainty about job prospects.  Indeed, consumer preferences toward debt do 

appear to have shifted.  Preliminary data from the 2007-09 Panel Survey of Consumer 

Finances (SCF) show a modest increase--from 35 percent in 2007 to more than 40 

percent in 2009--in the share of households that believed that buying things on credit was 

a “bad idea.”  Further, those households whose views about buying on credit became 

more negative between 2007 and 2009 reported reducing their charges substantially more 

than other households.  Consumers also appear to be seeking less new credit:  

Applications for new credit accounts, as recorded in data from the national credit 

bureaus, remain significantly lower than were observed for most of the past decade.

Credit supply factors have also likely contributed to the decline in overall credit 

card outstanding balances.  Households may have charged less because they had less 

credit available.  In the SCF panel, about 44 percent of households with credit card debt 

in 2007 experienced a reduction in their credit limits by 2009.  Data from the national 

credit bureaus indicate that credit lines peaked in the third quarter of 2008 and continued 

to fall over the course of 2009 and 2010.  The average dollar value of combined credit 

lines available to cardholders fell from a high near $26,000 per cardholder in late 2008 to 

around $21,000 per cardholder by the third quarter of 2010, a decline of about 20 percent.  

Moreover, SCF data indicate that changes in credit limits are indeed related to credit card 

spending:  Among households whose credit limit declined, SCF data show that the 

median amount of monthly new charges fell from $200 in 2007 to $50 in 2009, while 

among households whose credit limit did not decline, the median amount of new charges 

rose from $150 to $200.  Although this relationship is not necessarily causal, credit line 

restrictions have likely played at least some role in the reduction in credit card borrowing. 

Looking further at the supply side of credit card debt, card lenders did report 

retrenching during the financial crisis.  According to the Federal Reserve Board’s 

quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS), 

large fractions of banks tightened standards and terms on new and existing credit card 

accounts throughout 2008 and 2009.2  In recent months, however, some banks reported 

having eased standards somewhat.  In the most recent survey, published in October 2010, 

about two-thirds of banks thought that credit standards for prime borrowers on credit card 

loans and other consumer loans either were at their longer-run averages or would return 

                                                 
2 Results of the SLOOS are available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/SnLoanSurvey.

to them over the next two years.  In contrast, for nonprime borrowers, more than half of 

the respondents thought that standards would remain tighter through at least 2013 or 

would not return to longer-run norms for the foreseeable future.    

In addition to reductions in existing credit lines, new credit card account 

solicitations also fell considerably during the recession.  By early 2009, offers to 

households for new credit cards had dropped to around one-fifth of their count in 2006.  

Card solicitations have turned up over the course of 2010, but they remain well below 

their pre-crisis levels.  In addition, consistent with the SLOOS, the data on credit card 

offers show that solicitations to borrowers with lower credit scores are rebounding more 

slowly than those to borrowers with higher scores.  

Interest rates may have caused some households to reduce their credit card usage 

even if unused credit lines remained available.  Although credit card interest rates 

declined in line with broader interest rates early in the financial crisis, card rates diverged 

from the broader rate environment by reversing this decline during 2009.  Some of the 

rate increase likely reflects a rise in charge-offs, which increases card issuers’ costs of 

providing credit.  However, the divergence from rates on other forms of credit that also 

experienced higher charge-offs indicates that a portion of the increase may have been in 

anticipation of regulatory changes, which I will discuss a bit later, that will restrict some 

card issuers’ ability to reprice credit. 

Overall, then, the available data lead me to conclude that, in large part, the decline 

in revolving consumer credit outstanding is due to a combination of higher charge-offs, 

tighter credit, and less consumer willingness to take on debt, but probably not to 

widespread increases in discretionary paydowns of existing debt.

Although households account for the vast majority of credit card loans and credit 

card spending in our economy, the market for small business credit cards has grown 

considerably over the past 10 to 15 years.  After checking accounts, credit cards are the 

second-most-common financial product used by small businesses.  Small business cards 

are structured to cater to business needs with features, pricing, and underwriting unique 

to their typical usage.  Issuers provide several services specifically for small businesses, 

such as employee cards with customizable spending limits and detailed spending 

statements each month or quarter.  Also, small business cards often have higher credit 

limits than personal cards to facilitate the higher spending needs of small businesses. 

Small businesses are noticeably less likely than households to carry a balance on 

their cards.  As of the end of 2009, 83 percent of small businesses used credit cards.  Of 

those using credit cards, 64 percent used small business cards and 41 percent used 

personal cards.  Despite the widespread use of credit cards, only a minority of small 

businesses--18 percent--reported borrowing on credit cards.  In comparison, nearly one-

half of households reported carrying a balance on their credit cards.3  Thus, although 

most small businesses appear to use credit cards for transactions purposes, and perhaps as 

a source of short-term credit, the data suggest that only a small fraction of them rely on 

credit cards as a source of longer-term credit.  Yet even if firms do not carry a balance, 

reductions in the size of their credit card lines may strain their cash flow and force them 

to cut spending or require them to use more expensive forms of short-term credit, such as 

trade finance.

Changes in the Use of Payment Instruments 

Consumer credit pricing and availability also appear to affect consumer 

preferences for different payment methods.  When consumers decide how to pay for their 

purchases, they may have a variety of payment options to choose from, including cash, 

checks, debit cards, credit cards, prepaid cards, and even, increasingly, their mobile 

phones.  The Federal Reserve has tracked changes in consumers’ use of payment 

instruments in a number of studies over the past decade.  These studies cast an interesting 

light on the effects that weakened economic conditions have had on the mix of payments. 

The number of checks processed in the United States has been declining since the 

late 1990s, as consumers, businesses, and governments have shifted away from checks 

and toward electronic payment methods.  The annual number of checks dropped from 

more than 40 billion in 2000 to 30 billion in 2006, and we expect the data for 2009 to 

show continued declines. 

At the same time, the use of debit and credit cards has risen.  Debit card 

payments, in particular, have grown remarkably:  Between 2000 and 2008, the number of 

debit card transactions grew at an annual rate of more than 17 percent, while the value of 

debit card transactions grew 15 percent per year.  Credit card transactions have grown at 

a slower pace than debit card transactions over the same period--about 2 percent per year 

in number and roughly 5 percent per year in value.  For smaller-value payments, both 

types of cards, but especially debit cards, have served as substitutes for checks and, very 

likely, cash.  Although the nature of cash makes direct measurement of aggregate cash 

payments difficult, we can infer a trend in usage from changes in the level of small-

denomination currency that is most frequently used in cash payments.  The amount of 


 - 9 -

small-denomination domestic currency in circulation has been steadily declining since the 

1970s, leading us to believe that cash payments have similarly declined. 

Most interestingly, the recent period of economic weakness appears to have 

caused some consumers to shift away from credit cards not only as a source of credit but 

also as a method of payment.  As I said earlier, between late 2008 and early 2010, the 

value of credit card purchases declined 10 percent.  In comparison, although the rate of 

growth in debit card use slowed during the recession, debit card transactions did not 

decline in either volume or value.   

This shift from credit to debit makes sense from the perspective of the consumer.  

If credit is tight and consumption is contracting, consumers who are reluctant or unable to 

increase their debt levels can use debit cards to pay for current expenses out of current, 

rather than future, income.  In addition, for individuals with existing credit card balances, 

interest must be paid on new purchases as well as on previous balances.  Those 

individuals might seek to avoid interest charges on new purchases by using debit cards.  

This incentive is even stronger in the presence of higher credit card interest rates.  

Finally, some consumers might use debit cards to track their spending in real time when 

budgets are tight. 

Regulatory Changes in Consumer Credit and Payments 

In addition to the economic recession and recovery, the regulations governing 

consumer payment and credit products changed significantly in the past few years.  So it 

is especially difficult to separate the effects of economic conditions from regulatory 

effects on credit and debit card usage.  


 - 10 -

In December 2008, the Federal Reserve issued rules that introduced new 

consumer protections and revised the disclosures that consumers receive in connection 

with their credit card accounts.  Then, in May 2009, the Congress enacted the Credit Card 

Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (Credit CARD) Act, which contained 

additional provisions regarding credit cards and gift cards.  Collectively, these rules have 

comprehensively overhauled the regulatory regime that applies to credit cards.   

In large part, these reforms developed in response to concerns about the growing 

complexity of the products offered to consumers and concerns that consumers could not 

accurately assess the costs associated with their credit cards.  To address these concerns, 

the Federal Reserve used extensive consumer testing to develop new disclosures to be 

provided with credit card solicitations and in periodic statements.  These disclosures 

highlight key account terms and attempt to improve consumers’ understanding of the 

costs associated with using their cards.  The resulting disclosure requirements establish a 

new baseline for transparency in the credit card industry.  In addition, the new rules ban 

certain practices that increase the cost of credit in ways that cannot easily be disclosed to 

consumers, such as double-cycle billing.  The new rules also generally prohibit card 

issuers from increasing interest rates applied to existing balances and require issuers to 

provide adequate notice of higher rates to be applied to future balances.   

It is too early to draw conclusions about the ultimate impact of these changes 

because many of the new requirements have been in effect only since earlier this year.  

For example, card issuers appear to have changed their credit card pricing and 

underwriting models as their ability to use penalty pricing has been reduced.  And some 

of the reduction in new account solicitations may also be due in part to the regulatory 


 - 11 -

changes.  But, in light of the concurrent changes in charge-off rates, economic conditions, 

and regulatory requirements, it is hard to separate the relative effects of each. 

One way to assess the effects of regulation alone might be to watch the relative 

developments in business credit cards in comparison to consumer credit cards.  Credit 

cards issued primarily for business or commercial purposes generally are not governed by 

the consumer protections in the Truth in Lending Act or the amendments to that act in the 

2009 Credit CARD Act.  Some observers have already expressed concern that some card 

issuers may be marketing business and professional cards to consumers in an effort to 

sidestep new restrictions.  At the same time, some business owners and professionals 

might find the higher credit line availability or other terms offered on business cards to be 

more attractive than using their personal cards for business expenses.  The federal 

banking agencies have sufficient supervisory and enforcement authority to ensure that 

issuers market and issue business cards only to borrowers who they have legitimate 

reason to believe are using them for business purposes.  Generally speaking, the card 

issuer is responsible for determining whether an account is intended to be used for 

business or personal purposes, and indeed, business card applications commonly request 

information necessary to make this determination.  The detailed information requested 

may include, for example, the type of business, annual revenue, age of the firm, number 

of employees, and tax identification number.  The answers to these questions help verify 

that the applicant owns a business, as well as gauge the creditworthiness of the business.   

Aside from credit cards, the regulatory landscape is also changing for other 

payment products.  The Federal Reserve has recently issued regulations that prohibit 

consumers from being automatically enrolled in overdraft programs for overdrafts created 


 - 12 -

by automated teller machine withdrawals and one-time debit card transactions.  In 

addition, new disclosures are required to help consumers understand the associated costs 

before they choose to opt into overdraft coverage.  We have also implemented new 

protections under the Credit CARD Act that restrict the fees and expiration dates that 

apply to gift cards.4   

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the 

Federal Reserve to develop standards for debit card interchange fees and the routing of 

debit card transactions.  I am aware of the high level of interest in this topic, and I 

recognize the importance of the statute and its implementation for the future development 

of the payment card industry.  However, we plan to issue a proposal for comment soon, 

so I will not comment on any specific elements at this time. 

Just as credit card products have undergone change in response to the new credit 

card rules, new regulations affecting debit card overdrafts and interchange fees are likely 

to result in some changes in deposit product pricing and design.  For example, depository 

institutions have stated that they are reconsidering their ability to offer free or low-cost 

checking accounts if losses due to lower revenue from overdraft or interchange fees 

materialize.  As the pricing of checking accounts changes, financial institutions and 

consumers may turn to certain types of reloadable prepaid cards as checking account 

alternatives. 

The Future of Consumer Credit and Payments 

While the pace of the economic recovery and the effects of new consumer 

regulations are strongly influencing lender and consumer behavior, the evolution in the 

                                                 
4 For more information on the new rules concerning credit cards and other payment products, see the “What 
You Need to Know” publication series, available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/consumerinfo/wyntk.htm. 


 - 13 -

consumer credit and payments landscape in the years ahead will be equally shaped by 

technological innovation. 

Innovative product and system design in the payment card marketplace continues 

to produce new electronic payment products.  For example, a growing number of 

consumers are using prepaid cards.  Preliminary estimates from the Federal Reserve Bank 

of Boston’s 2009 Survey of Consumer Payment Choice indicate that about one-third of 

consumers sampled reported having a prepaid card of some type. 

Offering functionality similar to credit and debit cards, prepaid cards include a 

variety of products targeted to different groups of customers, from general-purpose 

reloadable cards that may serve as deposit account substitutes for the unbanked or the 

underbanked to more-limited-purpose products, such as gift cards, teen spending cards, or 

mass transit cards.  In addition, as an alternative to checks, employers issue payroll cards 

to employees and numerous government entities make payments and issue benefits on 

cards.  And of course, the idea behind prepaid cards is not limited to being in card form; 

their function also may show up in the form of codes, stickers, cell phones, and chips 

embedded in any number of other devices, with payments transferring across the debit 

card interchange system or automated clearinghouse systems.  Depending on the card 

type, the issuer, the purpose of issuance, the payment collection network, and the form of 

access, payments made using prepaid cards or other devices may be governed by 

different regulations and interchange fee restrictions.  Consumers cannot be expected to 

know these differences.  It will be important for regulators to monitor, over time, the 

effect of differences in regulation and pricing restrictions to ensure that consumers are 

adequately protected regardless of their payment method preferences.   


 - 14 -

Other emerging payment methods, such as mobile payments, also show potential 

for broad adoption in the United States.  Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve Board 

hosted a forum on consumer protection and education issues associated with mobile 

payment methods.  The Reserve Banks, including the Reserve Bank of Philadelphia 

through the efforts of the Payment Cards Center, have also been active in soliciting 

information from industry participants on the roles that various players are taking on in 

U.S. mobile payments and the forces that are affecting the rate of adoption by card 

issuers, merchants, networks, telecommunication firms, consumers, and others.  As of 

yet, mobile payments do not represent a meaningful percentage of overall consumer 

payments in the United States, but the Federal Reserve remains engaged in monitoring 

the emergence of this product to ensure that adequate consumer protections are put in 

place as the technology is adopted more broadly in the marketplace. 

Conclusion 

In closing, I encourage you to continue to push forward on research and policy 

work in the area of consumer credit and payments.  The landscape is changing rapidly 

and dramatically in response to economic, regulatory, and technological developments.  

You have some very interesting conversations ahead of you during this conference and 

quite challenging work for the foreseeable future as these markets continue to evolve.  I 

wish you great success in your work, and I thank you for inviting me to participate in this 

conference.
