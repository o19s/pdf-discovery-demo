2011 Exploring Innovation:  A Conference on Community Development Finance

May 10, 2011 





Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be in St. Louis to open the third biennial 

Exploring Innovation Conference.  The first Exploring Innovation conference was 

opened four years ago by Professor Andrew Hargadon, the Charles J. Soderquist Chair in 

Entrepreneurship at the University of California, Davis and a senior fellow at the 

Kauffman Foundation.  His remarks established a framework of collaboration for 

innovation in community development finance.  Since then, this conference has served as 

a forum for sharing ideas and maintaining the networks that are so critical to this work. 

Professor Hargadon initially set the stage by explaining that innovation and 

creativity are not the same.  An individual acting alone to solve a problem can be 

creative, while innovation is the process of adding value by applying a new idea or 

method to something that is already established.  For example, Henry Ford did not 

contribute the creative energy to invent an automobile.  Rather, Ford’s innovation was the 

idea to combine the 100-year-old technology for the automobile with the meat packing 

industry’s assembly line process, resulting in a means to mass produce cars.  On the same 

note, Apple did not invent the MP3 player with the introduction of the iPod.  Rather, the 

company used existing technology and a collaboration with the music industry to develop 

iTunes software, bringing an affordable application of the MP3 to the public.  In each of 

these examples, improving upon a good idea was as important, if not more important, 

than the initial idea.  The message for community development professionals was the 

importance of collaboration, sharing ideas, and building upon the ideas of others in order 

to innovate for the benefit of our communities. 

The significance of Professor Hargadon’s message should not be lost in today’s 

challenging economic climate.  Times are particularly difficult for residents of our low- 


 - 2 -

and moderate-income communities who are struggling more than ever to support their 

families, obtain affordable housing, and access basic services.  We are here this week to 

develop fresh approaches to address these persistent problems that are even more 

widespread today than they were four years ago.  Throughout the conference, I hope you 

will contribute your own best ideas and look for ways to use the ideas of others to 

improve your own communities and enhance your innovation network. 

To this end, I would like to talk about efforts underway across the Federal 

Reserve System and to share some of our ideas and resources.  Situated at the intersection 

of the federal government and private financial institutions, the Federal Reserve System 

is well-positioned to facilitate collaborative activities among experts in the community 

development finance industry.  Through our network of 12 Reserve Banks across the 

country, we build relationships with local governments, nonprofits, foundations, 

academic institutions, and financing entities.  We use outreach to connect the creative 

minds working in community development to generate innovative policy and finance 

solutions.  By adding applied research to the mix, we convene these stakeholders around 

particular community development topics and disseminate information to low- and 

moderate-income communities, practitioners, and other interested parties. 

I realize that collaboration and innovation can sound abstract, so let me offer 

some examples of issues that the Fed has championed recently, and where we have seen 

the results of our efforts.   

Housing Crisis 

I would like to start with the Federal Reserve System’s response to the housing 

crisis as it unfolded over the past three years.  Our multifaceted response included 


 - 3 -

guidance to banks, updates to regulations, changes to monetary policy, and analytical 

research contributions.  It also included engagement in national and regional partnerships 

to inform policy and practices around foreclosure prevention and neighborhood 

stabilization in communities hard hit by foreclosures.   

From the onset of the crisis, we called on the expertise of community 

development professionals within the Federal Reserve System to respond to concerns 

from homeowners by crafting strategies to enhance foreclosure mitigation, encourage 

loan modifications, and stave off the rising number of rescue scams.  The Fed also 

strengthened existing collaborations with fellow regulators, community groups, policy 

organizations, financial institutions, and public officials to discuss innovative methods for 

preventing unnecessary foreclosures and the negative impact they have on communities.  

One valuable product of this effort was the development and dissemination of data tools, 

heat maps, and detailed analysis to identify neighborhoods most at risk of foreclosures 

and their damaging effects.  Equipped with this information, community leaders can 

better target limited resources to borrowers and declining communities.  In 2008, as 

interest in market-specific responses to foreclosures grew, the Fed developed a 

conference series entitled “Recovery, Renewal, Rebuilding”1 in five cities that 

represented a variety of housing markets--from older, industrial cities with shrinking 

populations to boomtowns that grew too quickly. 

Meanwhile, we also launched online Foreclosure Resource Centers at each 

Reserve Bank that continue to provide homeowners, prospective homebuyers, and 

community groups with information to help prevent foreclosures and lessen their 

negative influence on neighborhoods.  These centers offer a variety of resources,

including an enhanced Foreclosure Mitigation Toolkit, which provides detailed steps and 

information for localities seeking to develop foreclosure prevention activities.  The 

toolkit also includes a new Foreclosure Recovery Resource Guide to help consumers 

recover from the foreclosure process. 

As the foreclosure crisis unfolded and concerns expanded from loss mitigation 

and loan modifications to worries about housing values, vacant properties, and 

neighborhood stabilization, the Fed’s response evolved as well.  For example, starting in 

2009, the Board worked with the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and Cleveland to 

produce a publication addressing issues related to the acquisition and disposition of real 

estate owned properties (REO), a term that refers to property owned by a financial 

institution, typically a bank, after a foreclosure.  The publication, “REO and Vacant 

Properties,”2 is a compendium of papers by national experts that highlight their key ideas 

regarding the disposition of vacant properties.  Last November, the papers were presented 

publicly at a forum at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., where more than 

100 participants shared ideas and lessons learned about community stabilization.3  In 

addition, last year, the Federal Reserve worked with other federal regulators to encourage 

neighborhood stabilization activities through the Community Reinvestment Act.  This 

year, we created video reports that describe specific strategies for managing vacant 

properties in Cleveland, Phoenix, and Detroit.4  

Throughout our work on the housing crisis, we have witnessed policy changes

and novel responses to the challenges facing our communities.  The collaborative efforts 

and information sharing from national housing and community development experts, 

including those led by our own staff, helped bring these innovative efforts to fruition.   

For example, as a result of our neighborhood stabilization work, some Reserve Banks 

partnered with national groups to help declining cities learn how to use land banks as a 

potential tool to address high rates of foreclosure and vacant properties.  Based on the 

initial success of the Genesee County Land Bank, established in Michigan in 2002, and 

resources provided by the National Vacant Properties Campaign, land banking is 

becoming an integral part of community revitalization efforts for many places across the 

country.  For example, the city of Cleveland has used the Cuyahoga County Land Bank 

as an important tool to address its vacant property issue.  Cuyahoga County works with 

lenders and servicers, including the government sponsored entities (GSEs), to access 

properties quickly after they become vacant.  This enables the county to make decisions 

regarding the REO before it becomes dilapidated or a nuisance for neighboring 

properties.   

Because dealing with vacant property is a high profile issue in Cleveland, the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly participates in conversations about 

solutions, such as land banking, and provides research on the neighborhood dynamics of 

this problem to support communities crafting solutions.  The Bank recently released the 

“Adaptive Policies Needed to Address Changing Foreclosure Landscape”5 paper to 

highlight the changing circumstances driving the foreclosure crisis and the need for

comprehensive policy approaches that cater to the specific challenges of diverse 

neighborhoods.    

For its part, the city of Cleveland has responded to the growing number of vacant 

properties through the innovative use of data that allows the city to provide 

neighborhood-specific responses.  NEO CANDO, or the Northeast Ohio Community and 

Neighborhood Data for Organizing, is a free and publicly accessible social and economic 

data system provided by the Center on Urban Poverty and Community Development, a 

research institute housed at Case Western Reserve University.  NEO CANDO developers 

recognize that limited resources are available to address foreclosure issues, and their data 

support a systemic methodology for allocating available dollars.  Hopefully, others will 

draw on the experiences with targeted data use in Cleveland just as Cleveland drew on 

the land banking experience of Genesee County. 

Small Business Credit 

Last year, diminishing credit availability for small businesses emerged as a 

significant stumbling block to the economic recovery.  Small businesses are central to 

creating jobs and to restoring our economic prosperity.  In fact, about one-half of all 

Americans are employed by firms with fewer than 500 employees.6  As the challenges 

facing small business owners surfaced, the Federal Reserve sought to better understand 

the nuances of the credit tightening.   

Together, the Reserve Banks across the System leveraged relationships with 

lending institutions, small business owners, and community groups to discuss the changes

in small business credit and think about potential solutions.  Through this initiative, the 

Federal Reserve sought to deepen its understanding of the dynamics of the supply of and 

demand for small business credit, to identify specific credit gaps, and to learn of 

promising practices and suggestions for improvement.  In the course of just five months, 

the Fed hosted more than 40 meetings around the country and finished with a wrap-up 

forum in Washington, D.C., designed to summarize what we had heard and to plan next 

steps.7  Some of the meetings took the form of small focus groups or listening sessions.  

Other meetings were larger in scale, with more formal agendas focusing on a particular 

aspect of small business financing, such as minority entrepreneurship, the role of 

Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), or federal guarantee loan 

programs.  Several meetings focused on a specific industry, such as auto suppliers.  

Whether small or large, all of the meetings brought together small business 

owners, small business trade groups, financial institutions and other private lenders, bank 

supervision officials, CDFIs, and other small business support service providers to 

discuss ways to improve the flow of credit to viable small businesses.  Although the 

information obtained through these meetings was anecdotal in nature, common themes 

did emerge.  And the ability to obtain real-time information directly from lenders and 

potential borrowers has proved invaluable to our understanding of the issues affecting 

credit availability. 

Illustrating the importance of small business access to credit, a compilation of the 

key findings of our outreach effort was included in Chairman Bernanke’s semiannual

Monetary Policy Report to the Congress in July 2010.8  Already, a few of the meeting 

participants’ recommendations have become a policy reality for the small business credit 

market. 

Participants in the nationwide meetings recommended improving access for CDFI 

loan funds to participate as guaranteed lenders in the SBA 7(a) program in order to 

increase the availability of credit to the underserved markets that depend on CDFIs.  

Later, the Small Business Administration (SBA) rolled out two pilot programs aimed at 

increasing the number of loans in these communities.  The Community Advantage 

program will increase the number of lower-dollar loans in underserved communities by 

allowing CDFIs, and other mission-focused lenders, to originate SBA 7(a) loans up to 

$250,000.  Also, the Small Loan Advantage program is structured to encourage larger, 

existing SBA lenders to make lower-dollar loans, which often benefit businesses in 

underserved markets.9  

Meeting participants also expressed support for additional low-cost, long-term 

capital for CDFIs.  Such capital would allow CDFIs to price loans to reflect their risk and 

still offer an affordable rate to small businesses that may not qualify under conventional 

bank standards and products.  One participant recommended that policymakers consider 

capital models for CDFIs that further leverage private dollars and create innovative 

incentives for the private sector to partner with experienced CDFI fund managers with 

strong risk-management capacity.  Soon, as part of the Small Business Jobs Act, the U.S. 

Treasury will provide up to $1 billion annually in federal guarantees for the next three

years for bonds issued by CDFIs for community development purposes.  In addition, the 

act established a $300 million Small Business Lending Facility for Community 

Development Loan Funds.  The regulations for both of these programs are currently 

under development. 

At this point, I am pleased to tell you that recent anecdotal evidence leads me to 

believe that conditions are improving for small businesses.  Although no definitive data 

source exists, the combination of a variety of recent survey results paints a picture of 

increasing optimism about future sales and business conditions and a corresponding 

easing of credit availability for small businesses.10  While this upward trend is 

encouraging, the Fed is continuing to look for ideas that will help small businesses as 

they work through some of the more subtle issues constraining their overall growth.   

Going forward, we will coordinate a series of regional forums for financial 

institutions and CDFIs on the use and deployment of small business programs authorized 

in the Small Business Jobs Act and on sharing information about issues and successful 

practices at a national level.  The forums are being organized with participation from the 

Opportunity Finance Network (OFN), the trade organization for CDFIs; the SBA; the 

Treasury; the CDFI Fund; and our partner regulatory agencies.  In addition to providing 

information to regional forum participants, we will seek to use these forums to gather 

information on best practices, trends, and any barriers to the successful implementation of 

these federal programs.  This year’s work will culminate with a November conference at 

the Board of Governors, in partnership with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, to

discuss small business credit and workforce training issues facing entrepreneurs--

particularly women and minority entrepreneurs and those living in low- and moderate-

income communities.  Because jobs and the needs of low- and moderate-income 

communities remain a priority for us, we will continue to foster collaborative efforts in 

hopes of additional innovative responses.   

Community Data Initiative 

The Federal Reserve has a long history of using anecdotal information gathered 

from businesses within the Reserve Districts to better understand underlying regional 

economies and economic conditions.  One of the lessons to be learned from the role of 

subprime lending in the recent crisis is that it is equally important to pay attention to 

underlying trends in segments of the economy, such as low- to moderate-income 

communities or small businesses.  The anecdotal information we collect from community 

advocates and development professionals is quite valuable, but it will be even more 

actionable if we have a framework for systematically collecting, studying, and 

disseminating the information.  To address this need to identify early warning signs of 

future economic challenges, we are testing several initiatives to collect information from 

practitioners and others working directly in the communities.  This effort, known as the 

“Community Data Initiative,” is intended to provide a systematic approach to gathering 

and disseminating on-the-ground intelligence on current conditions and emerging 

challenges facing low- and moderate-income communities.  Insights from the data will 

inform existing processes at the Fed and provide useful information to low- and 

moderate-income communities.  In order to achieve this new data collection and analysis 

objective, a number of the Reserve Banks are leveraging their own research resources to 


 - 11 -

survey, poll, or otherwise collect information about communities in their District.  At the 

Board, we are also conducting our own surveys to help validate the District results.   

Although the project is in its infant stage, I would like to share some initial 

findings from two of the Reserve Banks that are already participating in the process.  The 

Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s “Community Indicators Project” is a quarterly 

survey tool that includes a collection of open-ended questions to inform community 

development policy and practice in a richer way than quantitative data alone.  Leaders 

from banks, nonprofits, community-based organizations, foundations, local government, 

and the private sector are asked about the conditions and trends affecting low-income 

households.  The lack of jobs was the dominant theme in the first year of data collection, 

with the majority of respondents identifying unemployment as the primary cause of new 

distress in the housing sector as increasing numbers of residents struggled to make 

mortgage or rent payments.  One survey participant stated that “prolonged unemployment 

and underemployment are causing a huge growth in the number of low-and moderate-

income individuals and communities.  Unemployment is now the driving force behind 

most of the other crises we are facing.”11    

Similarly, the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has been using their Emerging 

Issues Surveillance Tool (EIST) to identify the most significant current and emerging 

community development issues in the District’s diverse communities.  The top three 

issues in the spring 2011 data release were employment opportunities, access to housing, 

and home foreclosures.  The jobs issue surfaced again, with a focus on the need for 

training, when a participant stated:  “Employment is the key to sustained self-sufficiency.

There are jobs available in the Washington, D.C., market, but mostly high-skilled jobs for 

which low-income residents are unqualified.”  As with the San Francisco survey, the 

results from this tool provide useful data for Richmond policymakers and District 

stakeholders. 

Virtual Collaboration 

The growth in survey and other tools is intended to expand the Federal Reserve’s 

outreach efforts and to ensure that we are responsive to the entire population.  As we 

continue to improve the tools we use, we hope to continue to engage each of you in the 

conversation. 

In the past, collaboration often required outlays of scarce time and financial 

resources to attend face-to-face meetings.  We are increasingly exploring ways to use 

technology to effectively expand our reach.  For example, the System is using live web-

streaming to share key conferences through a YouTube channel as well as sharing 

information through webinars.  In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has 

introduced a series of podcasts with information on topics from foreclosure responses to 

perspectives on real estate.12  Finally, as noted earlier, the Board just released three video 

reports about strategies for addressing REO and vacant properties.13  If I have sparked 

your interest, I hope you will visit the Board’s website to watch the videos.   

Conclusion 

It is clear that it will take all of us working together to solve the problems that 

face communities today.  Collaboration among government, nonprofits, and our partners

in the private sector should focus on innovative ideas that can address the changing 

conditions of our communities.  As the nature of problems change, we all need to be 

flexible and modify our responses. 

Remember Professor Hargadon and his theory about innovation?  Well, he also 

stated that “social network theory divides the world into nodes and ties. You are a node 

with ties to other people you know.  The people you know have ties to each other…. If 

you can talk to a wide range of people, you are broadening your entire world, the more 

people you know, the more likely you are to be successful and happy.  This has been 

proven.… The more you share and talk to new people about your ideas, the more likely 

you are to be innovative.”14  I would like to take this final moment to encourage you to 

please make the most of your opportunities to share with your colleagues here this week, 

and to continue to push the envelope on innovation.  And I hope the Federal Reserve 

System continues to be a node of innovation with ties to each of you. 

Thank you.
