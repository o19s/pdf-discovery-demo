Thank you for inviting me to join today’s discussion.  Like many of you, I have 

long been interested in the potential for innovation to improve financial access for 

families and small businesses who are underserved.  The combination of smartphone 

apps, big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud technology holds out intriguing 

possibilities in financial services.  But no single app is likely to be a silver bullet for the 

complex challenges faced by underserved households and small businesses.  Achieving 

inclusion will require a holistic understanding of the challenges faced by underserved 

groups in order to develop full stack solutions to address them.1    

Fortunately, an emerging generation of metrics may offer a more complete picture 

of consumers’ financial needs.  In addition, technological infrastructure is developing, 

such as faster payment systems, along with the potential for more transparent and simpler 

product offerings enabled by richer data and lower-cost processing.  These new building 

blocks may make a difference on their own--and, more importantly, may be combined in 

powerful ways to bring end-to-end solutions to financial inclusion.  I will briefly discuss 

each of these developments in turn. 

Lessons from the First Wave 

Let’s start with the basic question of how to measure financial inclusion in order 

to evaluate the impact of financial innovations and inclusion policies.  The World Bank’s 

Global Findex Database starts with a seemingly reasonable proxy for financial inclusion: 

access to financial accounts.  Having access to basic transaction and savings accounts has

been shown to be an important step to financial inclusion, particularly in developing 

countries.  For instance, a 2013 experiment provided savings accounts to a random 

sample of market vendors in Kenya, most of whom were women.  The vendors with 

accounts saved at a higher rate and invested 60 percent more in their businesses relative 

to those who did not have accounts.2  Similarly, women-headed households in Nepal 

ultimately spent more on nutritious foods and education when they received free savings 

accounts relative to those who did not.3  

Using account access as a proxy for financial inclusion suggests substantial 

progress has been made.  According to the Findex Database, over two-thirds of adults 

around the globe now have some form of financial account, up from roughly half just 

seven years ago.4  This represents an increase of 800 million people.  Here in the United 

States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC’s) most recent survey of 

unbanked and underbanked households found that 7 percent of U.S. households in 2015 

were “unbanked.”5  The unbanked rate was nearly a percentage point lower than the prior 

survey in 2013 and is lower than in earlier years.  Even with this modest improvement,

however, lower-income and minority households have substantially higher rates of being 

unbanked.  

The widespread adoption of mobile phones and the data they generate are 

expected to extend these gains even further.  The World Bank noted, for instance, that 

about 1.1 billion unbanked people, about two-thirds of the unbanked population, has a 

mobile phone.6  Here in the United States, the Federal Reserve Board’s 2015 Survey of 

Consumers’ Use of Mobile Financial Services found that nearly 60 percent of the U.S. 

adult population had a smart (internet-enabled) phone. 7   It also found that the rates of 

mobile banking usage are higher among minorities.  And even amongst the unbanked 

population, 40 percent of adults had access to a smartphone in their households; the same 

was true for 70 percent of underbanked adults.  

Another proxy used to gauge financial inclusion is access to credit.  When I 

worked on microcredit 3 decades ago, it was very difficult to scale up the provision of 

loans to small businesses.8  Reaching small enterprises and evaluating their 

creditworthiness was very expensive, especially in small cities and rural areas, and it was 

difficult to secure loans with collateral.  The high transaction costs were reflected in 

interest rates many times greater than those available for established businesses in urban 

areas.

Today, new technologies are lowering transaction costs by automating the 

customer interface and underwriting processes.  A recent analysis by staff at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Atlanta notes that automated fintech platforms have lower operating 

costs relative to storefront payday lenders.9  A recent study by staff at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of New York finds that fintech lenders process mortgages on average 

20 percent faster than traditional lenders.  Of course, these differences focus on costs and 

do not address loan pricing.10  

But alongside these promising developments, we have also learned some 

cautionary tales from the early wave of fintech.  In particular, while access to accounts 

and to credit may be beneficial, they are by no means sufficient to ensure financial 

resilience on their own.    

Not surprisingly, access to an account is only a small part of achieving financial 

health.  The Findex database itself notes that a quarter of all accounts worldwide are 

“inactive,” meaning that there were no deposits or withdrawals made over the prior 

12 months.  In some cases, customers that are provided financial accounts quickly return 

to the cash economy.  For example, in 2014, India launched an ambitious financial 

inclusion program with the goal of connecting every citizen to a basic bank account that

facilitated the opening of 240 million accounts.  Before too long, however, it became 

evident that over a quarter of the new accounts held balances of one rupee or less.11     

As for credit, fintech lending has moved beyond niche to the mainstream.  In 

2010, fintech lenders made only 1 percent of personal loan originations in the United 

States.  By mid-2017, fintech lenders--often in conjunction with bank partners--were 

responsible for nearly a third of the personal loan market.12  It is not clear how much of 

this fintech lending is making a significant dent in financial inclusion, as opposed to 

serving prime and near-prime consumers in the United States.13  A 2017 study by 

TransUnion found that fintech lenders focused 59 percent of their originations in the near 

prime and prime risk tiers by the end of 2016--up marginally over the previous two 

years.14  Researchers at the Federal Reserve Banks of Philadelphia and Chicago found 

that at least some fintech lenders were able to slot “some borrowers who would be 

classified as subprime by traditional criteria” into better loan grades.15  But the 

differences from existing channels may not be large: TransUnion found that around

10 percent of loans originated by fintech lenders were to subprime consumers, as 

compared to 14 percent for the overall market for personal loans.  

What We Are Learning About Financial Inclusion 

Account access and credit may be helpful and possibly even necessary 

components of a solution.  But they are unlikely to provide a complete solution on their 

own.  Continued progress on financial inclusion is likely to require solutions that are 

designed with an understanding of the issues that underserved communities face.  

In particular, it appears that many unbanked or underbanked people in the United 

States are intentionally choosing not to maintain a bank account, which may hold clues to 

what underserved families and small businesses actually need.  The data show that nearly 

half of the unbanked households actually had bank accounts in the past, based on a 2015 

FDIC survey.16  A third of these previously banked households explained that they 

currently did not have bank accounts because of high or unpredictable fees, as did 

roughly a fifth of unbanked households that previously did not have accounts.  The single 

most cited reason for not having accounts was not having “enough money.”  More than 

10 percent of the unbanked explained that they simply “don’t trust banks.”  Those 

findings were echoed at an international level by the Findex database, where roughly a 

fifth of adults without a financial account cited a lack of trust in the financial system.17  

To explore why consumers would choose to use alternative financial services over 

traditional bank accounts, Lisa Servon of the University of Pennsylvania worked for both

a check-cashing firm and a payday lender.18  Servon observed that check-cashing firms 

used simple fee structures that were transparent and prominently displayed, similar to an 

overhead priced menu at a fast-food restaurant.  As a result, individuals could understand 

clearly what fees they will have to pay up front.  In contrast, checking accounts can be 

more unpredictable.  The funds from a deposited check may not be immediately 

available.  By the same token, it may not be clear exactly when the funds associated with 

a payment by check are likely to be deducted from the account.  That lack of 

predictability can be extremely important to a family that is living paycheck to paycheck.   

Bouncing a rent check, phone payment, or utility payment can have a 

destabilizing impact on day-to-day life with further knock-on effects and costs.  When a 

check for a utility payment is rejected due to insufficient funds, for instance, the account 

holder may have to make time-consuming calls to get the lights turned back on, while 

also struggling to pay the associated overdraft fee.  That may, in turn, lead to a vexing 

chain of additional late payments and fees.  A 2013 study by the Bureau of Consumer 

Financial Protection found that more than a quarter of checking accounts in the study 

experienced at least one overdraft fee in 2011.19  The average fee total for overdrawn 

accounts was $225, but varied as much as $200 between banks.  Among bank customers 

who bounced checks, a relatively small minority bore the brunt of the fees:  A quarter of

accounts with overdrafts incurred in 2011 had more than 10 overdraft fees during that 

year.20  

It is increasingly clear that financial inclusion is less about account access and 

more about families’ financial resilience in the face of volatile income and expenses.  It is 

common to assess households’ earnings and living expenses in terms of annual totals.  

But what keeps many people up at night is their ability to pay this week’s bills, especially 

when their paycheck is not coming until next week.  

The U.S. Financial Diaries Project finds that the low- and moderate-income 

families studied experienced fluctuations in income either 25 percent above or below 

average for five months over the course of a year.  Nearly a third of households whose 

annual incomes were twice the supplemental poverty measure dipped below the poverty 

line for at least one month during the year.21  The Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of 

Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED) similarly finds that 10 percent of all 

adults self-reported that they struggled to pay their bills at least once in the past year due 

to volatile income.22  Jonathan Morduch and Rachel Schneider, the principal investigators

of the Financial Diaries, argue that access to steady, predictable cash flows is an 

important source of financial inequality.23   

Expenses can be just as unpredictable as income, and financial fragility results 

from the mismatch between the two.  The Pew Charitable Trusts showed that 60 percent 

of households self-reported that over the prior 12 months, they had experienced at least 

one financial shock, like a job change, divorce, major illness, or breakdown of a car or 

major household appliance.24  The median household spent half-a-month’s income on the 

most expensive shock (the median expense being $2,000).  Further complicating things, 

expense shocks rarely occur on their own, but instead can cascade into additional 

expenses and stress for families on the margins.  Pew showed that a third of households 

they studied self-reported two or more different financial shocks over the course of a 

year.25  Morduch and Schneider found that 65 percent of spending spikes involved 

increases in two categories of expenses, such as transportation and health care.  In more 

than half of the spending spikes they studied, spending was well above average in three 

categories.26  Moreover, the spikes in expenses tended not to coincide with corresponding 

spikes in income.

Financially vulnerable families typically do not have sufficient savings to smooth 

through the income and expense volatility mismatches they experience.  Households in 

the Financial Diaries expected to spend more than 80 percent of their savings within the 

year. 27  Nearly half of households studied by the Pew Charitable Trust had not recovered 

from financial shocks at least six months afterward.28  And the Federal Reserve SHED 

finds that 40 percent of adults report they would have difficulty covering an unexpected 

expense of $400.29  

This inability to plan for the future dramatically affects individuals’ ability to 

engage in the investments, such as cutting back on work hours to pursue education and 

training, and the risk-taking that is necessary to improve their financial lives.30 

Access to credit can be an important part of weathering these shocks.  The Federal 

Reserve SHED finds that families with less access to credit are more likely to self-report 

financial hardship due to income volatility.31  But credit is only useful if consumers have 

the means to repay the debt in a timely manner and stabilize their financial lives.  

Research increasingly shows that borrowers often choose lenders based on their

perceived chance of being approved for funding rather than on the cost or their ability to 

repay the debt.  The Federal Reserve System’s 2017 Small Business Credit Survey finds 

that this is one of the most appealing features of online lenders for small business 

borrowers.32  With regard to consumers, a 2014 report by the Bureau of Consumer 

Financial Protection found that 80 percent of payday loans are rolled over or followed by 

another loan within 14 days.33  The Bureau found that many loan sequences end quickly, 

but 15 percent of new loans are followed by others--and half of all loans were part of a 

sequence of at least 10 loans.  

Full Stack Financial Inclusion for Financial Health 

A sustainable solution is likely to require a comprehensive understanding of the 

needs of financially underserved families and small businesses.  Accordingly, 

policymakers and financial services providers are beginning to assess financial inclusion 

in more nuanced ways.  And, in parallel, new technological building blocks increasingly 

can be used to build more full-stack approaches to financial inclusion.  

When considering how to think about progress, we are seeing a move away from 

basic financial inclusion to a more holistic understanding of financial health.  Financial 

health is more difficult to measure than bank accounts, and policymakers and researchers 

are learning how to better work with that complexity.  For instance, when the Bureau of

Consumer Financial Protection released the findings of its research on financial well-

being, it included a 10-item Financial Well-Being Scale Questionnaire, a self-evaluation 

tool designed to help an individual think comprehensively about his or her financial life.34  

The questionnaire asks consumers to rate statements such as “I can enjoy life because of 

the way I’m managing my money” and “I am securing my financial future.”  

Similarly, this April, the Center for Financial Services Innovation announced the 

launch of a new data set that uses subjective consumer responses to survey questions and 

pairs that information with actual data on their financial transactions.35  The regularly 

refreshed data is designed to give industry, researchers, and policymakers better insight 

into consumers’ financial lives by providing more accurate metrics for assessing changes 

over time.  The new initiative, which they call “Financial Health Pulse,” aims to bring the 

siloes of a consumer’s financial life into one comprehensive picture, encompassing 

“income, spending, savings, debt, retirement, and credit scores.”   

Just as we are learning how to assess financial health more effectively, we are 

also seeing progress on tools that are specifically designed to address the challenges 

underlying financial inclusion.  Moreover, these tools can be built upon a new generation

of platforms and other basic building blocks, which can be used in combination to 

develop more effective full-stack solutions.   

Within the Federal Reserve System, we recognize that we have a role and, 

potentially, a responsibility to help create an infrastructure that facilitates safe, 

innovative, and ubiquitous faster payment services.  Earlier this month, we announced 

that we are seeking public comment on whether the Reserve Banks should take a more 

active role in modernizing our infrastructure to support interbank settlement of faster 

payments in real time.36   

For households living paycheck to paycheck, the difference between waiting for a 

payment to clear and receiving a payment in real time is not merely an inconvenience; it 

could tip the balance toward overdraft fees, bounced checks, or collection fees.  Of 

course, faster payments would not address the root causes of financial fragility, but they 

could help reduce the strain on some.37   

In addition, many small businesses cite immediate access to working capital to 

finance inventories or pay employees as their number one constraint on growth.  If a 

small business could count on its customers’ payments being immediately accessible in 

its bank account, it could reduce the need for short-term financing to cover the costs of 

ordering materials and goods well in advance.   

This could also make a difference for the many hourly wage employees that 

receive their pay in the form of paper checks.  Electronic payments currently can take

multiple days to process, so if an employer seeks to ensure that an employee receives 

their pay on the last day of a pay period, the employer usually has to release the funds a 

few days in advance.  With hourly employees, it can be hard to know how much pay is 

owed until the hours are actually worked.  So employers may wait until the last day of the 

pay period and then release a paper check at the end of the day, potentially leading to 

delays for the employee in receiving the funds or a fee to obtain immediate availability.38  

Faster payment systems can change that.  Employers would be able to push funds 

to employees shortly after their shifts have ended.  Indeed, some “gig economy” 

employers have begun to offer “instant pay” options that allow contractors to cash out 

their earnings as frequently as five times a day.39  But when these options recently 

stopped working for about a week, news reports cited comments from drivers that were 

hindered in their ability to refuel, pay rent, or buy groceries because they were 

temporarily unable to access their pay as they earned it.40 

We are similarly seeing infrastructure-level innovations in the basic accounts 

offered to consumers.  Many of the recent mobile apps provided by bank and fintech 

providers, separately or in partnership, enable consumers to check balances, pay bills, and

deposit checks around the clock and every day of the week via their phones.  Some banks 

have introduced innovative online-only accounts that are fee-free and require no 

minimum deposits, while offering phone-based deposits, account interfaces, and bill 

payment.41   

Some banks offer no-fee, phone-based accounts that incorporate savings and 

budgeting tools that look and feel like nonbank fintech apps.  Consumers can set goals 

and ask that the account begin “automatically” saving toward those objectives.42  For 

example, consumers might be able to swipe to see how much they can safely spend on a 

purchase without falling behind on their financial goals or missing scheduled payments.  

With other tools, using just their phone, a customer can set rules for their bank account, 

ranging from declining transactions that would overdraw the account, to automatically 

transferring funds from a related account, to opening an overdraft line of credit, or being 

charged a fixed-dollar overdraft fee, with a one-day grace period to avoid the fee.  

New platforms like faster payment systems have the potential to combine with 

other technological improvements, like cheap access to cloud computing and an open-

source approach to artificial intelligence, to create more full-stack approaches to financial 

inclusion.  A new generation of offerings experiments with using machine-learning tools 

and data aggregation to study consumers’ expense and income flows in order to offer

credit to consumers with little to no traditional credit histories.43  As mentioned earlier, 

other apps are using faster payments and cheap accounts to offer consumers tools to 

smooth volatility in their incomes.44  Still other products are using behavioral economics-

based “nudges” to help consumers grow their savings.45  

It is still very early, and many of these products have difficult issues to work 

through with respect to consumer data security and privacy, which may have important 

implications for pricing of services.  Again and again, we are reminded that when 

products are free, the consumers themselves may be the product.  For instance, many 

financial apps that provide “free” services earn revenue by being paid for lead generation.  

Other apps may sell consumer data in ways that consumers may not be aware of.46  For 

some workers, their employers may be able to be part of the solution, by subsidizing 

some or all of the costs of using these new tools.  For example, some employers are 

partnering with fintechs to offer their employees better savings tools and the ability to 

draw emergency funds as an advance on their paycheck.  

While financial innovation may hold great promise, a lot of work is needed to 

ensure it will be able to reach communities that lack infrastructure for digital service 

delivery.  In the colonias area on the Texas-Mexico border, I met with families that are

unbanked, students that could not complete their homework, and businesses that could 

not serve customers outside their local area because they lacked the internet connectivity 

that many of us take for granted.47  The Federal Reserve, and other federal banking 

agencies, view access to technology as increasingly essential to households and small 

businesses in underserved low- and moderate-income communities.  That is why we have 

clarified that efforts to provide communications infrastructure, such as broadband internet 

service, may be viewed favorably under the Community Reinvestment Act or CRA.48   

Expanding access to financial services is most effective when consumers and 

small businesses are equipped with the ability and information to determine which 

financial products are suitable for their needs.  Financial literacy and consumer 

protections are critically important regardless of whether financial services are delivered 

through traditional means or smartphone apps.  Here too, digital delivery can expand the 

reach of traditional financial education systems by providing consumers with online and 

mobile education, just-in-time information, and interactive financial tools to evaluate 

their options.   

Financial services providers have an affirmative obligation to deliver clear and 

transparent products and services and to protect the personal information and financial 

assets of the customers they serve.  Our challenge as regulators is to ensure trust in

financial products and services by maintaining the focus on consumer protection, while 

supporting responsible innovation that provides social benefits.49 

It is too early to tell if many of these innovations will ultimately make good on 

their promise to help underserved consumers navigate their complex financial lives.  And, 

of course, no app can solve a persistent gap between living expenses and real wages in 

some occupations, sectors, or counties.  

Still, I am cautiously optimistic. Together, we are developing a more holistic 

understanding of the financial needs of underserved households and small businesses.  

We are seeing the development of powerful new technologies.  There is reason to hope 

these new technologies will be combined in ways that move the needle on financial 

inclusion.
