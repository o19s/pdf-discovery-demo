I am pleased to speak to a group that has such a distinguished record of 

identifying crucial issues related to the federal budget and working toward bipartisan 

solutions to our nation’s fiscal problems.  Today I will briefly discuss the fiscal 

challenges the nation faces and the importance of meeting those challenges for our 

collective economic future.  I will then conclude with some thoughts on the way forward. 

Fiscal Policy Challenges 

At about 9 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), the federal budget deficit 

has widened appreciably since the onset of the recent recession in December 2007.  The 

exceptional increase in the deficit has mostly reflected the automatic cyclical response of 

revenues and spending to a weak economy as well as the fiscal actions taken to ease the 

recession and aid the recovery.  As the economy continues to expand and stimulus 

policies are phased out, the budget deficit should narrow over the next few years.   

Unfortunately, even after economic conditions have returned to normal, the nation 

faces a sizable structural budget gap.  Both the Congressional Budget Office and the 

Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget project that the budget deficit will be 

almost 5 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2015, assuming that current budget policies are 

extended and the economy is then close to full employment.1  Of even greater concern is 

that longer-run projections that extrapolate current policies and make plausible 

assumptions about the future evolution of the economy show the structural budget gap 

increasing significantly further over time.  For example, under the alternative fiscal 

scenario developed by the Congressional Budget Office, which assumes most current 

policies are extended, the deficit is projected to be about 6-1/2 percent of GDP in 2020 

and almost 13 percent of GDP in 2030.  The ratio of outstanding federal debt to GDP,

expected to be about 69 percent at the end of this fiscal year, would under that scenario 

rise to 87 percent in 2020 and 146 percent in 2030.2  One reason the debt is projected to 

increase so quickly is that the larger the debt outstanding, the greater the budgetary cost 

of making the required interest payments.  This dynamic is clearly unsustainable. 

The nation’s long-term fiscal imbalances did not emerge overnight.  To a 

significant extent, they are the result of an aging population and fast-rising health-care 

costs, both of which have been predicted for decades.  The Congressional Budget Office 

projects that net federal outlays for health-care entitlements--which were 5 percent of 

GDP in 2010--could rise to more than 8 percent of GDP by 2030.  Even though projected 

fiscal imbalances associated with the Social Security system are smaller than those for 

federal health programs, they are still significant.  Although we have been warned about 

such developments for many years, the difference is that today those projections are 

becoming reality. 

A large and increasing level of government debt relative to national income risks 

serious economic consequences.  Over the longer term, rising federal debt crowds out 

private capital formation and thus reduces productivity growth.  To the extent that 

increasing debt is financed by borrowing from abroad, a growing share of our future 

income would be devoted to interest payments on foreign-held federal debt.  High levels 

of debt also impair the ability of policymakers to respond effectively to future economic 

shocks and other adverse events.   

Even the prospect of unsustainable deficits has costs, including an increased 

possibility of a sudden fiscal crisis.  As we have seen in a number of countries recently,

2020 and 127 percent of GDP in 2030.

interest rates can soar quickly if investors lose confidence in the ability of a government 

to manage its fiscal policy.  Although historical experience and economic theory do not 

show the exact threshold at which the perceived risks associated with the U.S. public debt 

would increase markedly, we can be sure that, without corrective action, our fiscal 

trajectory is moving the nation ever closer to that point. 

Perhaps the most important thing for people to understand about the federal 

budget is that maintaining the status quo is not an option.  Creditors will not lend to a 

government whose debt, relative to national income, is rising without limit; so, one way 

or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to stabilize the federal budget must occur at 

some point.  These adjustments could take place through a careful and deliberative 

process that weighs priorities and gives individuals and firms adequate time to adjust to 

changes in government programs and tax policies.  Or the needed fiscal adjustments 

could come as a rapid and much more painful response to a looming or actual fiscal crisis 

in an environment of rising interest rates, collapsing confidence and asset values, and a 

slowing economy.  The choice is ours to make. 

Achieving Fiscal Sustainability 

The primary long-term goal for federal budget policy must be achieving fiscal 

sustainability.  A straightforward way to define fiscal sustainability is as a situation in 

which the ratio of federal debt to national income is stable or moving down over the 

longer term.  This goal can be attained by bringing spending, excluding interest 

payments, roughly in line with revenues, or in other words, by approximately balancing 

the primary budget.  Given the sharp run-up in debt over the past few years, it would be 


 - 4 -

reasonable to plan for a period of primary budget surpluses, which would serve 

eventually to bring the ratio of debt to national income back toward pre-recession levels.  

Fiscal sustainability is a long-run concept.  Achieving fiscal sustainability, 

therefore, requires a long-run plan, one that reduces deficits over an extended period and 

that, to the fullest extent possible, is credible, practical, and enforceable.  In current 

circumstances, an advantage of taking a longer-term perspective in forming concrete 

plans for fiscal consolidation is that policymakers can avoid a sudden fiscal contraction 

that might put the still-fragile recovery at risk.  At the same time, acting now to put in 

place a credible plan for reducing future deficits would not only enhance economic 

performance in the long run, but could also yield near-term benefits by leading to lower 

long-term interest rates and increased consumer and business confidence. 

While it is crucial to have a federal budget that is sustainable, our fiscal policies 

should also reflect the nation’s priorities by providing the conditions to support ongoing 

gains in living standards and by striving to be fair both to current and future generations.  

In addressing our long-term fiscal challenges, we should reform the government’s tax 

policies and spending priorities so that they not only reduce the deficit, but also enhance 

the long-term growth potential of our economy--for example, by increasing incentives to 

work and to save, by encouraging investment in the skills of our workforce, by 

stimulating private capital formation, by promoting research and development, and by 

providing necessary public infrastructure.  We cannot reasonably expect to grow our way 

out of our fiscal imbalances, but a more productive economy will ease the tradeoffs that 

we face.

Making Fiscal Plans 

It is easy to call for sustainable fiscal policies but much harder to deliver them.  

The issues are not simply technical; they are also closely tied to our values and priorities 

as a nation.  It is little wonder that the debates have been so intense and progress so 

difficult to achieve. 

Recently, negotiations over our long-run fiscal policies have become tied to the 

issue of raising the statutory limit for federal debt.  I fully understand the desire to use the 

debt limit deadline to force some necessary and difficult fiscal policy adjustments, but the 

debt limit is the wrong tool for that important job.  Failing to raise the debt ceiling in a 

timely way would be self-defeating if the objective is to chart a course toward a better 

fiscal situation for our nation. 

The current level of the debt and near-term borrowing needs reflect spending and 

revenue choices that have already been approved by the current and previous Congresses 

and Administrations of both political parties.  Failing to raise the debt limit would require 

the federal government to delay or renege on payments for obligations already entered 

into.  In particular, even a short suspension of payments on principal or interest on the 

Treasury’s debt obligations could cause severe disruptions in financial markets and the 

payments system, induce ratings downgrades of U.S. government debt, create 

fundamental doubts about the creditworthiness of the United States, and damage the 

special role of the dollar and Treasury securities in global markets in the longer term.  

Interest rates would likely rise, slowing the recovery and, perversely, worsening the 


 - 6 -

deficit problem by increasing required interest payments on the debt for what might well 

be a protracted period.3 

Some have suggested that payments by the Treasury could be prioritized to meet 

principal and interest payments on debt outstanding, thus avoiding a technical default on 

federal debt.  However, even if that were the case, given the current size of the deficit and 

the uneven time pattern of government receipts and payments, the Treasury would soon 

find it necessary to prioritize among and withhold critical disbursements, such as Social 

Security and Medicare payments and funds for the military.  Moreover, while debt-

related payments might be met in this scenario, the fact that many other government 

payments would be delayed could still create serious concerns about the safety of 

Treasury securities among financial market participants.  The Hippocratic oath holds that, 

first, we should do no harm.  In debating critical fiscal issues, we should avoid 

unnecessary actions or threats that risk shaking the confidence of investors in the ability 

and willingness of the U.S. government to pay its bills. 

In raising this concern, I am by no means recommending delay or inaction in 

addressing the nation’s long-term fiscal challenges--quite the opposite.  I urge the 

Congress and the Administration to work in good faith to quickly develop and implement 

a credible plan to achieve long-term sustainability.  I hope, though, that such a plan can 

be achieved in the near term without resorting to brinksmanship or actions that would 

cast doubt on the creditworthiness of the United States. 

What would such a plan look like?  Clear metrics are important, together with 

triggers or other mechanisms to establish the credibility of the plan.  For example,

Treasury cannot make payments on a relatively small amount of maturing securities is presented by Zivney 
and Marcus (1989).

policymakers could commit to enacting in the near term a clear and specific plan for 

stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP within the next few years and then subsequently 

setting that ratio on a downward path.  Indeed, such a trajectory for the ratio of debt to 

GDP is comparable to the one proposed by the National Commission on Fiscal 

Responsibility and Reform.4  To make the framework more explicit, the President and 

congressional leadership could agree on a definite timetable for reaching decisions about 

both shorter-term budget adjustments and longer-term changes.  Fiscal policymakers 

could look now to find substantial savings in the 10-year budget window, enforced by 

well-designed budget rules, while simultaneously undertaking additional reforms to 

address the long-term sustainability of entitlement programs.  Such a framework could 

include a commitment to make a down payment on fiscal consolidation by enacting 

legislation to reduce the structural deficit over the next several years.   

Conclusion 

The task of developing and implementing sustainable fiscal policies is daunting, 

and it will involve many agonizing decisions and difficult tradeoffs.  But meeting this 

challenge in a timely manner is crucial for our nation.  History makes clear that failure to 

put our fiscal house in order will erode the vitality of our economy, reduce the standard 

of living in the United States, and increase the risk of economic and financial instability.
