Good afternoon.  It is a great pleasure for me to join the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 

City in welcoming you to the Federal Reserve Board for the 2019 National Agricultural Credit 

Conference.  For nearly 80 years, these meetings have been at the forefront of important 

discussions for those with a stake in agricultural lending, with the first National Agricultural 

Credit meeting held in 1941.  At that time and with war looming, there was a clear need to ensure 

that our nation’s farmers had the resources and capability to support the nation in the wake of the 

great depression, deflation, and the dust bowl.  This meeting provided a vital forum for candid 

conversation, to exchange information, and to forge relationships that would enable lenders to 

take steps to ensure a sound future for agriculture--a future supported by the efficient and 

effective provision of credit.    

In the decades since that first meeting, this conference has seen a number of boom and 

bust cycles in agriculture, most often the result of volatile swings in commodity prices, land price 

valuations, and borrowing costs for agricultural business owners.  Through all of these 

challenges, this conference has provided an important opportunity to promote a greater 

understanding of emerging issues in agricultural finance.  Further, the success of these meetings 

largely depends on the interactions of everyone here today, so I want to thank you for attending 

and for participating.  I am honored to welcome you to the first conference meeting to be held at 

the Federal Reserve Board. And I’m pleased to support this group’s mission to foster discussion 

on issues pertaining to ag finance, and I look forward to meeting with you and learning from the 

discussion.   

Today and tomorrow, we will discuss recent developments in agricultural credit markets.  

We will also hear from presenters on topics that connect in various ways to the agricultural 

sector.  I am especially pleased to see there is a special focus on rural communities at this year’s 

meeting.  As many of you know, this topic holds a special place in my heart.  My family has deep 

roots in rural Kansas and a long history in farming, ranching, and ag banking.  I have spent much 

of my life and career living, working, and raising a family in a rural area.

Rural communities are critical for our nation for many reasons including food production 

and processing, manufacturing, and leading innovation in these industries.  According to the U.S. 

Census Bureau, 97 percent of the country’s land mass is rural, and about 60 million Americans 

call a rural community their home.1  To put that number in perspective, the rural population of the 

United States is larger than the combined populations of the New York, Los Angeles, and 

Chicago metro areas.  If we were talking about the economies of those great cities, we’d stress 

their regional differences, the complexities of demographic change, and the distinct challenges 

each city faces to remain vibrant and innovative.  When the focus shifts to the rural economy, 

however, the discussion tends to be overly broad and simplistic.  The diversity and complexity of 

our vast rural communities too often gets lost--and I think that needs to change.   

There are challenges in rural communities.  We know them all too well.  There is a 

notable gap in access to broadband.  As of 2016, 31 percent of Americans in rural areas were not 

able to access broadband compared to just 2 percent of Americans in urban areas.2  This can have 

a significant business impact on ag producers--for example, limiting access to internet-based 

cattle auctions or inhibiting the ability of dairies to leverage technology to remotely access animal 

nutritionists to formulate feed to maximize milk production.  

 Many rural schools struggle to attract and keep qualified teachers who can teach STEM 

and advanced math classes.  These subjects are vital to preparing our children for the 

opportunities and challenges of a more competitive and technological workplace.3

One in five people in rural areas have a bachelor’s degree, compared to one in three in 

urban areas.4  This educational disparity helps explain why the employment-to-population and 

labor force participation rates in rural areas are lower than in many urban areas.5 Another 

contributing factor to low rural labor force participation is the opioid crisis, which the entire 

nation is struggling to overcome.   

Policymakers need to be aware of and be willing to confront these issues.  But let me be 

clear:  I am optimistic about the future of rural America.  The narrative of rural decline is too 

sweeping and brushes aside the diversity of the rural experience.  Just as many cities thrive while 

others struggle, there are deteriorating rural communities and rural communities that are thriving 

and growing.   

So let’s build on these successes and highlight a few of the positives. 

Following six years of steady population losses, up through 2016, the rural population 

appears to have stabilized.  And while employment is growing more slowly in rural areas than in 

urban areas, rural unemployment has recovered and is now 1 percentage point below pre-

recession levels.6  The rate of poverty in rural areas is also falling.  From a peak in 2013, the rural 

poverty rate has fallen 2 percentage points to 16.4 percent in 2017.   

There are also many creative and innovative rural communities.  In manufacturing, 

innovation rates are similar for urban and rural manufacturers, although the services sector in 

rural areas lags its urban counterparts.7  And, I am greatly encouraged to see younger generations 

choosing to live in and return to their roots in rural communities, just as my family and I chose to

do.  These younger generations are often seeking a rural lifestyle and a deeper connection to a 

smaller community--a community where they can have a lasting impact.  They are bringing with 

them the same innovative spirit they bring to so many industries.  For example, some of these 

young entrepreneurs and farmers are capitalizing on the recent trend for broader access to locally 

produced and sourced food.        

Which brings us back to our focus today:  agriculture is the foundation for many rural 

economies and it is the central topic for this conference.  Current conditions in agriculture appear 

to be stable, though at a low level of income, following sharp declines for several years from the 

peak in 2013.  The prices of major agricultural commodities have also remained low in early 

2019.   For example, today, the price of corn is about 40 percent less than it was from 2010 to 

2013.   

As noted in the Federal Reserve’s latest Financial Stability Report, farmland values are at 

exceptionally high levels, though down from their 2016 peak.  And price-to-rent ratios are at 

historic highs.  At the same time, equity levels at many farms are higher than in the past.  We also 

see above-trend yields are helping to support many operators, though working capital at many 

farms has fallen along with incomes.  Although the increase in problem loans associated with 

lower incomes has been modest, the Federal Reserve is monitoring the risk that has emerged in 

recent years.   

One risk that we are actively monitoring is the recent and devastating flooding in the 

Midwest and its effect on both agriculture and rural communities across the region. Our thoughts 

and prayers are with all those who live in the areas affected by this disaster.  I would be especially 

interested to hear your thoughts on how the flooding may affect agricultural operations and how 

lenders are currently responding. 

The topics you are discussing today are integral to my role as governor.  On Thursday, I 

will be visiting with and speaking to farmers and community bankers in Deming, New Mexico.  

An important part of my job is to hear directly from leaders like you and others across this

country to better understand current challenges facing your communities, your companies, and 

your industry.  My goal is to bring back the knowledge I gain from these discussions to inform 

and improve our work to support both the financial sector engaged in agricultural lending and our 

mission as the central bank of the United States.    

I hope that conferences like this will help generate a richer discussion about the 

challenges and unique advantages in rural America so we can develop more creative, effective 

and direct policy responses.  A deeper debate that, for example, distinguishes between low-

density and higher-density rural areas, between rural communities that are relatively isolated and 

those that are connected and close to thriving cities, will help us develop more durable solutions.   

Before I close, I want to thank you again, as well as the many people at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Kansas City and from the Federal Reserve Board who helped organize this 

year’s conference. Thanks to all of you for your work to ensure continued success for American 

agriculture.
