Challenges for the Economy and State Governments

at the 
 

Annual Meeting of the Southern Legislative Conference  
of the Council of State Governments 

 
Charleston, South Carolina 


August 2, 2010



It is a pleasure to be able to address this conference of southern leaders and 

legislators.  As some of you may know, I was raised only about 150 miles from here in 

Dillon, South Carolina, and remain connected to this area through family ties. 

Our nation has endured a deep recession that in turn was triggered by the most 

severe financial crisis since the Great Depression.  Today, the financial crisis appears to 

be mostly behind us, and the economy seems to have stabilized and is expanding again.  

But we have a considerable way to go to achieve a full recovery in our economy, and 

many Americans are still grappling with unemployment, foreclosure, and lost savings. 

The recession--as all of you know too well--has also battered the budgets of state 

and local governments, primarily because tax revenues have declined sharply.  Many 

states and localities continue to face difficulties in maintaining essential services and 

have significantly cut their programs and work forces.  These cuts have imposed 

hardships in local jurisdictions around the country and are also part of the reason for the 

sluggishness of the national recovery.  

Today, I will touch on current economic and financial conditions and then turn to 

some near-term and longer-term challenges--fiscal and otherwise--facing state 

governments.   

The Economic Outlook 

After a precipitous decline in late 2008 and early 2009, the U.S. economy 

stabilized in the middle of last year and is now expanding at a moderate pace.  While the 

support to economic activity from stimulative fiscal policies and firms’ restocking of 

their inventories will diminish over time, rising demand from households and businesses 

should help sustain growth.  In particular, in the household sector, growth in real 


 - 2 - 

consumer spending seems likely to pick up in coming quarters from its recent modest 

pace, supported by gains in income and improving credit conditions.  In the business 

sector, investment in equipment and software has been increasing rapidly, in part as a 

result of the deferral of capital outlays during the downturn and the need of many 

businesses to replace aging equipment.  At the same time, rising U.S. exports, reflecting 

the expansion of the global economy and the recovery of world trade, have helped foster 

growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector.  

To be sure, notable restraints on the recovery persist.  The housing market has 

remained weak, with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home 

prices and new construction.  Similarly, poor economic fundamentals and tight credit are 

holding back investment in nonresidential structures, such as office buildings, hotels, and 

shopping malls. 

Importantly, the slow recovery in the labor market and the attendant uncertainty 

about job prospects are weighing on household confidence and spending.  After two years 

of job losses, private payrolls expanded at an average of about 100,000 per month during 

the first half of this year, an improvement but still a pace insufficient to reduce the 

unemployment rate materially.  In all likelihood, significant time will be required to 

restore the nearly 8-1/2 million jobs that were lost over 2008 and 2009.  Moreover, nearly 

half of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than six months.  Long-term 

unemployment not only imposes exceptional near-term hardships on workers and their 

families, it also erodes skills and may have long-lasting effects on workers’ employment 

and earnings prospects.

Financial conditions--though much improved since the depth of the financial 

crisis--have become somewhat less supportive of economic growth in recent months.  

Notably, concerns about the ability of Greece and a number of other euro-area countries 

to manage their sizable budget deficits and high levels of public debt roiled global 

financial markets in the spring, including our own.  In response to these fiscal pressures, 

European leaders put in place a number of strong measures, including an assistance 

package for Greece and backstop financing for euro-area countries.  And, recently, 

European banking supervisors released the results of comprehensive stress tests of their 

banks.1

Like financial conditions generally, the state of the U.S. banking system has also 

improved significantly since the worst of the crisis.  Loss rates on most types of loans 

seem to be peaking, and, in the aggregate, bank capital ratios have risen to new highs.  

However, many banks continue to have a large volume of troubled loans, and bank 

lending standards remain tight.  With credit demand weak and with banks writing down 

problem credits, bank loans outstanding have continued to decline.  Small businesses, 

which depend importantly on bank credit, have been particularly hard hit by restrictive 

lending standards.  At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to facilitate the flow of 

funds to creditworthy small businesses.  Along with the other banking supervisors, we 

have emphasized to banks and examiners that lenders should do all they can to meet the 

needs of creditworthy borrowers, including small businesses.

  On net, these measures appear to have reduced concerns in financial markets 

about European prospects.

extensive training of our bank examiners, with the message that lending to viable small 

businesses is good for the safety and soundness of our banking system as well as for our 

economy.  We will continue to monitor bank lending and to seek feedback from banks 

and borrowers.  

Inflation has been low, with consumer prices rising at an average annual rate of 

about 1 percent in the first half of this year, and we anticipate it will remain subdued over 

the next couple of years.3

Fiscal Challenges for State Governments   

  Slack in labor and product markets has damped wage and price 

pressures, and rapid productivity increases have helped firms control their production 

costs.  Meanwhile, measures of expected inflation generally have remained stable. 

 Cuts in state and local programs and employment are also weighing on economic 

activity.  These cuts principally reflect the historically large decreases in state tax 

revenues during the recession.  Sales tax revenues have declined with household and 

business spending, and income tax revenues have been hit by drops in wages and salaries, 

capital gains, and corporate profits.  In contrast, property tax revenues collected by local 

governments generally held up well through the beginning of this year, although 

reappraisals of the values of homes and commercial properties may affect those 

collections in the future.  For the 15 states represented in the Southern Legislative

Conference (SLC), state tax revenues fell roughly 10 percent in 2009, similar to the 

average of all states.4

Medicaid spending is another source of pressure on state budgets.  The recession 

and the weak job market have swelled the rolls of Medicaid participants.  In 2009, 

caseloads were 11 percent above their 2007 level in the region represented by the SLC, 

again similar to the average in all states.  


With revenues down and Medicaid spending up, other categories of spending by 

state governments have been tightly squeezed.  Over the past year, numerous state 

governments have laid off or furloughed employees, decreased capital spending, and 

reduced aid to local governments.  Indeed, state and local payrolls have fallen by more 

than 200,000 jobs from their peak near the end of 2008.  Some states have also raised 

taxes, but the weak economy has made it difficult to find significant new revenues.   

Assistance from the federal government, especially through the fiscal stimulus 

package, has eased, but certainly not eliminated, the budget difficulties faced by states.  

Although states and localities will continue to receive significant aid this year, that source 

of help will be winding down next year. 

On a more positive note, state and local tax revenues seem set to increase as 

economic activity expands.  Indeed, 11 of the 15 states of the SLC reported earlier this 

year that they expect fiscal year 2011 revenues to be at least somewhat higher than the 

previous fiscal year.5

of the demands on Medicaid and other social services.  Moreover, the municipal bond 

market has remained reasonably receptive this year to most borrowers, with rates low and 

new issuance relatively solid, despite the concerns about the fiscal positions of many state 

and local governments.  All that being said, with economic conditions still far from 

normal, state budgets will probably remain under substantial pressure for a while, leaving 

governors and legislatures a difficult juggling act as they try to maintain essential 

services while meeting their budgetary obligations. 

A question for the longer run is whether the vulnerability of state budgets to 

business-cycle downturns can be ameliorated.  The pressures that states face during and 

after a recession are the result, in part, of balanced-budget rules in state constitutions that 

prohibit the use of long-term borrowing to cover operating budget shortfalls, a constraint 

not faced by the federal government, as you know.  I do not advocate changing the 

balanced-budget rules followed by 49 of the 50 states; they provide important discipline 

and are a key reason that states have not built up long-term debt burdens comparable to 

those of many national governments.  However, as is the case today, these rules may 

force significant state cutbacks in bad economic times when services are most needed.  

Moreover, many government programs--in areas such as education or health care, for 

example--are likely to be most effective when funding sources are stable and predictable, 

allowing for longer-term planning.  

Tools exist to help mitigate the effects of the business cycle on state budgets.  

Many states deal with revenue fluctuations by building up reserve--or “rainy day”--funds 

during good economic times.  Measured as a percent of general fund expenditures, the 

aggregate reserve fund balances for all state governments stood at a record of about 


 - 7 - 

12 percent at the end of 2006; the states represented by the SLC had accumulated above-

average reserves of around 16 percent.  These high reserve-fund balances were helpful in 

lessening the severity of spending cuts or tax increases in many states.  Nevertheless, 

given the depth of the recent recession, even these historically high reserve-fund balances 

proved insufficient to buffer fully the budgets of most states.  Thus, state governments 

may wish to revisit their criteria for accumulating fiscal reserves.  Building a rainy-day 

fund during good times may not be politically popular, but it can pay off during the bad 

times. 

In principle, some smoothing of state government expenditures over time could 

take place through the capital budget.  Maintaining or even increasing the pace of 

infrastructure construction when the economy is weak fosters economic development and 

provides local jobs, and it may even allow the state to get more bang for the buck because 

of increased competition among private contractors when demand is slack.  However, 

voters and policymakers may understandably be reluctant to approve new bond issues 

and take on additional costs for debt payments in a period of fiscal and economic stress. 

Beyond balanced-budget rules, state government finances also fluctuate because 

of the increasing sensitivity of their revenues to changes in economic conditions.  For 

example, capital income, which tends to vary substantially more than wage and salary 

income, has over time become a relatively more important source of state personal 

income taxes.6

  Also, sales taxes that understandably exempt certain necessities may also 

lead to more cyclicality in collections.  As state legislatures review their tax systems, they

may wish to consider revenue stability along with other critical features of the tax code 

such as fairness, support for economic growth, and administrative costs. 

Of course, healthy economic growth can ease state and local fiscal problems--and 

federal fiscal problems, for that matter.  Notwithstanding the very difficult near-term 

budget issues you face, I urge you not to take your eye off the important goal of 

promoting growth.   

A basic economic principle is that growth requires investment.  Investment 

includes physical investment such as infrastructure development; surely, adequate 

transportation networks and the like are necessary for economic growth.  But for 

sustained economic development, investment in people--in their knowledge and skills--is 

even more important.  No economy can succeed without a high-quality workforce, 

particularly in an age of globalization and technical change.  I think this is a lesson that 

the South, as a region, has learned quite well.  When I attended public schools in South 

Carolina in the 1960s, measures of per-pupil spending, years of schooling, and student 

achievement in the South lagged significantly behind other parts of the country.  Since 

then, those indicators have changed, very much for the better.  Because of the concerted 

efforts of state and local governments, high school completion rates in the South have 

gradually converged to the national average.  Southern colleges and universities have 

become more prominent nationally and internationally, and we have seen the emergence 

of leading centers of education and innovation, such as the Research Triangle Park area 

in North Carolina and the high-tech area around Austin, Texas.  Economic progress and a 

high quality of life have in turn attracted educated workers and new industries.  


 - 9 - 

Doubtless, investment in education and training has been a key source of the remarkable 

economic gains that the South has achieved over the past 50 years or so.  

I am confident that, in light of this experience, your efforts to improve education 

and workforce skills will continue.  As you do that, please keep in mind that formal K-12 

and post-secondary education, as important as they are, do not alone build better 

workforces.  Research increasingly has shown the importance for both individuals and 

the economy as a whole of both early childhood education as well as efforts to promote 

the lifelong acquisition of skills.  The payoffs of early childhood programs can be 

especially high.7  For instance, investment in preschool programs for disadvantaged 

children has been shown to increase high school graduation rates.  Because high school 

graduates have higher earnings, pay more taxes, and are less likely to need to use public 

health programs, such investments can pay off even from the narrow perspective of state 

budgets; of course, the returns to the overall economy and to the individuals themselves 

are much greater.8

Additionally, in a dynamic economy in which job requirements are constantly 

changing, individuals already in the workforce need opportunities to improve their skills 

throughout their lives.  There are many ways to provide such opportunities.  For example, 

community colleges and vocational schools play essential roles in training and retraining 

workers, especially if they do so in close collaboration with private employers, and they 

do so at a relatively low cost.  State governments can facilitate public-private

of Minnesota and the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, at www.humancapitalrc.org.

collaboration to help individuals gain skills that the market demands.  Though creating 

opportunities for workers to retrain is always important, it is especially critical now, 

when the high rate of long-term unemployment threatens the longer-term employability 

and productivity of many. 

Providing economic opportunity and rising living standards for as many people as 

possible is, of course, the fundamental rationale for continued economic development.  

From the perspective of government finances, however, healthy local economies will also 

be necessary if state governments are to successfully confront some difficult, longer-term 

fiscal issues.  As you know, with the retirement of state employees that are part of the 

baby-boom generation and the continued rise in health-care costs, states’ retiree pension 

and health-care obligations will become even more difficult to meet in coming years.  

Estimates of states’ unfunded pension liabilities span a wide range, but some researchers 

put the figure as high as $2 trillion at the end of last year.9  States’ unfunded liabilities are 

significantly higher than before the recession and financial crisis because many pension 

fund investments have declined in value, and because many states have found it difficult 

to maintain pension contributions while their budgets are under stress.  Indeed, some 

estimates suggest that, on average, states would need to more than double their typical 

annual pension contributions over the next decade to avoid collectively exhausting their 

pension funds during the next couple of decades. 10

Liabilities in State and Local Plans (Chestnut Hill, Mass.:  Center for Retirement Research at Boston 
College, June), available at http://crr.bc.edu/briefs/valuing_liabilities_in_state_and_local_plans.html. 

  This daunting problem has no easy 

solution; in particular, proposals that include modifications of benefits schedules must

take into account that accrued pension benefits of state and local workers in many 

jurisdictions are accorded strong legal protection, including, in some states, constitutional 

protection.11

In addition to pensions, states will have to address the burgeoning cost of retiree 

health benefits.  Estimates of these liabilities are subject to significant uncertainty, largely 

because we have little basis on which to project health-care costs decades into the future.  

However, one recent estimate suggests that state governments have a collective liability 

of almost $600 billion for retiree health benefits.


12

Of course, the demographic and health-care trends faced by state governments 

present severe challenges for federal fiscal policymakers as well.  Long-term projections 

of the federal government’s budget under current policies and plausible economic 

assumptions show a structural budget gap that is both large relative to the size of the 

economy and increasing over time.

  These benefits have traditionally been 

funded on a pay-as-you-go basis and therefore could entail a substantial fiscal burden in 

coming years as large numbers of state workers retire.

11 See Jeffrey R. Brown and David W. Wilcox (2009), “Discounting State and Local Pension Liabilities,” 
American Economic Review, vol. 99 (May), 538-42.  It should be noted that future pension accruals and 
health benefits generally seem to be accorded a lower level of protection. 

  To steer clear of sudden, sharp, and disruptive 

shifts in spending programs and tax policies, and to retain the confidence of the public 

and financial markets, federal policymakers need to develop a credible plan to restore 

fiscal sustainability.

The states have the opportunity to serve as role models for effective long-term 

fiscal planning.  Given the size of long-term obligations and the importance of meeting 

commitments to employees and the public, I don’t think these problems can be solved 

simply through across-the-board cuts in existing state programs.  Instead, states should 

intensively review the effectiveness of all of their programs and be willing to make 

significant changes to deliver necessary services at lower cost.  This willingness to look 

for new solutions seems especially important in the case of health programs, where costs 

are growing the most quickly. 

Conclusion 

Today I have highlighted the challenges that state legislators face, both in the 

South and in other regions.  In the past few years, the weak economy has significantly 

reduced state and local government revenues, which in turn has forced difficult decisions 

on spending and taxes.  An improving economy should help, but state finances will 

remain under pressure for some time.  In the longer term, like the federal government, 

state governments must respond to the aging of the population and the seemingly 

inexorable rise in health-care costs.  These are daunting challenges indeed, but I believe 

we can find constructive ways to meet them, and I suspect that many of these solutions 

will be found at the state level.  Dealing with the fiscal challenges at all levels of 

government will be essential to ensuring that our resilient and dynamic economy delivers 

rising living standards to the citizens of your states and to our nation as a whole.
