Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today, it is great to be back in New 

York.  The Citizens Budget Commission has played an important role over the years as a 

forum to discuss issues of interest to New Yorkers that are often also of national and even 

global importance.  Given New York’s preeminence as a center of global finance, I 

thought it would be appropriate to discuss just such a topic, which is how the Federal 

Reserve oversees the largest financial institutions, many of which are headquartered or 

have a major presence here, and how that oversight has strengthened since the financial 

crisis.1   

The Financial Crisis and Large Financial Institutions 

The crisis had many causes, including the numerous factors that drove a lengthy 

housing boom and the expansion of a largely unregulated “shadow banking system” 

rivaling the traditional banking sector in size.  A self-reinforcing financial panic 

magnified the damage from risks that had built up over many years throughout the 

country and across the financial system.   

But to a considerable extent, large and complex financial institutions were the 

epicenter of the crisis.  These institutions, some of which were not subject to Federal 

Reserve oversight at the time, were the locus for much of the excessive risk-taking that 

led to the crisis.  Due to their primacy and interconnections with the rest of the financial 

system, these large institutions were also the means by which the crisis spread quickly 

and with devastating effect through the economy.   

1 Although the Federal Reserve supervises entities with a range of legal forms, including depository 
institutions and holding companies, for the purposes of my remarks today, “financial institutions,” “firms,” 
“banks,” and “banking organizations” are used interchangeably unless indicated otherwise.

The financial crisis and the recession caused great hardship for millions of 

individuals and families in this city and in communities throughout our country.  I believe 

all Americans share a common interest in working to make sure that our financial system 

is strong, resilient, and able to serve a healthy and growing economy.  A critical part of 

our work since the crisis to promote a stable financial system has therefore involved 

greater effort to ensure that large institutions are operating safely and soundly and are 

prepared to continue serving households and businesses even when faced with stressful 

financial conditions. 

In the run-up to the crisis, large firms failed to adequately anticipate and manage 

risks that grew and concentrated in their increasingly sprawling, diverse, and complex 

operations.  Partly as a result, these firms had trouble retaining the trust of markets and 

creditors when the financial system came under stress.  Doubts quickly mounted about 

whether these institutions could sustain losses in the value of many assets they held.  

Further doubts were raised about whether these firms had enough cash and other liquid 

assets to meet the immediate or potential demands of short-term creditors and large 

institutional customers.  In the lead-up to the crisis, many large institutions had become 

heavily reliant on very short-term borrowing, at relatively low rates, to fund lending and 

other operations providing higher returns.  While this approach may have appeared to be 

an easy source of profit, it had the disadvantage of leaving those banks exposed to 

devastating runs if short-term funding dried up, as it did in the crisis.   

Large financial institutions, of course, were not alone in failing to see these risks.  

The checks and balances that were widely expected to prevent excessive risk-taking by 

large financial firms--regulatory oversight and market discipline--did not do so.  


 - 3 - 

Government agencies, including the Fed, failed to recognize the extent of the risks or 

how severely they could damage the financial system and the economy.  Investors failed 

to anticipate and understand the risks of large financial institutions’ activities that 

materialized during the crisis.   

Background on Financial Regulation and Supervision 

Before I turn to the Fed’s actions to improve oversight of large financial 

institutions, let me be clear about what I mean by “large institutions.”  Generally, I have 

in mind those firms whose financial distress would pose a significant risk to financial 

stability--firms that are, in that sense, “systemically important.”  This would include U.S. 

banking organizations with large, complex, and often international operations; foreign 

banking organizations with extensive U.S. operations; and other large and complex 

financial firms.  Today the Federal Reserve subjects 16 of those firms to significantly 

higher levels of oversight than are applied to other institutions.2  To put the scale and 

importance of these firms in perspective, the 8 U.S. bank holding companies among these 

16 firms hold nearly 60 percent of all assets in the U.S. banking system.3   

The Federal Reserve’s oversight of large financial institutions is aimed at 

ensuring the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions as well as the 

resiliency of the financial system.  The Fed expects the banks it oversees, including the 

largest banks, to be financially sound.  Two core elements of soundness are capital and 

2 A current list of these firms is available on the Federal Reserve Board’s webpage “Large Institution 
Supervision Coordinating Committee” at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-
supervision.htm.  This list may evolve based on changes in firms’ relative systemic importance.  Financial 
Stability Oversight Council determinations of nonbank financial institutions subject to Federal Reserve 
oversight are available on the U.S. Department of Treasury’s website at 
www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/designations/Pages/default.aspx.

holding companies and savings and loan holding companies.  To access the report, see the Board’s

liquidity.  Capital is the funds provided by a bank’s shareholders that serve as a buffer to 

enable the firm to absorb unexpected losses, including during times of economic 

downturn or financial stress.  A bank’s liquidity is its ability to meet current and future 

obligations to customers and others with whom it enters into financial transactions. 

Liquidity is the lifeblood of a financial firm, because once liquidity dries up, the firm is 

no longer able to operate.   

Beyond focusing on capital and liquidity, the Fed also promotes safety and 

soundness by seeking to ensure that banks are well managed and subject to strong 

governance by a board of directors responsible to shareholders.  It is unfortunate that I 

need to underscore this, but we expect the firms we oversee to follow the law and to 

operate in an ethical manner.  Too often in recent years, bankers at large institutions have 

not done so, sometimes brazenly.  These incidents, both individually and in their totality, 

raise legitimate questions of whether there may be pervasive shortcomings in the values 

of large financial firms that might undermine their safety and soundness.4   

While the Federal Reserve looks closely at the individual safety and soundness of 

large financial firms, as I noted earlier, it is not sufficient to view each of these firms in 

isolation.  The safety and soundness of large firms affects, and is affected by, the stability 

of the broader financial system.  In the decades of relative financial stability leading up to 

the crisis, it is fair to say that the Fed focused too much on individual firms and not 

enough on their role in the financial system and the implications of those firms’

operations for financial stability.  To use an apt metaphor, we looked closely at the trees 

and not as intently as we should have at the forest.  One of the most fundamental changes 

in the Fed’s oversight of large institutions since the crisis, a principle that undergirds 

everything I will discuss today, is elevating the importance of financial stability in that 

oversight.  

The Fed oversees financial institutions through regulation and supervision.  While 

they are often closely related, these are two distinct activities.  On the one hand, 

regulation refers primarily to the rules that firms must follow.  Regulation starts with 

laws passed by Congress which are the basis for specific and detailed rules written by the 

Fed and other agencies.  Supervision, on the other hand, involves monitoring and 

examining the day-to-day operations of these firms, including their financial condition, 

how they manage risks, and their corporate governance, to make sure they are complying 

with laws and regulations and operating in a safe and sound manner. 

 The Federal Reserve Board writes the regulations firms must follow, establishes 

supervisory policies and, in close collaboration with the 12 regional Reserve Banks, is 

deeply engaged in the supervision of large financial institutions.  Much of the day-to-day 

work of supervision, particularly for smaller banks, occurs locally through the Reserve 

Banks.  For systemically important firms, the Board several years ago established the 

Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) in order to assure well-

coordinated supervision.   

I consider the effective supervision of large institutions, to ensure their safety and 

soundness and the stability of the financial system, to be one of the Federal Reserve 


 - 6 - 

Board’s most important responsibilities, and one of my most important responsibilities as 

Chair. 

In improving the oversight of large firms, the Federal Reserve has made it a top 

priority to ensure that we appropriately tailor our regulation and supervision of banks to 

their size, complexity, and risks.5  We will use statutory authorities to ensure that we 

avoid a one-size-fits-all approach as we promulgate rules and regulations.  As we 

continue this work, we will communicate to the Congress should we identify discrete 

issues that may benefit from further clarification or technical changes without 

undermining safety and soundness, such as those addressed by Congress last year related 

to capital requirements for insurance companies. 

Post-Crisis Regulation and Supervision of Large Financial Institutions 

Regulatory Reform 

Regulatory changes since the crisis have been extensive.6  While my emphasis 

today is on steps taken in the United States, I should also note that we work closely with

our international colleagues to ensure that standards for systemically important financial 

firms are raised globally as well.  We have made significant progress on our regulatory 

reform agenda both domestically and internationally, but we still have work to do. 

I will briefly describe five regulatory changes that have been among the most 

important in helping the Federal Reserve improve its oversight of the largest institutions. 

First, all banks are required to hold significantly more capital, with higher 

standards applied to the largest, most systemically important firms.  Second, large 

institutions have also been required to substantially increase their liquidity.  The blueprint 

for these higher capital and liquidity standards is an international agreement known as 

Basel III, which establishes minimum standards for internationally active banks around 

the world; the United States, however, has gone even further to raise capital requirements 

for the largest firms.  Third, large firms are now required to show that they can continue 

to operate safely and serve their customers in stressful conditions similar to those that 

occurred during the crisis, an exercise known as stress testing.  Fourth, under the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), Congress 

authorized a new regime, known as “resolution,” to manage the failure of large firms in 

an orderly manner and reduce the chances that such a failure would threaten financial 

stability.  The Congress empowered the Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) to require large firms to develop resolution plans.   

The fifth and final regulatory change I want to mention is that the Dodd-Frank 

Act also gave the Federal Reserve more explicit responsibilities for safeguarding 

financial stability.  As applied to large institutions, more stringent capital requirements

and the other regulatory changes I have just described are intended to promote the 

stability of the financial system.  In addition, to address the fragmentation of 

responsibility for financial stability across different agencies, the Fed is part of a new 

interagency body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which helps U.S. regulators 

work together more effectively to better promote the stability of the financial system.   

Enhanced Supervision 

 Along with the additional tools provided by these regulatory changes, the Federal 

Reserve has fortified its supervision of large financial institutions.  We significantly 

enhanced the manner by which we assess whether these firms have sufficient capital and 

liquidity and are meeting new regulatory requirements in this area. We have substantially 

raised our expectations for how well the firms we supervise should be managing their 

risks, maintaining internal controls, and exercising governance.  And we have 

reorganized our supervision of large financial institutions to increase the quality, 

consistency, and range of perspectives brought to bear on supervisory strategy and 

decisionmaking. 

One of the most important enhancements to large bank supervision since the 

financial crisis is our assessment of whether large institutions are holding enough capital 

to deal with stressful financial conditions.  The program includes stress testing and a 

yearly review of how firms are planning their future capital needs.7  The latest results will 

be disclosed in the coming days.   

7 The Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review applies to a larger number of institutions than the most 
systemically important firms discussed in these remarks.  




 - 9 - 

Capital stress testing for banks is not new but the Federal Reserve has employed it 

much more extensively since the crisis.8  Using information on a bank’s finances and 

operations, these tests gauge how a firm’s capital position would be affected by 

hypothetical scenarios covering a range of adverse economic and financial conditions.  

Such tests show the potential harm faced by individual banks in stressful conditions and 

thus the potential that such problems could affect the stability of the financial system.  

The goal is to see that large institutions have enough capital not just to survive in these 

conditions, but also to continue serving their customers.  The Federal Reserve conducts 

stress tests once a year, and the firms are required to run their own tests and disclose 

results to the public twice a year.   

Stress testing is an important tool, but it is not sufficient to provide a full picture 

of the capital adequacy of large firms.9  The Fed also looks at other aspects of large 

banks’ capital planning, such as their risk management, internal controls, and 

governance.  If the Federal Reserve is not satisfied with the results from capital stress 

tests or identifies shortcomings in a firm’s capital planning, we may restrict the firm’s 

ability to pay dividends, buy back shares, or take other actions that would reduce its 

capital base.   

In addition to these steps related to capital, in 2012 the Federal Reserve began a 

comprehensive assessment of large banks’ liquidity.10  We review the firms’ own 

8 In addition to ad hoc stress testing that was conducted throughout the crisis, in 2009 the Federal Reserve 
and the other U.S. federal banking agencies undertook the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program at the 
19 largest U.S. bank holding companies.  This exercise played a key role in publicly identifying capital 
deficiencies at the largest firms and bolstering market confidence by requiring companies to address these 
deficiencies.  
9 For more information about the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review exercise and interagency 
Dodd-Frank Act stress-testing requirements, see the webpage “Stress Tests and Capital Planning” on the 
Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm.  
10 This Federal Reserve assessment is known as the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review. 




 - 10 - 

liquidity stress tests, and we conduct an independent assessment of their liquidity.  These 

liquidity exercises provide a regular opportunity for Fed supervisors to respond to 

evolving liquidity risks and firm practices over time.  Through this effort, we can require 

large firms to take specific actions to bolster their liquidity or enhance the way they 

manage their liquidity risks.   

Through stress testing and other improvements to supervision, the Federal 

Reserve is requiring more of large institutions.  We are also requiring more of ourselves.  

Before the crisis, the Fed’s supervision of large institutions did not make the fullest and 

most effective use of the expertise of our staff across the Federal Reserve System.  To 

improve our supervision of the largest systemically important firms, we have created the 

Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, which I mentioned earlier.  The 

LISCC brings together experts from around the Federal Reserve System in the areas of 

supervision, research, legal, financial markets, and payment systems in a centralized body 

led by the Federal Reserve Board.   

The LISCC program enhances supervision in several ways.  First, by looking at 

firms both individually and collectively, it helps ensure supervisors are well positioned to 

identify issues at individual firms as well as trends across and interconnections among 

firms that may pose risks to financial stability.  The LISCC also promotes high standards 

and consistency in the supervision of large firms through a centralized yet Systemwide 

approach.  By bringing together staff members from across the Federal Reserve System, 

the LISCC is designed to ensure that diverse views and perspectives are brought to bear 

on important decisions about the supervision of systemically important firms.  Lastly, the 

diversity of skills among the Fed experts involved in the LISCC allows it to consider 


 - 11 - 

financial stability risks from the broader economy, financial markets, and other sources.  

The LISCC also builds on the comprehensive analysis of financial stability by the 

Board’s Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, which was established after 

the financial crisis.  

The Federal Reserve has significant responsibilities for supervising large financial 

institutions, but we cannot guarantee their stability on our own.  It is important that we 

communicate and coordinate with other U.S. financial regulatory agencies with 

responsibilities that affect the safety and soundness of large institutions.  We also need to 

cooperate with supervisors in other countries where these firms operate.  This 

cooperation helps us understand developments in a complex and global financial system 

that have implications for individual firms or for large institutions generally.  It can also 

provide information and perspective about firms whose supervision we may share with 

other agencies or governments.  In addition, it facilitates a coordinated approach to 

ensuring that large firms are operating in a safe and sound manner.  

To be effective, regulation and supervision must be independent of the entities 

subject to oversight.  You may know or have heard the term “regulatory capture.”  

Regulatory capture is when a regulatory agency advances the interests of the industry it is 

supposed to oversee rather than the broader public interest it should represent.11  

Regulatory capture, which may occur in the oversight of any industry, can happen in both 

intentional and inadvertent ways.  The most blatant ways involve tangible conflicts of 

interest--for example the expectation government officials might have of future rewards 

11 A body of economic literature addresses regulatory capture, with perhaps one of the most influential 
works being George J. Stigler (1971), “The Theory of Economic Regulation,” Bell Journal of Economics 
and Management Science, vol. 2 (Spring), pp. 3-21.  See also Ernesto Dal Bó (2006), “Regulatory Capture:  
A Review,” Oxford Review of Economic Policy, vol. 22 (Summer), pp. 203-25. 




 - 12 - 

from the industry they oversee.  But experience and extensive research shows that 

regulatory capture also occurs in less tangible ways, when close contact and familiarity 

between individuals leads those enforcing the rules to sympathize with those they 

oversee.  Whatever the source, the risk of regulatory capture is something the Federal 

Reserve takes very seriously and works very hard to prevent.  We enforce strict ethics 

rules and promote strong values among our employees, among them a commitment to 

public service.  It is important that anyone serving the Fed feel safe speaking up when 

they have concerns about bias toward industry, and that those concerns be addressed.  

The broadening of expertise and participation in supervision conducted by the LISCC, as 

overseen by the Board, represents yet another check to the risk of regulatory capture in 

the oversight of large firms.  

The Results of Improved Supervision  

I believe the changes I have described have significantly improved the strength 

and stability of large financial institutions and the financial system.  

As I mentioned earlier, strong capital and liquidity are fundamental to the 

resiliency of large institutions.  The good news is that the amount and quality of capital 

and the strength of liquidity positions at large firms are greatly improved since the crisis.   

While some of the improvement in the capital positions of large firms is due to 

the regulatory changes I have described that are being phased in over the next several 

years, some of it has come as a direct result of the Fed’s capital planning and stress-

testing requirements.  From early 2009 through 2014, capital held by the eight most 

systemically important U.S. bank holding companies more than doubled, reflecting an 


 - 13 - 

increase of almost $500 billion in the strongest form of capital held by these companies.12  

Likewise, the Federal Reserve’s increased focus on liquidity has contributed to 

significant increases in firms’ liquidity.  The high-quality liquid assets held by these eight 

firms has increased by roughly one-third since 2012, and their reliance on short-term 

wholesale funding has dropped considerably.  

Beyond these very tangible gains, we see some evidence of improved risk 

management, internal controls, and governance at large firms.  But large firms still have 

room for improvement in this area, and supervisors will be watching closely.  The 

compliance breakdowns in recent years that I mentioned earlier in my remarks undermine 

confidence in large firms’ risk management and controls, which has implications for 

financial stability.  The Fed has taken and will continue to take swift and meaningful 

action to ensure that firms focus on their risk-management practices and continue to 

strengthen them. 

Both the Federal Reserve and the large firms we oversee have become more 

forward looking in evaluating these firms’ capacity to withstand significant financial 

stress, which has enhanced financial stability.  Much of this new perspective has come 

through our capital and liquidity reviews, which require both firms and supervisors to 

make financial projections into the future rather than simply relying on current and past 

performance.  Likewise, requiring firms to plan for their possible demise and orderly 

resolution has forced them to think more carefully about the sustainability of their 

business models and corporate structures.  

12 Specifically, for the period from 2009 to 2013, tier 1 common equity as defined in the Board’s regulatory 
capital regulations, and in 2014, common equity tier 1 capital, due to changes in regulatory capital 
regulations. 




 - 14 - 

We have a more consistent and industry-wide perspective on risks and 

vulnerabilities than we had prior to the crisis.  The focus on individual firms is still 

extremely important, but we now supplement this approach more systematically with 

reviews of issues across multiple firms simultaneously.  These reviews allow us to 

identify common themes and unacceptable practices among large firms that will enable 

us to take consistent and effective action.   

Lastly, I believe the resolution authority enacted by the Congress and our work 

with the FDIC on the orderly resolution of large institutions are reducing the problem of 

firms considered “too big to fail” by addressing the risks a failure of a large firm would 

pose to the financial system.  The plans developed by the largest firms to date still have a 

number of shortcomings, but the Federal Reserve has asked for and expects these 

institutions to make substantial progress in the coming months which will leave firms and 

the government better positioned to manage the failure of a large institution in an orderly 

way.13 

 The goal, through this and other actions I have described today, is to do whatever 

can be done to avert the dire threat and lasting damage of a severe financial crisis.  We 

cannot eliminate the possibility of another crisis, but we can make a crisis less likely and 

less damaging by limiting excessive risk-taking by firms we oversee and by helping 

ensure that the most systemically important firms are better prepared to weather a crisis.   

We have focused our efforts on the largest firms because they were and continue 

to be crucial to the financial system and its ability to support the financial needs of

households and businesses.  By working to promote the safety and soundness of large 

firms, the Federal Reserve is trying to ensure that these and many other banks can 

continue to serve the people of New York and every community in America.
