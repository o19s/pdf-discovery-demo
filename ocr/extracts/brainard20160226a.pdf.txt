Beginning in 2014, we saw confident predictions of a coming strong divergence 

in monetary policy among the major economies.  To date, there has been less policy 

divergence in reality than had been predicted.  This observation raises the question of 

whether there may be limits on policy divergence in current circumstances. Such limits 

might reflect common forces buffeting economies around the world or the powerful 

transmission of shocks across borders through exchange rate and other financial channels 

that may have the effect of front-running monetary policy adjustments in the vicinity of 

the zero lower bound.  Put differently, predictions that U.S. monetary policy would chart 

a notably divergent path have been tempered by powerful crosscurrents from abroad.1  

How Different Are Underlying Conditions? 

Before turning to divergences in policy, it is useful to review briefly the extent of 

differences in the underlying economic conditions in the major advanced economies.  

While the recovery from the global financial crisis has been frustratingly slow in every 

major economy, there nonetheless have been important differences in the pace and extent 

of healing.  Speaking loosely, among the advanced economies, the United States and 

United Kingdom appear farthest along in closing resource gaps, Japan is next in line, and 

the euro area has been somewhat slower to recover.  In the United States, resource 

utilization has increased substantially over the past five years.  The U.S. unemployment 

rate is now under 5 percent, compared with 10 percent at its recent peak.  Even so, there 

is evidence that some labor market slack still remains.2  The United Kingdom has

experienced a rapid drop in unemployment to 5.1 percent, as low as pre-crisis levels, and 

labor force participation has remained relatively strong.  In contrast, unemployment in the 

euro area was 10-1/2 percent in the fourth quarter, down just 1-3/4 percentage points 

from its recent peak and still well above pre-crisis levels.  Accordingly, market 

participants have expected policy in the United States and the United Kingdom to 

become less accommodative, while remaining very accommodative over the medium 

term in the euro area.3 

In Japan, expectations of monetary policy divergence have reflected Japan’s long 

period of disappointments on its inflation target to a greater extent than its remaining 

resource gap.  Japan’s unemployment rate is 3.3 percent, already below the previous 

cyclical trough, and the International Monetary Fund estimates the output gap to have 

been the same in Japan and the United States in 2015 at 1-1/2 percent.  However, with 

inflation in Japan previously having been near zero for an extended period and inflation 

expectations under pressure, the Bank of Japan’s commitment to increasing inflation 

expectations and moving inflation up to its 2 percent target has led market participants to 

expect extremely accommodative monetary policy to persist for quite a while.   

Currently, however, there are smaller differences among the major economies on 

measures of realized and expected inflation than there are on resource utilization.  In 

2015, the 12-month change in total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation in 

the United States was 0.6 percent, while headline inflation in the United Kingdom, euro 

area, and Japan were 0.2 percent.  All inflation rates are well below target.  Of course, to

the extent that the downward pressure on global inflation is due to falling oil prices, this 

pressure would be expected to abate if oil prices stabilize.   

But even after removing energy prices, core PCE inflation has come in 

consistently under the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target here in the United States and 

does not look very different from inflation in economies that are expected to maintain 

accommodative monetary policy for some time.  Core PCE inflation, or inflation 

excluding food and energy prices, has remained stubbornly in the vicinity of 1-1/4 to 1-

1/2 percent over the past three years in the United States, similar to the United Kingdom 

and not very different from the roughly 1 percent core inflation in the euro area and 

Japan. 

We also see notable similarities in the recent deterioration in market measures of 

inflation expectations.  While in the euro area, swaps-based inflation compensation has 

fallen about 3/4 percentage point since the middle of 2014 and is now around 1-1/2 

percent at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, in the United States, swaps-based 

inflation compensation has fallen 1 full percentage point over the same period and is now 

at 1-3/4 percent.  Japan has experienced a similar decline over this period, while the 

United Kingdom has seen a much more modest decline. 

With realized and expected future inflation not showing large differences, the 

expectation of monetary policy divergence between the United States, on the one hand, 

and the United Kingdom and the euro area, on the other, must rest to a large extent on 

remaining differences in resource utilization and expectations that inflation outcomes will 

diverge as a result of these differences.  However, it is important to note that the extent of 

inflation divergence generated by differences in resource utilization across countries is 


 - 4 - 

likely much smaller now than it has been in earlier decades.  Recent research suggests a 

dramatic flattening of the Phillips curve in recent decades.4  If this finding continues to 

hold true, resource utilization would need to differ more sharply across national 

economies to produce a noticeable difference in inflation. 

The persistence of relatively soft core PCE inflation readings in the United States, 

despite a substantial improvement in employment, suggests we should be cautious in 

relying on the historical relationship between employment gains and stronger inflation in 

today’s economy.  Moreover, the softening in market-based measures of inflation 

expectations and some hints of weakening in survey measures deserve our attention.  This 

deterioration in inflation expectations and a weakened link between labor market 

tightening and inflation--together with the asymmetry of policy in the vicinity of the 

lower bound--lead me to put a high premium on evidence that actual inflation is firming 

sustainably.  

Putting these pieces of evidence together suggests that if core inflation remains 

below target in all major advanced economies and inflation expectations remain under 

pressure in many, I might expect policy divergence to remain more limited than 

previously predicted. 

Common Conditions 

To the extent that we are observing limited divergence in inflation outcomes and 

less divergence in realized policy paths than many anticipated, this could be attributable 

to common shocks or trends that cause economic conditions to be synchronized across 

                                                 
4 In the United States, for example, Blanchard (2016) estimates that the slope of the Phillips curve has 
declined by more than two-thirds since the 1970s.  Other recent research includes Blanchard, Cerutti, and 
Summers (2015) and Kiley (2015b).

economies.  The sharp repeated declines in the price of oil have been a major common 

factor depressing headline inflation and are also likely feeding into low core inflation, 

although to a lesser extent.5  As noted previously, these price declines have led headline 

inflation across the globe to behave quite similarly over this time period.  Even so, most 

observers expect this source of convergence in inflationary outcomes to eventually fade 

and thereafter not affect monetary policy paths over the medium term.   

In contrast, a more persistent source of convergence may be found in an apparent 

decline in the neutral rate of interest.  The neutral rate of interest--or the rate of interest 

consistent with the economy remaining at its potential rate of output and inflation 

remaining at target level--appears to have declined over the past 30 years in the United 

States and is now at historically low levels.6  Similarly, longer-run interest rates appear 

also to have fallen across a broad group of advanced and emerging market economies, 

suggesting that neutral rates are at historically low levels in many countries around the 

world and near or below zero in the major advanced foreign economies.7  Although the 

reasons for the declines in neutral rates are not perfectly understood and may differ across 

countries, there are some common drivers, such as slower productivity and labor force 

growth and a heightened sensitivity to risk.8   

                                                 
5 In five of the six quarters since mid-2014, the price of oil has decreased for a cumulative decline of 
70 percent.   
6 See Brainard (2015b), Hamilton and others (2015), Kiley (2015a), Laubach and Williams (2015), and 
Johannsen and Mertens (2016). 
7 See Hamilton and others (2015), Del Negro and others (2015), and chapter 3 of World Economic Outlook 
(International Monetary Fund, 2014). 
8 While the empirical link between potential growth and the neutral rate is not precisely estimated, the 
evidence suggests that slower trend growth is associated with lower interest rates; see Laubach and 
Williams (2015) and Hamilton and others (2015).  U.S. labor force growth has slowed from 1 percent from 
2001 to 2004 to 1/2 percent over the most recent 4 years.  Over the same periods, euro-area growth has 
slowed from 1.3 percent to 0.4 percent.  In Japan the labor force was essentially flat from 2011 to 2015, 
though this was a slight improvement from a small rate of decline in the early 2000s.  Productivity growth 
over the same periods has slowed from 3.0 percent to 0.5 percent in the United States, from 0.6 percent to 
0.2 percent in the euro area, and 1.5 percent to 0.5 percent in Japan.

The very low levels of the shorter run neutral rate reflect in part headwinds from 

the crisis that are likely to dissipate over time.  However, if many of the common forces 

holding down neutral rates prove persistent, then neutral rates may remain low through 

the medium term, implying a shallower path for policy trajectories. 

The global economy is also experiencing a downshift in emerging market growth 

momentum led by China, which may prove somewhat persistent.  Whereas earlier in the 

recovery there was a striking divergence between the relatively buoyant growth in major 

emerging economies and depressed growth in advanced economies, lately the extent of 

divergence has diminished noticeably.9  China is undergoing a challenging set of 

economic transitions.  Trend growth has slowed substantially and is expected to slow 

further, and the composition of growth is shifting away from resource-intensive 

manufacturing and exports toward a greater share for consumption and services.  China’s 

investment has slowed sharply recently after accounting for nearly one-third of global 

investment over the past three years and about one-half of global consumption in certain 

metals such as iron ore, aluminum, copper, and nickel.  Commodity exporters and close 

trading partners in Asia will be most affected, but the changes in the composition and rate 

of growth in a country that has accounted for about one-third of the growth in world  

output and trade will likely ripple through the global economy much more generally. 

                                                 
      Regarding sensitivity to risk, the risk premium for capital investment appears to have increased since 
the crisis; see Del Negro and others (2015).  A higher risk premium requires a lower risk-free rate to 
generate an equivalent level of investment.   
9 From the end of 2009 to the end of 2013, growth in important U.S. emerging market trading partners 
averaged 4.7 percent, while growth in advanced economies averaged 1.8 percent.  However, in 2014 
emerging country growth slowed to 3.3 percent, compared with 1.6 percent in advanced economies, and for 
the first three quarters of 2015, annualized growth was 2.5 percent and 1.1 percent, respectively.

Amplified Spillovers   

Of course, policy divergence among major economies could be limited by rapid 

and strong transmission of foreign shocks across borders.  In particular, although the U.S. 

real economy has traditionally been seen as more insulated from foreign trade shocks 

than many smaller economies, the combination of the highly global role of the dollar and 

U.S. financial markets and the proximity to the zero lower bound may be amplifying 

spillovers from foreign financial conditions.  By one rough estimate, accounting for the 

net effect of exchange rate appreciation and changes in equity valuations and long term 

yields, over the past year and a half, the United States has experienced a tightening of 

financial conditions that is the equivalent of an additional increase of over 75 basis points 

in the federal funds rate.10   

The transmission of divergent economic conditions across borders typically 

occurs though a couple of different channels.  First, a decline in demand in one country 

reduces its demand for imports from other countries.  Second, the fall in economic 

activity would be expected to trigger a more accommodative monetary policy, which 

helps offset the effect of the shock by both supporting domestic demand and weakening 

the exchange rate.  The weaker exchange rate in turn leads domestic consumers to switch 

their expenditures away from more expensive foreign imports to cheaper domestic 

products while increasing the competitiveness of exports.  The extent to which monetary 

policy offsets the shock by dispersing it to trade partners as opposed to strengthening 

                                                 
10 These estimates are based on rough rules of thumb regarding the effects on output of changes in long-
term interest rates, equity prices, the exchange rate, and the federal funds rate from the FRB/US model and 
assume a highly persistent change in the federal funds rate.  Some private-forecaster estimates of financial 
tightening--expressed in terms of the federal funds rate--are larger, which may reflect an assumption of a 
less persistent funds rate change.  An alternative estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 
DSGE model, which explicitly includes a financial sector, suggests the tightening in financial conditions 
since mid-2015 is equivalent to an increase in the federal funds rate of roughly 100 basis points.

domestic demand depends on the responsiveness of domestic demand relative to the 

exchange rate.  The exchange rate channel, by raising the price of imports in domestic 

currency, also pushes up domestic inflation and exerts downward pressure on foreign 

inflation. 

The strength of spillovers across countries and the extent to which that affects 

policy divergence across countries depend on a foreign economy’s openness to these 

different channels.  The recent experience of Sweden suggests that for highly open 

economies, the effect of foreign shocks can be extremely powerful.11  Sweden’s 

economic growth has been relatively rapid recently, reaching nearly 4 percent over the 

most recent four quarters.  Moreover, the employment gap is estimated to be nearly 

closed, and there are signs of financial excess in the housing market.  In ordinary times, 

these conditions would be consistent with relatively tight monetary policy.  However, 

inflation has run persistently well below the central bank’s 2 percent inflation target.  

Given the relative openness of Sweden’s economy, moving the inflation rate back up to 

target has been greatly complicated by the sensitivity of Sweden’s exchange rate and 

financial conditions to developments in the euro area, where domestic economic 

conditions are consistent with much more accommodative policy.  As a result, the 

Riksbank has been pursuing extremely accommodative monetary policy, most recently 

lowering the interest rate on deposits to minus 0.5 percent and authorizing the Governor 

and Deputy Governor to intervene in foreign currency markets.   

Even in the much larger United States economy, with imports accounting for a 

little over 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), spillovers can be quite strong, in 

                                                 
11 Imports and exports each account for a little under one-half of Sweden’s GDP.

part reflecting the international role of U.S. financial markets and the dollar.  Since the 

middle of 2014, with a reassessment of demand growth in the euro area and subsequently 

in emerging markets and other commodity exporters, the real trade-weighted value of the 

dollar has increased nearly 20 percent.  As a result, in 2014 and 2015, net exports 

subtracted a little over 1/2 percentage point from GDP growth each year, and 

econometric models point to a subtraction of a further 1 percentage point this year.12  In 

addition, the dollar’s appreciation is estimated to have put significant downward pressure 

on inflation:  Non-oil import prices fell 3-1/2 percent in 2015, subtracting an estimated 

1/2 percentage point from core PCE inflation.13   

Financial channels can powerfully propagate negative shocks in one market by 

catalyzing a broader reassessment of risks and increases in risk spreads across many 

financial markets.  Since the beginning of the year, U.S. financial markets have reacted 

strongly to adverse news on emerging market growth, even though the news on the U.S. 

labor market has remained positive.  In this regard, although China’s direct imports from 

the United States are modest, uncertainty about changes to its exchange rate system and 

financial imbalances, together with changes in the composition of its growth, have had 

broader global spillovers that may pose risks to the U.S. outlook.   

Recent events suggest the transmission of foreign shocks can take place extremely 

quickly such that financial markets anticipate and indeed may thereby front-run the 

expected monetary policy reactions to these developments.  It also appears that the 

exchange rate channel may have played a particularly important role recently in 

transmitting economic and financial developments across national borders.  Indeed,

recent research suggests that financial transmission is likely to be amplified in economies 

with near-zero interest rates, such that anticipated monetary policy adjustments in one 

economy may contribute more to a shifting of demand across borders than a boost to 

overall demand.14  This finding could explain why the sensitivity of exchange rate 

movements to economic news and to changes in foreign monetary policy appear to have 

been relatively elevated recently.   

Financial tightening associated with cross-border spillovers may be limiting the 

extent to which U.S. policy diverges from major economies.  As policy adjusts to the 

evolution of the data, the combination of heightened spillovers from weaker foreign 

economies, along with a lower neutral rate, could result in a lower policy path in the 

United States relative to what many had predicted. 

Policy 

In circumstances where many economies face common negative shocks or where 

negative shocks in one country are quickly transmitted across borders, it is natural to 

consider whether coordination can improve outcomes.  Under certain conditions--such as 

flexible exchange rates, deep and well-regulated financial markets, and flexible product 

and labor markets--policies designed for the domestic economy can readily offset any 

spillovers from economic conditions abroad, and policies designed to address domestic 

conditions can achieve desirable outcomes both within the national economy and more 

broadly.15   

In some circumstances, however, cooperation can be quite helpful.  If, for 

example, economies face a common challenge, coordination can communicate to markets 

                                                 
14 See Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2015). 
15 See Brainard (2015a).

that policymakers recognize the challenge and will work to address it.  Reducing 

uncertainty about the direction of policy and addressing concerns about policies working 

at cross-purposes can boost the confidence of businesses and households.  With 

intensified transmission effects in the vicinity of the zero lower bound, there is a risk that 

uncoordinated policy on its own could have the effect of shifting demand across borders 

rather than addressing the underlying weakness in global demand.  The difficult start to 

the year should be a prompt for greater policy coherence and clarity.  This might be a 

good time for policymakers to reaffirm their commitment to work toward the common 

goal of strengthening global demand. 

Similarly, with anemic global demand and interest rates near zero, in some 

economies there is scope for monetary policy to be more effective with fiscal policy 

working in the same direction. With potential growth and nominal borrowing rates both 

low, public investment that increases potential in the longer run and demand in the 

shorter run could make an important contribution.  A joint determination by policymakers 

across major economies to better deploy policy tools to provide support for global 

demand could be beneficial.
