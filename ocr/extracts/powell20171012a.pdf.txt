Thank you for inviting me to speak here at the Institute of International Finance 

Annual Membership meeting.  I am pleased to note that there have been signs lately that 

a sustainable global recovery may finally be materializing.  This is certainly good news, 

although significant risks and uncertainties remain.  One important question is how the 

emerging market economies (EMEs) will fare as global monetary conditions normalize.  

In our intertwined world, prospects for these economies are a significant driver of 

prospects for the United States and other advanced economies.  In my remarks today I 

will argue that, despite the risks and uncertainties, EMEs are likely to manage that 

normalization reasonably well.  

As many observers have noted, EME economic prospects are strongly linked to 

the evolution of capital flows.1  Accordingly, I will first review the recent rebound in 

EME capital inflows and analyze the drivers of this rebound.  Against this backdrop, I 

will then discuss how the prospects for EMEs depend on three factors:  Vulnerabilities in 

the EMEs themselves; the evolution of advanced-economy monetary conditions, 

including those in the United States; and market responses to that evolution.  As always, 

my comments here represent my own views.   

The Rebound in Economic Growth and Capital Flows in Emerging Markets  

After real GDP growth plummeted in many EMEs during the Global Financial 

Crisis (GFC), economic activity rebounded sharply (slide 1).  But that recovery proved to 

be short lived and was followed by a notable, widespread fall in EME growth as 

advanced economies remained sluggish, economic imbalances in China mounted, and 

commodity prices plunged.  Lately, however, the streak of weak growth in the EMEs

appears to have been broken:  The downward trend in Chinese growth has flattened, 

growth in other EMEs has picked up some, and Brazil seems to be moving into recovery 

mode.  The factors that underlie the pickup in EMEs to a large extent represent a reversal 

of developments that led to the slowing.  The improvement in the performance of the 

advanced economies has become more widespread.  Chinese authorities have bolstered 

their economy by providing more credit stimulus.  And commodity prices have bounced 

back from their lows in early 2016, bolstering activity and allaying financial stability 

concerns in commodity-exporting economies.  These developments have also contributed 

to a modest reversal of the slowdown in global trade seen in recent years.2   

A rebound in capital flows has come along with the pickup in economic 

performance in the EMEs.  Slide 2 shows net private capital flows to EMEs--the 

difference between gross private inflows and gross private outflows.  These private net 

inflows are quite volatile, as the experience of the past 10 years shows.  Strong pre-GFC 

net inflows to major emerging markets (the black line)--hovering in the neighborhood 

of 3 to 4 percent of EME gross domestic product (GDP)--were interrupted by a collapse 

during the crisis, but inflows quickly recovered and stayed strong through 2010.  After 

that, net inflows trended down for several years and turned negative by 2015.  Part of this 

retrenchment reflected Chinese net inflows turning into net outflows due to what might 

be considered special circumstances—notably, changes in expectations of Chinese 

exchange rate policy.  But even taking China out of the picture, as shown by the dashed 

blue line, there was a clear downward trend in net inflows.   

                                                 
2 For more on the global trade slowdown, see Powell (2016).

Over the past couple of years, however, net inflows have recovered and have 

averaged, if China is excluded, 0.7 percent of GDP in 2016 and about 1-1/2 percent of 

GDP in early 2017.  As shown in slide 3, other measures of capital flows, such as flows 

into EME investment funds, show an even sharper rebound.   

The recent recovery of investor appetite for EME exposure has shown up in asset 

prices as well.  Emerging-market credit spreads have declined, and equity prices have 

risen (slide 4).  These developments are not occurring in isolation, but in the context of a 

general improvement in the global outlook and in investor risk sentiment.  The 

improvement in economic fundamentals raises the following question:  To what extent 

can the recent recovery in EME capital flows be explained by these better economic 

fundamentals?   

One way to shed light on this question is to compare the recent behavior of EME 

capital flows with what we might expect from a model of these flows based on historical 

data.  In a recent study, Federal Reserve staff regressed net private capital inflows into 

several key EMEs on measures of investment opportunities in these economies, monetary 

policy variables, and risk sentiment variables.3  As can be seen in slide 5, by comparing 

the solid and dashed lines, the model does a fairly good job overall of fitting the data.   

It is instructive to look at what the model tells us about the slowing of flows 

between 2010 and 2015.  Note that the falloff in commodity prices (the red portion of the 

                                                 
3 The specific variables in the regression include the GDP growth differential between EMEs and advanced 
economies, commodity prices, EME interest rate differentials with advanced economies, measures of the 
Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing, the VIX (which is the one-month-ahead option-implied volatility of 
the S&P 500 index), and country-specific emerging market credit spreads (see Clark and others, 2016). 
Note that, because of special factors driving its flows over the past few years, China is not included in this 
analysis. Other studies that have also examined determinants of EME capital flows include International 
Monetary Fund (2016b), Koepke (2015), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Fratzscher (2012), and Ghosh and 
others (2012).  Generally, these papers find that many factors, including both “pull” and “push,” affect 
EME capital flows.

bars) was the largest contributor to the slowdown in flows.  The decline in economic 

growth differentials between the EMEs and advanced economies (the yellow portions) 

was also a major contributor.  In fact, growth differentials became a slightly negative 

contributor in 2015 after being substantially positive in 2010.4  Monetary policies (the 

blue portions) also became less of a factor in 2015 in driving flows to EMEs.   

As for the recent rebound in flows, over the past year the model’s predicted net 

inflows (the dashed line) have actually been significantly above actual net inflows (the 

solid line), suggesting that there is some room for flows to increase further without 

raising concerns.  The model attributes the recovery of flows primarily to the turnaround 

in commodity prices and, to a substantially lesser extent, to improvements in risk 

sentiment (as seen by some waning of the negative contribution from the slashed green 

bars).  The growth differential is not playing a major role because the rise in EME growth 

has been accompanied by a rise in advanced-economy growth.5   

All in all, this evidence suggests that the recent pickup of capital flows to EMEs 

has not outrun its fundamental determinants, which provides some encouragement that 

these flows will not reverse themselves and endanger EME prospects, a situation that is 

also encouraging for U.S. prospects.   

                                                 
4 This negative contribution reflects that the average growth differential between the selected group of 
EMEs, which does not include China, and the advanced economies itself became negative.  
5 Variants of the model applied to gross capital inflows, rather than net capital inflows, give qualitatively 
similar results.  In particular, the model of gross flows also finds that the pickup in these flows has been 
less strong than predicted by the model.  However, the relative contribution of the risk variables to the 
pickup in EME flows relative to the turnaround in commodity prices is somewhat larger with the gross 
flows model than the net inflows model.  The consequences of net versus gross flows for the recipient 
economies can potentially differ as, for example, Cavallo and others (2015) have argued.

Risks to Emerging Market Economy Prospects from the Future Course of Monetary 

Policy 

Some observers have noted that the risk of a reversal of EME capital flows may 

become more pronounced as U.S. and global interest rates return to more normal levels.  

These developments could encourage capital to return to the advanced economies and, by 

raising domestic interest rates and putting downward pressures on emerging market 

currencies, could also enlarge EME debt burdens.  In assessing this risk, as I mentioned 

earlier, three elements are important:  first, the vulnerabilities in the EMEs themselves; 

second, the evolution of advanced-economy monetary policies; and, third, how markets 

might respond to that evolution.  Let me discuss each of these elements in turn.  

Emerging Market Economy Vulnerabilities 

There is clear empirical evidence that the response of EME financial markets to 

different shocks, including changes in U.S. interest rates, depends importantly on the 

state of economic fundamentals in the EMEs themselves.  For example, Bowman and 

coauthors document in their study that a deterioration in a country’s economic conditions 

significantly increases its vulnerability to adverse effects from changes in U.S. interest 

rates.6  A case in point is the so-called taper tantrum in 2013, when rises in sovereign 

bond spreads were significantly greater in those EMEs with greater relative 

vulnerabilities.   

There is little doubt that over the past couple of decades, EME macroeconomic 

fundamentals and policy frameworks have improved substantially.  One way you can see 

                                                 
6 See Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2015).  Other papers that have looked at the effects of U.S. 
monetary policies on EME asset prices and the channels through which these effects are transmitted include 
Bruno and Shin (2015); Chen, Mancini-Griffoli, and Sahay (2014); Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub 
(2013); Tepper and others (2013); and Hausman and Wongswan (2011).

this improvement is through an index of aggregate EME vulnerability (the black line in 

slide 6), which is based economic data on a variety of variables from 13 major 

economies.7  According to this index, EME vulnerabilities today stand well below those 

in the 1990s--a period during which financial crises in EMEs were much more prevalent.   

That said, the vulnerability index has been trending up since 2008.  Part of this 

increase in the vulnerability index can be attributed to a run-up in bank credit to the 

private sector, which brings me to a key risk for EME prospects:  the position of EME 

corporates.  Observers have been expressing concerns about the mounting levels of 

corporate debt and the risk that a normalization of global conditions could exacerbate 

debt service burdens of EME corporations--particularly those with elevated levels of 

dollar-denominated debt--by raising global interest rates, boosting the value of the dollar, 

and perhaps damping economic activity.  Given the prominence of this risk, I will discuss 

EME corporates in a bit more detail.   

Since 2008, the debt of EME nonfinancial corporations has tripled in dollar value, 

reaching roughly $27 trillion in the first quarter of 2017.  As a share of GDP, as shown by 

the black line in slide 7, it has nearly doubled, to over 100 percent of GDP.  China’s 

situation is distinct from many other EMEs.  On the one hand, as can be seen by the red 

line, its corporate debt, at 170 percent of GDP now, is much higher than most other 

EMEs and substantially above the level we saw in East Asia before the Asian crisis.  On 

the other hand, Chinese corporates are much less exposed to changes in exchange rates 

and global interest rates.   

                                                 
7 Variables used in creating the index include external debt, the current account position, foreign reserves, 
public debt, control of inflation, and bank credit to the private sector. 


 - 7 - 

But the rising amount of debt by itself does not tell us whether this debt is 

excessive and how vulnerable EME corporates are to global monetary and market shocks.  

For that assessment we need to drill down deeper into the health of the corporate sector.  

In a recent study, Beltran and coauthors undertake such an analysis using a common 

metric of debt service capacity--the interest coverage ratio, or ICR, which is the ratio of 

earnings to interest expense.8  All else being equal, this ratio is lower for firms that are 

less profitable, more leveraged, and have a higher cost of borrowing.  Using firm-level 

data, the authors classify the debt of those firms with an ICR of less than 2 as “debt-at-

risk.”9  They find, as shown by the black line in slide 8, that this measure of risky EME 

corporate debt has almost tripled since 2011 to about 30 percent of GDP.  But this share 

is still considerably lower than the 46 percent of GDP debt-at-risk in East Asia on the eve 

of the Asian crisis (the horizontal dashed black line in the chart).  For China, though, the 

debt-at-risk now exceeds what we saw in East Asia before the Asian crisis.  Outside of 

China (the dashed blue line), EME debt-at-risk, at about 10 percent of GDP, seems much 

more manageable.  However, as can be seen by the blue portions of the bars in slide 9, 

debt-at-risk in a number of EMEs, including South Korea, India, Turkey, and Brazil 

exceeds that average level.   

How will EME corporate debt fare going forward as global normalization 

proceeds?  The results of the study I just discussed imply that a 1 percentage point 

increase in EME corporate borrowing costs by itself would not be so problematic, at least 

                                                 
8 See Beltran, Garud, and Rosenblum (2017).  Other studies that have recently investigated EME corporate 
vulnerabilities include Alfaro, Chari and Panizza (2017); International Monetary Fund (2014, 2016a); and 
Chow (2015).   
9 An ICR of 2 or less is often associated with increased likelihood of distress.  For example, just before the 
Asian financial crisis, firms in Indonesia, South Korea, and Thailand had an average ICR of 2 (see 
Pomerleano, 1998).

outside of China.10  What this shock would do to debt-at-risk is shown by the red 

cross-hatched portions of the bars in the chart.  But it would be a bigger deal if the rise in 

borrowing costs was accompanied by a more generalized adverse turn of events in EMEs, 

modeled here as a 20 percent earnings reduction and a 20 percent hit to the value of EME 

currencies against the dollar.  The estimated effects of these additional shocks on debt-at-

risk are shown by the slashed red portions of the bars.11  In this case, aggregate EME 

debt-at-risk rises from about 30 percent of GDP to around the level seen prior to the 

Asian financial crisis.12  Notably, the increase comes mainly from China, where 

debt-at-risk jumps to about 85 percent of GDP.  Outside of China, risky debt also rises 

substantially but seemingly not to levels that would be considered unmanageable.   

Overall, based on this analysis, I would conclude that corporate debt represents a 

moderate degree of vulnerability for EME prospects.  The situation is not alarming, but 

risks are significant and bear close watching, especially in China.   

The Evolution of Federal Reserve Policy  

What of the evolution of monetary conditions in the advanced economies?  I will 

confine myself here to Fed policy.  One factor that favors easier adjustment in EMEs is 

                                                 
10 A 1 percentage point positive shock to the borrowing costs of EME corporates undoes about half of the 
decline in average borrowing costs from 2009 to 2016.  Although on the face of it, this shock does not seem 
too large, as discussed in Beltran and others (2017), it is applied to the average interest rate on the entire 
existing debt, not just on new debt.  Given that the average interest rate for EME firms is about 
4-3/4 percent, a 1 percentage point rise increases the interest expense by about a fifth.   
11 The calibration of the shocks is the same as in Beltran and others (2017).  A 20 percent earnings shock 
corresponds to about half of the decline in EME corporate earnings experienced after the global financial 
crisis.  It is difficult to say how much emerging market currencies might depreciate under stress, but 
20 percent currency depreciation seems well within the plausible range.  While the calibration of the shocks 
is the same as the above-mentioned study, the effects have been updated to reflect a larger sample of firms 
that is now available.  Qualitatively, the results and conclusions do not change from this update.   
12 In computing the new debt-at-risk after exchange rate shocks, we need the share of debt that is foreign 
currency-denominated, which is taken from Ayala, Nedelijkovic, and Saborowski (2015).

that U.S. monetary policy normalization has been and should continue to be gradual, as 

long as the U.S. economy evolves roughly as expected.   

Since the start of normalization in December 2015, the federal funds rate has risen 

to about 1-1/4 percent from its effective lower bound (slide 10).  The median projections 

of Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants (the blue dots) have it rising to 

2.9 percent by the end of 2020, fairly close to what is regarded by the median participant 

as its long-run value and significantly below its average value in the years prior to the 

GFC.  As reflected in the FOMC’s recent communications, the shrinkage of the Fed’s 

balance sheet is also expected to proceed quite gradually, with slowly phased-in increases 

in caps on the monthly reductions in the Federal Reserve’s security holdings.   

The expectation of gradual policy normalization should reduce the likelihood of 

outsized movements in interest rates.  Indeed, even if we add, say, a 50 basis point term 

premium to the expected long-run federal funds rate, this value would still leave long-

term U.S. interest rates (shown in slide 11) well below their pre-GFC averages.  As long 

as global financial conditions normalize in an orderly fashion, EMEs should have 

sufficient time to adjust.  And, as we saw earlier, interest rate changes of this magnitude 

should not lead to generalized corporate distress in EMEs, although undoubtedly some 

corporates are more exposed and could experience difficulties.   

Market Response 

All that said, market movements can be noisy, which brings me to what I believe 

is the most uncertain element--the potentially volatile behavior of markets even in an 

environment of relatively contained EME vulnerabilities and of gradual and clearly 

communicated advanced-economy monetary policies.   


 - 10 - 

So far, markets have behaved in a manner consistent with a relatively benign 

scenario for EMEs:  Risk sentiment is holding up, credit spreads in emerging markets 

have been declining, equities are up, long-term yields have hardly budged, and the dollar 

has been declining.  Markets, however, can turn on a dime, and reactions can be outsized.  

This concern may be especially relevant at present, given the low level of volatility and 

elevated asset prices in global markets, which may increase the likelihood and severity of 

an adjustment.   

Most of the time bouts of market turbulence lead to relatively quick corrections 

that leave markets more resilient without substantially depressing global growth.  The 

taper tantrum of 2013 that I mentioned earlier is a good example.  Ultimately, the policy 

adjustments made by some of the most affected economies, along with the more realistic 

appraisal of risks by global investors, likely left the global economy in a somewhat better 

position than before the episode.  That said, however, market tantrums pose complex 

economic and financial challenges, and such episodes carry a significant risk of 

snowballing into something bigger that more substantially threatens the economic 

expansion.   

Conclusion 

To conclude, I have suggested that the most likely outcome is that the challenges 

posed to EMEs by the normalization of global financial conditions will be manageable.13 

So far, capital flows have been moving in line with market fundamentals.  Although, 

EME vulnerabilities have been rising, they are still well below the levels of the crisis-

                                                 
13 The IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report, released October 11, (IMF, 2017), also 
concludes that EMEs should be able to handle any reduction in flows from global monetary policy 
normalization “in a relatively smooth manner, given their enhanced resilience and stronger growth 
outlook.”

prone years of the 1980s and 1990s.  Global monetary conditions are expected to 

normalize only gradually, as the Federal Reserve and other advanced-economy central 

banks continue to stress clear communication and transparency.  And the reaction of 

EME financial markets so far has been benign.  But significant risks of more adverse 

scenarios remain.  The corporate debt situation in EMEs has been worsening, particularly 

in China, and market reactions to even small surprises can be unpredictable and outsized.   

Even with these risks, however, the best thing the Federal Reserve can do--not 

just for the United States, but for the global economy at large--is to keep our house in 

order through the continued pursuit of our dual mandate.  Finally, it bears remembering 

that Fed policy normalization is occurring not in isolation, but in the context of a solid 

U.S. economic recovery, which should benefit all economies around the world.
