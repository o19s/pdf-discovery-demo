It is good to be here in Cincinnati.  I want to thank my colleague, Loretta Mester, 

for inviting me to participate today, and it is a pleasure to participate in the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Cleveland’s Policy Summit.1 

Today’s session is part of a series called Fed Listens.  The Federal Reserve is 

reaching out to communities around the country to hear how Americans are experiencing 

the economy day to day and to make sure we are carrying out the monetary policy goals 

assigned to us by the Congress in the most effective way we can.2   

The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve to use monetary policy to achieve 

maximum employment and price stability.  These two goals are what we refer to as our 

dual mandate.  By price stability, we mean moderate and stable inflation.  The Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC)—the group at the Fed responsible for determining 

monetary policy—has announced that our goal is to keep inflation around 2 percent over 

time.  The maximum-employment part of our dual mandate means that the Congress has 

directed us to achieve the highest level of employment that is consistent with 

price stability. 

The Outlook 

Earlier this week, President Mester and I participated in the meeting of the 

FOMC, where we had the opportunity to share our views on the economy and policy.

My own assessment is that the most likely path for the economy remains solid.  The latest 

data suggest that consumer spending is robust, and consumer confidence is high.  

Although the pace of payroll gains has moderated recently, unemployment is at a 50-year 

low, wages are growing, participation in the labor force has expanded, and 

unemployment insurance claims are at cycle lows.  Despite recent volatility, financial 

conditions overall remain supportive. 

Recent weeks, however, have seen important downside risks.  Crosscurrents from 

policy uncertainty have risen since early May, crimping business investment plans, 

raising concerns in some financial market segments, and weighing on global growth 

prospects.  Foreign authorities are seeking additional policy space to address growth and 

inflation shortfalls.  In addition, recent indicators of inflation and inflation expectations 

have been disappointing, making it all the more important to sustain the economy’s 

momentum.   

The downside risks, if they materialize, could weigh on economic activity.  Basic 

principles of risk management in a low neutral rate environment with compressed 

conventional policy space would argue for softening the expected path of policy when 

risks shift to the downside.3   

Our Review 

With recent indicators suggesting the expansion is continuing at a solid pace and 

unemployment at a 50-year low, inflation has not yet moved to our goal on a sustained 

                                                 
3 One reason for caution is the risk of building financial market imbalances, such as currently elevated 
levels of risky corporate debt.  In my view, it is better to address such financial imbalances by activation of 
our countercyclical capital buffer, rigorous use of stress tests, and beefed-up monitoring of leveraged 
lending than by monetary policy.

basis.  In many ways, that can be viewed as an opportunity, with the sustained expansion 

providing critical job opportunities to a broader set of applicants.  In parallel, it is also 

vital that a central bank meets its inflation target on a sustained basis, which will provide 

more capacity to buffer the economy if it encounters headwinds. 

We are undertaking our review to ensure we are well positioned to meet our goals 

for many years to come, especially in light of the way the economy is changing, which I 

have been referring to as the “new normal.”4  There are a few key features of that new 

normal.  First, interest rates have stayed very low in recent years in the United States and 

in many other advanced economies, and it seems likely that equilibrium interest rates will 

remain low in the future.  Low interest rates present a challenge for traditional monetary 

policy in recessions.  In the past, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates 4 to 5 

percentage points in order to support household spending and business investment.  

However, when equilibrium interest rates are low, we have less room to cut interest rates 

and less room to buffer the economy using our conventional tool.   

Another big change in the economy is that inflation does not move as much with 

economic activity and employment as it has in the past, which is what economists mean 

when they say the Phillips curve is very flat.  A flat Phillips curve has important 

advantages:  The labor market can strengthen a lot and pull many workers who may have 

been sidelined back into productive employment without an acceleration in inflation, 

unlike what we saw in the 1960s and 1970s.

On the other hand, today’s low sensitivity of inflation to slack, along with the 

limited ability to cut interest rates in a recession, means it can be more difficult to achieve 

our 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis.  The limited ability to cut interest 

rates could provide less ability to buffer the economy in a downturn, while the very flat 

Phillips curve could make it harder to boost inflation during an expansion.  And that 

could further compress policy space in a negative spiral.   

As we have seen in other countries, if inflation consistently falls short of the 

central bank’s objective, consumers, workers, and businesses start to expect lower 

inflation to continue.  Expectations of low inflation can create a self-fulfilling dynamic 

with actual inflation, making it even more difficult for the central bank to boost inflation.  

And because inflation is reflected in nominal interest rates, that, in turn, can reduce the 

amount of policy space the central bank has available to prevent the economy from 

slipping into recession.  In fact, in recent years, central banks around the world have had 

to use a larger variety of policy tools than they have traditionally used to support the 

recovery.   

Some Issues to Explore 

Given the new normal of low equilibrium interest rates and low sensitivity of 

inflation to slack, it is prudent to assess how well various approaches worked both here 

and around the world, with a view to identifying the best ways to promote the goals the 

Congress assigned to us.  Earlier this month, we held a conference in Chicago where we 

heard from experts as well as community organizations, small businesses, labor 

organizations, and retirees.  We are looking at our tools and strategies, assessing not just

the various approaches that were undertaken, but also approaches that have been 

proposed but not tried.   

One of the ideas discussed in Chicago is that the Federal Reserve should 

explicitly promise to “make up” for misses on inflation during a downturn.  The Federal 

Reserve could hold interest rates lower after a recession is over, perhaps by promising not 

to raise interest rates until inflation or the unemployment rate have reached particular 

levels.5  A related idea discussed in Chicago is average inflation targeting, meaning the 

Federal Reserve would aim to achieve its inflation objective, on average, over a longer 

period of time—perhaps over the business cycle.6  This approach could also have aspects 

of a makeup policy, depending on how it is designed.  While such approaches sound 

quite appealing on their face, they have not yet been implemented in practice.  There is 

some skepticism that a central bank would in fact prove able to support above-target 

inflation over a sustained period without becoming concerned that inflation might 

accelerate, and inflation expectations might rise too high.  

At the Chicago conference, we also heard how difficult it can be to estimate with 

any precision the “maximum employment” leg of our dual mandate.7  There is no fixed 

destination point for maximum employment—no single number where we can be sure we

are “there.”  Maximum employment is something that we must learn about by seeing how 

the job market is operating.  That is very different from the longer-run level of inflation, 

which central banks are presumed able to determine over time.      

At our conference in Chicago, we also asked the panelists about our 

communications with the public, and the responses were humbling.  The Federal Reserve 

communicates with the public about monetary policy through a variety of channels.  At 

each of our policy-setting meetings, the FOMC issues a statement, and Chair Jerome 

Powell holds a press conference.  Three weeks after the meeting, the minutes of the 

meeting are published.  Twice a year, the Federal Reserve submits a Monetary Policy 

Report to the Congress.   

We heard in Chicago that most members of the public care a lot about the job 

market and the cost of credit, but they are not aware of our communications about 

monetary policy.8  Of course, the media plays an important role in communicating our 

monetary policy actions and how they affect the economy.  And the Congress, which 

plays an important role in overseeing the Fed, is a key audience as well.  Nonetheless, 

considering how we can provide greater visibility to the public about what we do will be 

one of the issues we will be considering as our policy review continues.       

Listening 

Now, how does today’s event fit into all of this?  Since I arrived at the Fed, I have 

derived tremendous benefit from visiting communities all over the country to hear from

them how they are experiencing the economy.  Today President Mester and I want to hear 

from you.  How is your community experiencing today’s economy?  Is everyone who 

wants a job able to get one?  Can they get the necessary training?  Are businesses finding 

it relatively easy to hire the workers they need?  How does price inflation and wage 

growth affect you?  What about the availability and cost of credit—whether to start or 

expand a small business, buy a car to get to work, or invest in owning a home or getting a 

degree?  And are there ways we can better communicate with you?  I look forward to 

hearing your views on these and other questions.
