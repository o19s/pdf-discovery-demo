The financial crisis and its aftermath prompted an almost immediate call for 

change in financial regulation.  Beyond the basic reaction that prudential regulation 

needed to be stronger and less subject to arbitrage, considerable support grew for the 

formerly minority view that regulation also needed to be firmly grounded in a 

macroprudential perspective explicitly directed at the stability of the financial system as a 

whole, not just at each regulated firm individually.  The crisis also prompted increased 

attention to the relationship between monetary policy and financial stability.  Here the 

lines of debate seem more sharply drawn than in the area of financial regulation.  While 

few today would take the pre-crisis view common among central bankers that financial 

stability should not be an explicit concern of monetary policy, there is considerable 

disagreement over--among other things--the weight that financial stability concerns 

should carry compared with traditional monetary policy goals of price stability and 

maximum employment. 

This morning I will offer some comments on this ongoing debate.  In part, these 

remarks will give my perspective on some of the familiar points of contention, such as 

the relative priority and role of nonmonetary, compared with monetary, policy 

instruments in responding to risks to financial stability.  I also want to suggest that the 

cumulative effect over the past few decades of changes in financial technology, financial 

regulation, monetary policy itself, and perhaps the real economy have significantly 

altered the ways in which monetary instruments transmit through to the real economy.  

These changes may argue for refinement of monetary policy tools.  They may also 

indicate the need for regulatory measures that are neither time varying nor limited to

prudentially regulated firms, so as to provide a more stable financial foundation within 

which monetary policy will operate.   

The Role of Monetary Policy in Restoring Financial Stability 

The Federal Reserve, as we have been reminded by many accounts on the 

occasion of its centennial, was created largely in response to what we would now call 

financial stability concerns, as specifically revealed by the Panic of 1907.  When 

confronted with an even deeper financial panic a hundred years later, the Federal Reserve 

deployed its full range of policy tools-- monetary policy, lender of last resort, and 

supervision--in an effort to stabilize the U.S. financial system.  The Federal Reserve cut 

the federal funds rate to nearly zero by the end of 2008.  It developed an innovative set of 

programs to provide liquidity to financial institutions and to restore confidence in the 

markets.  These tools provided liquidity not only to commercial banks, but also to other 

financial institutions such as investment banks and money market funds, as well as to key 

financial markets such as those for commercial paper and asset-backed securities.1  This 

provision of liquidity was instrumental in helping restore market confidence.  Similarly, 

the development of the first supervisory stress test in 2009 helped to stabilize and restore 

confidence in the financial system as a whole by helping to ensure that the 19 largest 

bank holding companies were sufficiently capitalized so that they could continue serving 

as viable financial intermediaries.  

                                                 
1 Liquidity tools employed by the Federal Reserve that were closely tied to the central bank’s traditional 
role as lender of last resort involved the provision of short-term liquidity to depository and other financial 
institutions and included the traditional discount window; the Term Auction Facility, or TAF; the Primary 
Dealer Credit Facility, or PDCF; and the Term Securities Lending Facility, or TSLF.  A second set of tools 
involved the provision of liquidity directly to borrowers and investors in those credit markets key to 
households and businesses where the expanding crisis threatened to materially impede the availability of 
financing.  The tools that fall into that category are the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market 
Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, or AMLF; the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, or CPFF; the Money 
Market Investor Funding Facility, or MIFF; and the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF.

The combination of these tools was effective in restoring financial stability.  The 

Great Recession that followed the crisis posed a new set of challenges.  Given the 

constraint imposed by the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate, the Federal 

Reserve took unconventional measures to provide additional monetary accommodation 

during the recession and the subsequent protracted recovery.  These alternative policy 

tools included large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed 

securities for the Federal Reserve’s portfolio and enhanced communication about its 

anticipated future policy, or “forward guidance,” regarding the likely path of the federal 

funds rate. 

Large-scale asset purchases provided additional monetary accommodation by 

putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates through a portfolio-balance 

channel.  First used in November 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

subsequently initiated a series of purchase programs during the next several years and, in 

September 2012, implemented an open-ended program that would continue until there 

was a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.  With evidence 

accumulating that the labor market is improving materially, the Committee has begun to 

scale back the rate of these purchases. 

The Committee’s forward guidance is also intended to put downward pressure on 

longer-term interest rates by influencing market expectations about the future path of 

short-term rates.  Initially, the Committee relied on date-based descriptions of the likely 

path of interest rate policy.  But in December 2012 the Committee shifted to quantitative, 

state-contingent guidance to provide greater clarity about the likely course of the federal 

funds rate under different paths for the economy.  At that time, the Committee indicated 


 - 4 - 

that no increase in the federal funds rate target should be anticipated so long as 

unemployment remained above 6½ percent and inflation was projected to be no more 

than 2½ percent one-to-two years ahead.   

These unconventional tools appear to have been effective in helping promote the 

economic recovery.  In particular, research largely supports the conclusion that changes 

in guidance influenced interest rate expectations, that asset purchases pushed down 

longer-term interest rates and boosted asset prices, and that these improvements in 

financial conditions contributed to the economic recovery in recent years.2  The 

unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent at its 2009 peak to 6.6 percent today, 

although debate continues over whether significantly lower labor force participation rates 

and other labor market indicators should be read to indicate somewhat less progress than 

the unemployment rate alone would suggest.  But, while the recovery has been 

frustratingly slow and remains incomplete, there has been real progress, despite the fact 

that in the past couple of years a restrictive fiscal policy has been working at cross-

purposes to monetary policy, and that balance sheet repair and financial strains in Europe 

have made it more difficult for the economy to muster much self-sustaining momentum.

Monetary Policy and Risks to Financial Stability 

I hardly need remind this audience that the monetary policy pursued by the 

Federal Reserve in the past five years has occasioned considerable debate and 

controversy.  Much of the debate revolves around the degree of efficacy of the 

unconventional instruments, particularly large-scale asset purchases, and particularly 

whether there might be diminishing returns to these purchases in some circumstances.  I 

am certain that analysis of these issues will continue not only in the near term, but also in 

academic circles for years to come. 

A good bit of criticism has focused on the large expansion of the balance sheet 

and the sizable amount of excess reserves in the banking system.  One oft-stated worry is 

that when it is time to normalize policy, we will be unable to withdraw reserves as 

quickly as needed to prevent an unwanted rise in inflation.  Under the operating 

procedures used prior to the crisis, the presence of large quantities of excess reserves 

could well have impeded the FOMC’s ability to raise short-term interest rates.  But we 

have a variety of tools to neutralize the effects of our balance sheet without selling assets.  

For example, we now pay interest on reserves; raising that rate would put upward 

pressure on short-term rates.  In addition, we can drain reserves by employing fixed-rate 

overnight reverse repurchase agreements, term deposits, and term repurchase agreements.  

We will continue to develop and, as appropriate, test these tools to allow normalization of 

the balance sheet without unwanted inflationary consequences. 

The area of concern about recent monetary policy that I want to address at greater 

length relates to financial stability.  The worry is that the actual extended period of low 

interest rates, along with expectations fostered by forward guidance of continued low 


 - 6 - 

rates, may be incentivizing financial market actors to take on additional risks to boost 

margins, thereby contributing to unsustainable increases in asset prices and a consequent 

buildup of systemic vulnerabilities.  Indeed, in the years preceding the crisis, a few 

prescient observers swam against the tide of conventional wisdom to argue that a 

sustained period of low rates was inducing investors to “reach for yield” and thereby 

endangering the financial system.3 

The incentive to reach for yield can be a real and significant concern in some 

circumstances.  A low rate environment tends to squeeze the profitability of financial 

intermediaries of many types as they reinvest in assets with lower yields.4  Because these 

institutions can be driven by a variety of agency and accounting concerns to target high 

returns or place undue weight on the short-term performance of their portfolios, the 

pressure to maintain current yield can create incentives for these firms to take on 

excessive risk.5  This risk can manifest itself as excessive leverage, or greater credit or 

duration risk in portfolio choices, with the potential for large losses under adverse 

conditions.  In addition, to the extent that investors crowd into similar asset classes, low 

rates can potentially inflate a speculative bubble, the ultimate unwinding of which could 

have negative consequences for economic activity. 

                                                 
3 One of the most notable such expositions was provided in 2005 at the Jackson Hole symposium by 
Raghuram Rajan, a distinguished academic economist who has since become Governor of the Reserve 
Bank of India (see Raghuram G. Rajan (2005), “Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier?” 
paper presented at “The Greenspan Era:  Lessons for the Future,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal 
Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 25-27, 
www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2005/pdf/Rajan2005.pdf). 
4 Low interest rates depress net interest margins for banks as the value of their deposit franchise falls, and 
they boost the present value of liabilities for insurers and pension funds while reducing their prospective 
returns from fixed-income investments. 
5 For instance, inflows into mutual funds, a key determinant of an investment manager’s compensation, are 
strongly positively correlated with recent fund performance.  For example, see Judith Chevalier and Glenn 
Ellison (1997), “Risk Taking by Mutual Funds as a Response to Incentives,” Journal of Political Economy, 
vol. 105 (6), pp. 1167-200.   


 - 7 - 

Here, then, is the potential quandary:  The very accommodative monetary policy 

that contributed to the restoration of financial stability could, if maintained long enough 

in the face of slow recovery in the real economy, eventually sow the seeds of renewed 

financial instability.  Yet removal of accommodation could choke off the recovery just as 

it seems poised to gain at least a bit more momentum.  Such a situation requires 

assessment of the extent of this risk and, of particular importance to my topic today, the 

appropriate role of monetary policy in containing it. 

Protecting Financial Stability 

In presenting the mix of salient considerations in reacting to possible financial 

stability risks arising from extended periods of accommodative monetary policy, I should 

state at the outset something that will not likely come as a surprise to any of you.  My 

observation has been that people’s views on these risks tend to be at least generally 

correlated with their views on the effectiveness of monetary policy over the past few 

years and on the size of the output gap that remains today.  Having said that, I have also 

observed that most people engaging in these discussions--whether in policy circles, 

commentary, or academic work--would agree on the basic policy instruments available 

for systemic risk containment, even as they would disagree on the extent of the threat and 

the relative utility of those instruments.  So let me now present some of my own thoughts 

on both the specifics of the present situation and on some of the ongoing policy issues 

raised by these discussions. 

As a preliminary matter, it is important to note that incorporating financial 

stability considerations into monetary policy decisions need not imply the creation of an 

additional mandate for monetary policy.  The potentially huge effect on price stability 


 - 8 - 

and employment associated with bouts of serious financial instability gives ample 

justification.  Of course, this preliminary observation underscores the fact that the 

identification of systemic risks, especially those based on the putative emergence of asset 

bubbles, is not a straightforward exercise.  The eventual impact of the bursting of the pre-

crisis housing bubble on financial stability went famously underdiagnosed by 

policymakers and many private analysts.  But there would be considerable economic 

downside in reacting with policy measures each time a case could be made that a bubble 

was developing.  That is, there is ample opportunity for both Type 1 and Type 2 errors.  

As the metrics for assessing systemic risks continue to improve, this problem may be 

alleviated, but I suspect it will never be eliminated. 

We are paying close attention to the macroprudential risks posed by the low 

interest rate environment, particularly given the possibility that interest rates may remain 

historically low for some time even after the FOMC begins to increase its target for the 

federal funds rate.  The Federal Reserve has, as a result of a number of organizational 

changes made since the crisis, a more focused structure for monitoring potential risks to 

financial stability and using the information we glean from this monitoring to shape our 

supervisory and regulatory actions.  One prominent change has been the reorientation of 

our supervision of large bank holding companies through the creation of the Large 

Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, or LISCC, to specifically incorporate 

systemic risk considerations.  Another has been the creation of the Office of Financial 

Stability Policy and Research, which is charged with monitoring financial risks, 

analyzing the implications for financial stability, and identifying macroprudential policies 

for mitigating detected risks.   


 - 9 - 

At present, our monitoring does find some evidence of increased duration and 

credit risk, but the increases appear relatively moderate to date--particularly at the largest 

banks and life insurers.  Moreover, valuations for broad categories of assets such as real 

estate and corporate equities remain within historical norms, suggesting that valuation 

pressures, if present, are confined to narrower segments of assets.  For example, 

valuations do appear stretched for farmland, although recent data are suggesting some 

slowing, and for the equity prices of some small technology firms. 

Still, there are areas where investors appear to have been very sanguine regarding 

certain types of exposure and modest in their demands for compensation to assume such 

risk.  High-yield corporate bond and leveraged loan funds, for instance, have seen strong 

inflows, reflecting greater investor appetite for risky corporate credits, while underwriting 

standards have deteriorated, raising the possibility of large losses going forward.   

In these circumstances, it has to date seemed appropriate to rely on supervisory 

responses.  For example, in the face of substantial growth in the volume of leveraged 

lending and the deterioration in underwriting standards, the Federal Reserve, the Office 

of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued 

updated guidance on leverage lending in March 2013.6  This guidance outlined principles 

related to safe and sound leveraged lending activities, including the expectation that 

banks and thrifts originate leveraged loans using prudent underwriting standards 

regardless of their intent to hold or distribute them.     

In addition, the Federal Reserve, alongside other regulators, has been working 

with the firms we supervise to increase their resilience to possible interest rate shocks.

 - 10 - 

For instance, in both the 2013 and 2014 stress test and capital planning exercises, we 

incorporated various combinations of interest rate shocks in the adverse scenarios.  

Supervisors have also been working to estimate the implications of a wider variety of 

interest rate shocks.  Our analysis to this point (undertaken outside of our annual stress 

test program) suggests that banking firms are capitalized to withstand the losses in asset 

valuations that would arise from large spikes in rates, which, moreover, would see an 

offset from the increase in the value of bank deposit franchises.  This finding is consistent 

with the lack of widespread stress during the period of May through June 2013 when 

interest rates increased considerably.7  The next set of stress-test results, which we will 

release next month, will provide further insight on this point, both to regulators and to 

markets. 

While ad hoc supervisory action aimed at specific lending or risks is surely a 

useful tool, it has its limitations.  First, it is a bit too soon to judge precisely how effective 

these supervisory actions – such as last year’s leveraged lending guidance – have been.  

Second, even if they prove effective in containing discrete excesses, it is not clear that the 

somewhat deliberate supervisory process would be adequate to deal with a more 

pervasive reach for yield affecting many areas of credit extension.  Third, and perhaps 

most important, the extent to which supervisory practice can either lean against the wind 

or increase the overall resiliency of the financial system is limited by the fact that it 

applies only to prudentially regulated firms.  This circumstance creates an incentive for 

intermediation activities to migrate outside of the regulated sector.   

                                                 
7 The FSOC staff with the regulatory agencies also have been assessing whether other financial institutions, 
such as insurance companies and pension funds, may be susceptible to a large spike in interest rates. 


 - 11 - 

Should this shift occur in significant ways, the financial system could ultimately 

be exposed again to the very risks against which much post-crisis regulatory reform has 

been directed.  To be sure, it is not a trivial task for unregulated financial-sector 

participants to move into activities in which regulated institutions have traditionally 

operated.  But if the potential gains were high enough, unregulated actors could have 

sufficient incentive to do so.  Indeed, it must be recognized that regular recourse to 

supervisory measures in response to nascent financial stability concerns would likely be 

perceived as increasing the payoff from this form of regulatory arbitrage. 

The limitations of supervision as a tool for managing the risks to financial 

stability that could arise from protracted periods of low interest rates have intensified 

interest in time-varying macroprudential policies -- that is, measures that can be 

calibrated to changing economic or financial conditions.  A frequently cited example is 

increased loan-to-value requirements for certain types of lending such as residential or 

commercial mortgages.  The appeal of such requirements is that they could, at least in 

principle, be adopted reasonably quickly as risks increased, implemented in a 

straightforward way, and applied to all market actors engaged in the covered activities, 

not just prudentially regulated firms.   

Having just recently addressed at some length the promise and limitations of such 

time-varying macroprudential tools, I will not repeat those views at length today.8  I can 

summarize by saying that, in practice, such policies face a number of challenges, 

including questions about the reliability of measures to guide policy actions, which 

officials should make macroprudential decisions, the speed with which policies might

realistically be implemented and take effect, and the appropriate calibration of policies 

that will be effective in damping excesses while not unnecessarily reducing well-

underwritten credit flows. 9  And, as with supervisory policies, there is reason to doubt 

how effective they would be in circumstances where credit growth had been excessive 

across wide parts of the economy.   

As I have said previously, however, given that procyclicality is an important 

contributor to systemic risk, there is good reason to continue work on developing time-

varying policies.  I would devote particular attention to policies that can act as the rough 

equivalent of an increase in interest rates for particular sources of funding.  Such policies 

would be more responsive to problems that were building quickly because of certain 

kinds of credit, without regard to whether they were being deployed in one or many 

sectors of the economy.  In that respect, such policies should be more effective (and 

perhaps less controversial) in slowing the buildup of excess credit than a measure 

directed squarely at one sector, which might be quickly met by the redirection of a reach 

for yield to other asset classes.   

 One example is the countercyclical capital buffer in Basel III, which provides for 

an increase in the risk-weighted capital requirements of prudentially regulated banking 

organizations of up to 2-1/2 percentage points when “credit growth is excessive and is 

                                                 
9 Note that this issue of shared or complementary authorities, grounded in constitutional considerations 
such as democratic accountability and avoiding too much concentration of power in any one part of 
government, is already a factor.  While the Financial Stability Oversight Council was created in part to 
allow for coordination of the authorities of its constituent agencies, it cannot assure coordination among 
independent entities, most of which have a number of independent members.  Even within the Federal 
Reserve, there is not a unity of relevant authority, in that regulatory and supervisory powers are lodged only 
in the Board of Governors, whereas monetary policymaking rests with the entire FOMC.

leading to the buildup of system-wide risk.”10   Because stricter capital requirements lead 

to higher levels of bank equity--which is typically more expensive than debt--they would 

likely result in higher funding costs for the bank-intermediated credit utilized by other 

market participants.  In this regard, time-varying macroprudential policies can be thought 

of as addressing cyclical systemic risks via interest rates in a manner somewhat akin to a 

tightening of monetary policy, which by raising benchmark interest rates affects a similar 

increase in funding costs.   

Clearly, time-varying macroprudential policies could not be viewed as a substitute 

for monetary policy.  Like ad hoc supervisory policies, they would influence a narrower 

set of transactions and, as such, would not “get in all the cracks” of the financial system, 

to use a phrase coined by my colleague Jeremy Stein.  But, to shift metaphors, they could 

potentially provide something of a speed bump, while not producing the much broader 

effect on the economy that a federal funds rate increase would.  Moreover, time-varying 

macroprudential policies may also give monetary policymakers more of an opportunity to 

assess whether the asset inflation is generalized and sustained enough to warrant a change 

in monetary policy.11   

Although the three federal banking agencies included a countercyclical capital 

provision in the capital regulation to implement Basel III adopted last summer, the 

provision will not take effect in the United States until 2016.  However, when the 

countercyclical capital buffer provision of Basel III does come into effect in the United

Resilient Banks and Banking Systems,” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, June), p. 
57. 
11 It is worth noting that time-varying macroprudential policies like the countercyclical capital buffer also 
bolster resilience in the financial sector by increasing bank and dealer loss absorbency.  Countercyclical or 
even through-the-cycle minimum haircuts on SFTs bolster resilience by reducing the amount that haircuts 
might jump when conditions weaken.

States, we will have the benefit of experience for this tool from other countries.  Over the 

past year, the Norges Bank, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, and the Financial Policy 

Committee at the Bank of England have all finalized general statements on how this 

policy lever will operate in their jurisdictions, with implementation in each case 

proceeding in advance of when the policy will come into effect under Basel III.12  

Moreover, in December, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance accepted the advice of the 

Norges Bank to activate a countercyclical capital buffer in the face of rising financial 

imbalances.  The level of the buffer will be set at 1 percent of risk-weighted assets, 

starting July 1, 2015.13 

 The foregoing discussion has considered the ways in which existing supervisory 

authority and new forms of macroprudential authority may allow monetary policymakers 

to avoid, or at least defer, raising interest rates to contain growing systemic risks under 

circumstances in which policy is falling well short of achieving one or both elements of 

the dual mandate.  However, as has doubtless been apparent, I believe these alternative 

policy instruments have real limitations.  As I noted earlier, I do not think that at present 

we are confronted with a situation that would warrant a change in the monetary policy we 

have been pursuing.  But for that very reason, now is a good time to consider these issues 

more actively.  One useful step would be development of a framework that would allow 

us to make a more analytic, less instinctual judgment on the potential tradeoffs between

enhanced financial stability and reduced economic activity.  This will be an intellectually 

challenging exercise, but in itself does not entail any changes in policy.   

Monetary Policy and Financial System 

I have to this point described the possible need to balance longer-term financial 

stability and shorter-term economic growth considerations in the implicit context of a 

specific point in time, with the decision on use of supervisory, macroprudential, or 

monetary policy tools dependent on the level and nature of the potential systemic risk, the 

likely efficacy of each tool in containing that risk, and the expected side effects of each 

tool on growth.   But in thinking about the relationship between monetary policy and 

financial stability, it is also worth taking a view less focused on decisions at a specific 

point in time.   

Changes in financial technology, regulation, and perhaps the real economy over 

the past few decades have profoundly affected the channels by which credit is created in 

the economy, and thus the potential for financial instability.  The progressive integration 

of traditional lending and capital markets activities has created a fundamentally different 

financial system from that which existed from the mid-1930s through the mid-1970s, 

during which strict activities restrictions, limitations on competition, and deposit interest 

rate caps had shaped a banking system that was very stable and reasonably profitable, but 

not particularly innovative in meetings the needs of either savers or borrowers.  The 

extensive deregulation of banking in the 30 years preceding the crisis, while 

understandable as a response to the threat posed by capital markets and unregulated 

financial firms to the franchise of regulated firms, left the financial system without a 

basic framework to contain the risks posed in the new environment. 


 - 16 - 

The explosive growth of short-term wholesale funding in the years preceding the 

crisis is the exemplary case of how the regulatory system has not kept pace with the 

integration of traditional lending and capital market activities.  The amount of credit 

created through those channels meant that aggregate credit growth in the economy 

relative to GDP was much higher than just a few decades earlier, a development that may 

itself be connected to a greater likelihood of financial crises.14  Moreover, this funding 

was peculiarly susceptible to runs that can prompt fire sales and the sudden withdrawal of 

credit from counterparties.   

These direct financial stability concerns have been my principal motivation in 

devoting so much attention to measures such as minimum margins on securities financing 

transactions, a version of which are currently under development internationally under 

the auspices of the Financial Stability Board.15  But these kinds of changes might also 

make the trade-off between systemic risk and near-term growth aims a bit easier, since a 

financial system with more ballast will be less prone to listing in response to 

accommodative monetary policies directed at the dual mandate goals of price stability 

and maximum employment.  Were such a regime of minimum margins in place, one 

could also see the potential for enhancing the effectiveness of monetary policy by adding 

a time-varying, countercyclical component.

Finally, it may also be worth considering some refinements to our monetary 

policy tools.  Central banks must always be cognizant of important changes that may 

result in different responses of households, firms, and financial markets to monetary 

policy actions.  There is little doubt that the conduct of monetary policy has become a 

good deal more complicated in recent years.  Some of these complications may diminish 

as economic and financial conditions normalize, but others may be more persistent.  

Central banks, in turn, may want to build on some recent experience, adapted for more 

normal times, in addressing the desire to contain systemic risk without removing 

monetary policy accommodation to advance one or both dual mandate goals.  

One example would be altering the composition of a central bank’s balance sheet 

so as to add a second policy instrument to changes in the targeted interest rate.  The 

central bank might under some conditions want to use a combination of the two 

instruments to respond to concurrent concerns about macroeconomic sluggishness and 

excessive maturity transformation by lowering the target (short-term) interest rate and 

simultaneously flattening the yield curve through swapping shorter duration assets for 

longer-term ones.  

Conclusion 

 In reviewing the relationship between financial stability considerations and 

monetary policy, I have suggested that monetary policy action cannot be taken off the 

table as a response to the build-up of broad and sustained systemic risk.  But I have also 

tried to suggest that the development of existing supervisory tools, the judicious use of 

macroprudential measures, the adoption of some structural measures affecting certain 

forms of financing, and perhaps some refinements of monetary policy tools can together

reduce the number of occasions on which a difficult tradeoff between financial stability 

considerations and near-term growth or price stability aims will need to be made.
