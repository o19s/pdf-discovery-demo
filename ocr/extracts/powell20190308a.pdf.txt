Monetary Policy:  Normalization and the Road Ahead 

Remarks by 

Jerome H. Powell 

Chair 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at 

2019 SIEPR Economic Summit 

Stanford Institute of Economic Policy Research 
Stanford, California 

March 8, 2019 



Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today at the Stanford Institute for 

Economic Policy Research, a place dedicated to scholarship supporting policies to better 

peoples’ lives.  As today is International Women’s Day, I would like to preface my 

remarks by commending the American Economic Association for highlighting the 

diversity challenges of the economics profession and charting a way forward.  Diversity 

is also a priority at the Fed:  I want the Fed to be known within the economics profession 

as a great place for women, minorities, and others of diverse backgrounds to be  

respected, listened to, and happy. 

Just over 10 years ago, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC, or the 

Committee) lowered the federal funds rate close to zero, which we refer to as the 

effective lower bound, or ELB.  Unable to lower rates further, the Committee turned to 

two novel tools to promote the recovery.  The first was forward guidance, which is 

communication about the future path of interest rates.  The second was large-scale 

purchases of longer-term securities, which became known as quantitative easing, or QE.  

There is a range of views, but most studies have found that these tools provided 

significant support for the recovery.  From the outset, the Committee viewed them as 

extraordinary measures to be unwound, or “normalized,” when conditions ultimately 

warranted.   

Today I will explore some important features of normalization and then turn to 

what comes after.  In some ways, we are returning to the pre-crisis normal.  In other 

ways, things will be different.  The world has moved on in the last decade, and 

attempting to re-create the past would be neither practical nor wise.  As normalization 

moves into its later stages, my colleagues and I also believe that this is an important

moment to take stock of issues raised by the remarkable experiences of the past decade.  

We are therefore conducting a review of the Fed’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communications practices.  I will conclude with some thoughts on the review. 

Balance Sheet Normalization 

Between December 2008 and October 2014, the Federal Reserve purchased 

$3.7 trillion in longer-term Treasury and agency securities in order to support the 

economy both by easing dislocations in market functioning and by driving down longer-

term interest rates.  Consistent with the Committee’s long-stated intention, in October 

2017 we started the process of balance sheet normalization.  We began gradually 

reducing the reinvestment of payments received as assets matured or were prepaid, 

allowing our holdings to shrink.  The process of reducing the size of the portfolio is now 

well along. 

To frame the discussion of the final stages of normalization of the size of the 

balance sheet, it is useful to consider what the phrase “normal balance sheet” meant in the 

decades before the crisis.  During that period, the main monetary policy decision for the 

FOMC was choosing a target value for the federal funds rate.  Subject to that choice, the 

Fed allowed the demand for its liabilities to determine the size of the balance sheet.  This 

is a feature of “normal” that we are returning to:  After normalization, the size of the 

Fed’s balance sheet will once again be driven by the demand for our liabilities.   

To see what this means, consider figure 1, which shows the size of the Fed’s 

balance sheet through time, as measured by total liabilities.  The values are stated as a 

percentage of the dollar value of GDP, or gross domestic product.1  Liabilities began to 

                                                 
1 The balance sheet had been steady at around 5 percent of GDP since about 1980, as currency slowly grew 
as a share of GDP, but the increase was offset by a decline in reserves. 


 - 3 - 

grow sharply at the end of 2008 and continued to increase until the end of 2014.  Since 

that time, liabilities relative to GDP have fallen appreciably.  To understand these 

changes, it is useful to focus on a snapshot of the balance sheet at three points in time:  

before the crisis, when the balance sheet was at its largest, and a rough projection for the 

end of this year (table 1).   

In 2006, the dominant liability was currency held by the public, and the dominant 

asset was Treasury securities.  The Fed’s asset purchase programs increased the balance 

sheet from just below 6 percent to nearly 25 percent of GDP by the end of 2014.2  

Balance sheets must balance, of course, and the Fed issued reserves as payment for the 

assets purchased.  This action pushed reserves to nearly 15 percent of GDP.  

The Committee has long said that the size of the balance sheet will be considered 

normalized when the balance sheet is once again at the smallest level consistent with 

conducting monetary policy efficiently and effectively.  Just how large that will be is 

uncertain, because we do not yet have a clear sense of the normal level of demand for our 

liabilities.  Current estimates suggest, however, that something in the ballpark of the 

2019:Q4 projected values may be the new normal.  The normalized balance sheet may be 

smaller or larger than that estimate and will grow gradually over time as demand for 

currency rises with the economy.  In all plausible cases, the balance sheet will be 

considerably larger than before the crisis. 

To understand the differences between the new and old normal, consider the final 

column in the table, which shows the change, measured in percentage points of GDP, 

between 2006:Q4 and the 2019:Q4 projection in the table.  In this estimate, relative to 

                                                 
2 This size is similar to that of the balance sheet relative to GDP in the wake of the Great Depression. 


 - 4 - 

before the crisis, the balance sheet will have grown as a share of GDP by about 

10.6 percentage points.  Bank reserves account for the biggest part of the growth, or 

about 5.6 percent of GDP.  The crisis revealed that banks, especially the largest and most 

complex, faced much more liquidity risk than had previously been thought.  Because of 

both new liquidity regulations and improved management, banks now hold much higher 

levels of high-quality liquid assets than before the crisis.  Many banks choose to hold 

reserves as an important part of their strong liquidity positions.  

The rest of the increase in liabilities is accounted for by three other categories.  

First, public currency holdings will have grown by 2.4 percentage points as a share of 

GDP.  Second, the U.S. Treasury maintains an account at the Fed, which has been 

running 1.4 percentage points higher as a share of GDP.  And, third, other liabilities, 

which are mainly associated with the mechanics of the national and international 

financial system, will have grown by 1.1 percentage points.     

As was the case before the crisis, the FOMC’s chosen operating regime for 

controlling short-term interest rates also plays a role in determining the appropriate 

quantity of reserves.  In January, the Committee stated its intention to continue in our 

current regime in which our main policy rate, the federal funds rate or possibly some 

successor, is held within its target range by the interest rates we set on reserves and on the 

overnight reverse repo facility.3  In this system, active management of the supply of 

reserves is not required.  Thus, the supply of reserves must be “ample,” in the sense of 

being sufficient to satisfy reserve demands even in the face of volatility in factors 

                                                 
3 As noted in the minutes of the November 2018 FOMC meeting (see 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20181108.htm), participants discussed costs 
and benefits of various alternatives to the federal funds rate, such as the overnight bank funding rate, and 
recommended further study of the issue.   


 - 5 - 

affecting the reserve market.4  Put another way, the quantity of reserves will equal the 

typical reserve demands of depositories plus a buffer to allow for reserve market 

fluctuations.  

While the precise level of reserves that will prove ample is uncertain, standard 

projections, such as those in the table, suggest we could be near that level later this year.  

As we feel our way cautiously to this goal, we will move transparently and predictably in 

order to minimize needless market disruption and risks to our dual-mandate objectives.  

The Committee is now well along in our discussions of a plan to conclude balance sheet 

runoff later this year.  Once balance sheet runoff ends, we may, if appropriate, hold the 

size of the balance sheet constant for a time to allow reserves to very gradually decline to 

the desired level as other liabilities, such as currency, increase.  We expect to announce 

further details of this plan reasonably soon.   

There is no real precedent for the balance sheet normalization process, and we 

have adapted our approach along the way.  In these final phases, we will adjust the details 

of our normalization plans if economic and financial conditions warrant.  After decisions 

regarding the size of the balance sheet have been made, we will turn to remaining issues, 

such as the ultimate maturity composition of the portfolio.  The Committee has long 

stated that it intends to return to a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities.   

Forward Guidance and the Normalization of Policy Communication  

The Committee has also been normalizing communication about our policy after a 

decade of forward guidance.  Since December 2008, the FOMC’s postmeeting statement 

had contained ever-evolving forms of guidance about keeping the federal funds rate at the 

                                                 
4 Both supply and demand factors can show large fluctuations.

ELB or about the gradual pace at which that rate would return to more normal levels.  We 

removed the last elements of this crisis-era guidance in January.5  The federal funds rate 

is now within the broad range of estimates of the neutral rate--the interest rate that tends 

neither to stimulate nor to restrain the economy.  Committee participants generally agree 

that this policy stance is appropriate to promote our dual mandate of maximum 

employment and price stability.  Future adjustments will depend on what incoming data 

tell us about the baseline outlook and risks to that outlook. 

Policy communication will not simply revert to the ways of the early 2000s, 

however, for transparency advances have continued apace since then.  The most 

significant change from the standpoint of forward guidance is that, since January 2012, 

the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) has included federal 

funds rate projections reaching up to three years into the future--often referred to as the 

“dot plot.”  Returning to a world of little or no explicit forward guidance in the FOMC’s 

postmeeting statement presents a challenge, for the dot plot has, on occasion, been a 

source of confusion.  Until now, forward guidance in the statement has been a main tool 

for communicating committee intentions and minimizing that confusion.  

For example, in early 2014, the Committee’s intentions were at odds with a 

common misreading of the dots, and Chair Yellen explained, “[O]ne should not look to 

the dot plot, so to speak, as the primary way in which the Committee wants to or is 

speaking about policy to the public at large.  The FOMC statement is the device that the 

                                                 
5 Of course, “patience” as used in the January FOMC statement (see 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20190130a.htm) might be seen as 
forward guidance.  This type of guidance was used at times before the crisis and may play a role in the 
future.  It is not, however, the explicit guidance about the medium-term level or direction of rates that 
distinguished the crisis-era guidance. 


 - 7 - 

Committee as a policymaking group uses to express its opinions . . . about the likely path 

of rates.”6  If the Committee remains largely out of the business of explicit forward 

guidance, we will need to find other ways to address the collateral confusion that 

sometimes surrounds the dots.  

As readers of the FOMC minutes will know, at our last meeting in January there 

was an impromptu discussion among some participants of general concerns about the 

dots.  My own view is that, if properly understood, the dot plot can be a constructive 

element of comprehensive policy communication.  Let me follow my two predecessors as 

Chair in attempting to advance that proper understanding.   

Each participant’s dots reflect that participant’s view of the policy that would be 

appropriate in the scenario that he or she sees as most likely.  As someone who has filled 

out an SEP projection 27 times over the last seven years, I can say that there are times 

when I feel that something like the “most likely” scenario I write down is, indeed, 

reasonably likely to happen.  At other times, when uncertainty around the outlook is 

unusually high, I dutifully write down what I see as the appropriate funds rate path in the 

most likely scenario, but I do so aware that this projection may be easily misinterpreted, 

for what is “most likely” may not be particularly likely.  Very different scenarios may be 

similarly likely.  Further, at times downside risks may deserve significant weight in 

policy deliberations.  In short, as Chairman Bernanke explained, the SEP projections are 

merely “inputs” to policy that do not convey “the risks, the uncertainties, all the things 

that inform our collective judgment.”7

Effectively conveying our views about risks and their role in policy projections 

can be challenging at times, and we are always looking for ways to improve our 

communications.  I have asked the communications subcommittee of the FOMC to 

explore ways in which we can more effectively communicate about the role of the rate 

projections.  For now, let me leave you with a cautionary tale about focusing too much on 

dots.  Here is a picture composed of different colored dots (figure 2).  The meaning of it 

is not clear, although if you stare at it long enough you might see a pattern.  But let’s take 

a step back (figure 3).  As you can see, if you are too focused on a few dots, you may 

miss the larger picture. 

Delivering on the FOMC’s intention to ultimately normalize policy continues to 

be a major priority at the Fed.  Normalization is far along, and, considering the 

unprecedented nature of the exercise, it is proceeding smoothly.  I am confident that we 

can effectively manage the remaining stages. 

Beyond Normalization 

We live in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public institutions 

around the world.  At the Fed, we are committed to working hard to build and sustain the 

public’s trust.  The Fed has special responsibilities in this regard.  Our monetary policy 

independence allows us to serve the public without regard to short-term political 

considerations, which, as history has shown, is critical for sound monetary policymaking.  

But that precious grant of independence brings with it a special obligation to be open and 

transparent, welcoming scrutiny by the public and their elected representatives in 

Congress.  Only in this way can the Fed maintain its legitimacy in our democratic system. 

                                                 
provide some general information about the balance of risks, but this information is far less complete than 
the detail provided on the modal outlook. 


 - 9 - 

Among other initiatives, my colleagues and I on the FOMC are undertaking a 

year-long review of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communication practices.  The review will involve a series of “Fed Listens” events 

around the country.  These will include town-hall-style meetings and a conference where 

academic and nonacademic experts will share their views.  These events will inform staff 

work and FOMC discussions as we plan for the future.  While this is the first time the 

Fed has opened itself up in this way, many central banks around the world have 

conducted similar reviews, and our approach builds on their experiences. 

We believe that our existing framework for conducting monetary policy has 

generally served the public well, and the review may or may not produce major changes.  

Consistent with the experience of other central banks with these reviews, the process is 

more likely to produce evolution rather than revolution.  We seek no changes in law and 

we are not considering fundamental changes in the structure of the Fed, or in the 2 

percent inflation objective.  While there is a high bar for adopting fundamental change, it 

simply seems like good institutional practice to engage broadly with the public as part of 

a comprehensive approach to enhanced transparency and accountability. 

Without ruling out other topics, we have highlighted three questions that seem 

particularly important at present (figure 4):   

1.  Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its 

existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to 

reverse past misses of the inflation objective? 


 - 10 - 

2.  Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and 

maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be 

expanded? 

3.  How can the FOMC’s communication of its policy framework and 

implementation be improved? 

I would like to spend a few minutes discussing the first topic.  Because interest 

rates around the world have steadily declined for several decades, rates in normal times 

now tend to be much closer to zero than in the past (figure 5).8  Thus, when a recession 

comes, the Fed is likely to have less capacity to cut interest rates to stimulate the 

economy than in the past, suggesting that trips to the ELB may be more frequent.  The 

post-crisis period has seen many economies around the world stuck for an extended 

period at the ELB, with slow growth and inflation well below target.  Persistently weak 

inflation could lead inflation expectations to drift downward, which would imply still 

lower interest rates, leaving even less room for central banks to cut interest rates to 

support the economy during a downturn.  It is therefore very important for central banks 

to find more effective ways to battle the low-inflation syndrome that seems to accompany 

proximity to the ELB.  

In the late 1990s, motivated by the Japanese experience with deflation and 

sluggish economic performance, economists began developing the argument that a 

central bank might substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB spells by adopting a 

makeup strategy.9  The simplest version goes like this:  If a spell with interest rates near 

                                                 
8 For evidence on the secular decline in interest rates in the United States and abroad, see King and Low 
(2014); Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2017); Rachel and Smith (2017); and Brand, Bielecki, and 
Penalver (2018).   
9 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and references therein. 


 - 11 - 

the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of inflation relative to the central bank’s goal, once 

the ELB spell ends, the central bank would deliberately make up for the lost inflation by 

stimulating the economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target.  In 

standard macroeconomic models, if households and businesses are confident that this 

future inflationary stimulus will be coming, that prospect will promote anticipatory 

consumption and investment.  This can substantially reduce the economic costs of ELB 

spells.10  Researchers have suggested many variations on makeup strategies.11 For 

example, the central bank could target average inflation over time, implying that misses 

on either side of the target would be offset.   

By the time of the crisis, there was a well-established body of model-based 

research suggesting that some kind of makeup policy could be beneficial.12  In light of 

this research, one might ask why the Fed and other major central banks chose not to 

pursue such a policy.13  The answer lies in the uncertain distance between models and 

reality.  For makeup strategies to achieve their stabilizing benefits, households and 

businesses must be quite confident that the “makeup stimulus” is really coming.  This 

confidence is what prompts them to raise spending and investment in the midst of a 

downturn.  In models, confidence in the policy is merely an assumption.  In practice, 

                                                 
10 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for example, show that optimal policy at the ELB entails a 
commitment to reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions.  See also Wolman (2005) 
for a discussion of the effectiveness of price-level targeting at the ELB.  For a discussion of the relationship 
between price-level targeting and average-inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin (2005).  
11 The strategy in Reifschneider and Williams (2000), for instance, involves a central bank following a 
Taylor rule modified to make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes.  Kiley and 
Roberts (2017) study a strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during 
normal times to compensate for below-target inflation during ELB episodes.  See also Bernanke (2017) for 
a strategy in which low inflation is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB.  
12 See, for example, English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015); Hebden and López-Salido (2018); 
Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); and Mertens and Williams (2019).  
13 The Bank of Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation-overshooting 
commitment” (p. 1).  The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or 
duration of overshoot.   


 - 12 - 

when policymakers considered these policies in the wake of the crisis, they had major 

questions about whether a central bank’s promise of good times to come would have 

moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the public.  Part of the problem is that when 

the time comes to deliver the inflationary stimulus, that policy is likely to be unpopular--

what is known as the time consistency problem in economics.14   

Experience in the United States and around the world suggests that more frequent 

ELB episodes could prove quite costly in the future.  My FOMC colleagues and I believe 

that we have a responsibility to the American people to consider policies that might 

promote significantly better economic outcomes.  Makeup strategies are probably the 

most prominent idea and deserve serious attention.  They are largely untried, however, 

and we have reason to question how they would perform in practice.  Before they could 

be successfully implemented, there would have to be widespread societal understanding 

and acceptance--as I suggested, a high bar for any fundamental change.  In this review, 

we seek to start a discussion about makeup strategies and other policies that might 

broadly benefit the American people.   

Conclusion   

Tonight I have focused on policy normalization and our efforts to engage the 

public in what may come after.  Before concluding, I will say a few words on current 

conditions and the outlook.   

                                                 
14 Transcripts of FOMC discussions (see, for example, 2011 transcripts, available at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2011.htm) reveal that some policymakers 
were dubious about whether it would be appropriate or even feasible for a current FOMC to bind a future 
FOMC to a policy that it might find objectionable, which contributed to more general doubts over whether 
the policy would be credible. 


 - 13 - 

Right now, most measures of the health and strength of the labor market look as 

favorable as they have in many decades.  Inflation will probably run a bit below our 

objective for a time due to declines in energy prices, but those effects are likely to prove 

transitory.  Core inflation, which is often a reliable indicator of where inflation is headed 

over time, is quite close to 2 percent.  Despite this favorable picture, we have seen some 

cross-currents in recent months.  With nothing in the outlook demanding an immediate 

policy response and particularly given muted inflation pressures, the Committee has 

adopted a patient, wait-and-see approach to considering any alteration in the stance of 

policy. 

Considering monetary policy more broadly, we are inviting thorough public 

scrutiny and are hoping to foster conversation regarding how the Fed can best exercise 

the precious monetary policy independence we have been granted.  Our goal is to 

enhance the public’s trust in the Federal Reserve--our most valuable asset.

Figure 4.  Questions for the Review of Monetary Policy Strategy, Tools, and 
Communications 



1. Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its existing monetary 
policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that aim to reverse past misses of the 
inflation objective? 

2. Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and maintain maximum 
employment and price stability, or should the toolkit be expanded? 

3. How can the FOMC’s communication of its policy framework and implementation be 
improved?
