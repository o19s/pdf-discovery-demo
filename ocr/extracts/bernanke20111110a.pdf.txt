Town Hall Meeting with Soldiers and Their Families 
 

Fort Bliss, Texas 


November 10, 2011 


 It is an honor and a privilege for me to join the men and women of Fort Bliss 

today.  As someone who puts a high value on public service, I want to thank the soldiers 

here for their service to our country and for helping to make the world a safer place.  I 

admire your professionalism and dedication.  I want to thank your family members as 

well; servicemembers could not achieve what they do without the support and sacrifices 

of their families.  You should all be proud of what you have accomplished and what you 

stand for. 

 You may be wondering why the Chairman of the Federal Reserve would travel to 

Texas to speak at a military base.  I meet with groups with a wide range of backgrounds 

and perspectives on our economy to listen and learn, as well as to explain what the 

Federal Reserve is doing to try to improve our economic situation.  I’m here because the 

men and women in military service, like all Americans, are profoundly affected by the 

economic challenges our nation has faced these past several years.  Your hometowns may 

be struggling with foreclosures.  You may have had difficulty getting a loan to buy a car 

or a house.  You may have family members who have had trouble finding employment in 

a tough job market.  You may be worried about your own job prospects when the time 

comes for you to leave the military.  So this morning I thought I’d first say a few words 

about what the Federal Reserve is doing to help strengthen our economy and increase 

economic opportunity. 

 I also want to make sure you are aware of some of the special financial 

protections for people in the military.  Just this Tuesday I met with Holly Petraeus, head 

of the Office of Servicemembers Affairs in the new Consumer Financial Protection 

Bureau.  Ms. Petraeus and I share a common commitment to ensuring that the men and 


- 2 - 
 

women who protect the security of our country are themselves protected from predatory 

lending and other abusive financial practices.  I will also share a few thoughts about what 

each of you can do to give yourself the best shot at a promising financial future. 

Federal Reserve Efforts to Improve the Economy’s Performance 

 At the Federal Reserve, we are working hard--both as central bankers and as 

financial regulators--to help restore our nation’s prosperity.  In 2008 and early 2009, the 

world suffered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis which, had it 

been left unchecked, would have resulted in a global financial meltdown and an 

economic collapse.  Working with policymakers around the world, the Federal Reserve 

acted creatively and forcefully to help stabilize the financial system and halt the 

economic slide.  Our economy has been growing and adding jobs for more than two years 

now.  But for a lot of people, I know, it doesn’t feel like the recession ever ended.  The 

unemployment rate remains painfully high, and more than two-fifths of the unemployed 

have been out of work for longer than six months, by far the highest ratio since World 

War II.  These problems are very serious, and we at the Federal Reserve have been 

focusing intently on supporting job creation.  Supporting job creation is half of our 

marching orders, so to speak; the other half is controlling inflation.  Or, in the language 

of the law that sets the mandate for monetary policy, the Federal Reserve is required to 

seek both maximum employment and price stability.   

We pursue those two important goals by influencing the level of interest rates and 

other financial conditions.  My colleagues and I on the Federal Reserve’s monetary 

policymaking committee equate price stability with inflation being at 2 percent or a little 

less.  That rate is low enough that people and businesses can make financial decisions 


- 3 - 
 

without having to worry too much about rising costs, but high enough to keep the 

economy away from deflation--falling wages and prices--which is both a cause and a 

symptom of an extremely weak economy.  Although spikes in oil and food prices, and 

other transitory factors, pushed inflation up earlier this year, inflation appears to be 

moderating, and we expect, based on the best information that we have today, that it will 

remain reasonably close to our objective of 2 percent or a bit less for the foreseeable 

future. 

In the longer term, monetary policy is the main determinant of inflation, and so 

Federal Reserve policymakers have considerable latitude to choose our longer-term 

inflation goal.  In contrast, “maximum employment” depends on many factors outside of 

the Federal Reserve’s control, such as the skills of the workforce and the pace of 

technological innovation.  Right now, my colleagues on the Fed’s policymaking 

committee estimate that the U.S. economy could sustain an unemployment rate of 

somewhere between 5 and 6 percent without generating a buildup of inflation pressures.  

But, regardless of whether the sustainable rate is 5 or 6 percent, with unemployment 

currently at 9 percent, our economy is certainly falling far short of maximum 

employment.  That high unemployment rate is why the Federal Reserve is focusing its 

monetary policy at strengthening the recovery and job creation, including keeping short-

term interest rates near zero and longer-term rates, such as mortgage rates, at the lowest 

levels in decades.  Keeping borrowing costs very low supports consumer purchases of 

houses, cars, and other goods and services, as well as business investment in new 

equipment, software, and facilities.  Over time, greater demand on the part of households 

and businesses leads to increased economic activity and employment.

 Like other central banks around the world, one way in which we have put 

downward pressure on longer-term interest rates is by purchasing high-quality, longer-

term securities in the open market--specifically, in our case, U.S. government securities 

and federally backed mortgage securities.  It is important to understand that this type of 

activity isn’t the same as government spending.  We will sell the securities back into the 

market or simply allow them to mature as part of the process of tightening monetary 

policy when the economy improves.  In the meantime, we earn interest on the securities 

we hold.  In fact, the Federal Reserve’s securities purchases and other actions during and 

after the crisis have had the side effect of reducing the federal budget deficit.  Last year 

and the year before, we returned a total of $125 billion of those earnings to the U.S. 

Treasury, and payments to the Treasury in the current year will be substantial as well. 

 In addition to our monetary policy role, the Federal Reserve shares responsibility 

with other government agencies for regulating and supervising banks, protecting 

consumers in their financial dealings, and fostering financial stability.  We’re working 

with the other agencies to significantly increase the financial reserves that banks--

especially the largest banks that can put the financial system at risk--must hold against 

possible losses.  The Fed and the other agencies also are toughening the restrictions on 

the kinds of financial transactions that banks can undertake and working to ensure that 

bankers’ compensation packages do not give them incentives to take excessive risks.  We 

are requiring banks to compensate and assist foreclosed-upon homeowners who were 

unfairly treated.  And, importantly, we are working to increase the resilience of the 

financial system as a whole against financial and economic shocks that may occur in the 

future.  We are also collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to 


- 5 - 
 

implement new rules that will make it easier for the government to unwind big financial 

firms if they get into trouble, rather than being faced with the terrible choice of either 

bailing them out or risking the collapse of the financial system if they fail. 

 Of course, the Federal Reserve was never intended to shoulder the entire burden 

of promoting economic prosperity.  Fostering healthy growth and job creation is a shared 

responsibility of all economic policymakers, in close cooperation with the private sector.  

Spending and tax policy is of critical importance, but a wide range of other policies--

pertaining to labor markets, housing, trade, taxation, and regulation, for example--also 

have important roles to play. 

Financial Protections for Servicemembers 

 The Federal Reserve, along with the other agencies, is working hard to enforce an 

array of strengthened regulations that protect mortgage borrowers, credit card holders, 

and other consumers of financial services.  The people in this room should be aware, in 

particular, of the special rights and protections provided to military personnel by the 

Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.  The law’s purpose is to allow servicemembers to 

perform their duties without worry of foreclosure, eviction, and civil prosecution--under 

most circumstances.  It caps interest rates for debts incurred before a servicemember 

begins active duty, it prevents creditors from foreclosing on a home or repossessing a car 

without a court order, it gives servicemembers the option to terminate residential property 

and motor vehicle leases, it stays civil proceedings while servicemembers are on active 

duty, and it entitles servicemembers to reinstatement of health insurance that was in 

effect before their military service began.  Additionally, Department of Defense rules 

regulate the terms of certain kinds of high-cost loans to servicemembers and their 


- 6 - 
 

families, such as payday loans, tax refund anticipation loans, and motor vehicle title 

loans.   

Advice on Securing and Promising Financial Future 

 It takes more than rules, however sound, and enforcement, however diligent, to 

provide you and your families with a promising financial future.  While I have the pulpit, 

so to speak, permit me to offer three pieces of advice.  First, while you are in the military, 

take advantage of training opportunities.  Many specific skills learned in the military--

nursing and healthcare, mechanics, computer programming, police and security work--

transfer to civilian jobs.  The military also offers training in various life skills.  For 

instance, this morning I visited the Fort Bliss Army Community Service training center, 

which offers classes on such financial topics as budgeting, debt management, 

understanding credit, car buying, and protecting against identity theft.  More broadly, 

according to a recent study, 80 percent of veterans said their military experience helped 

them get ahead in life.1  They said the experience helped them mature, taught them to 

work with others, and built their self-confidence.  The value of military experience is 

reflected in the fact that the unemployment rate for veterans tends to be lower than the 

rate for non-veterans.2 

 Second, when you leave the military, take advantage of education benefits for 

veterans.  The Post-9/11 GI Bill pays for tuition and fees, a monthly housing allowance, 

and books and supplies.  Keep in mind that, on average, compared with high school

(not seasonally adjusted, age 18 and older).

graduates, people with college degrees earn about twice as much and suffer about half the 

rate of unemployment.3 

 Finally, educate yourself about your own personal finances.  Research by the 

Federal Reserve right here at Fort Bliss shows that financial education can pay off.4  

Beginning in 2003, the Federal Reserve collaborated with Army Emergency Relief, the 

U.S. Army’s own financial assistance organization, to provide a two-day financial 

education course, taught by the staff of San Diego City College, to younger enlisted 

soldiers--mostly men in their early 20s.  We surveyed them about their financial history 

and activities at the time of the course, and we did follow-up surveys in 2008 and 2009 of 

both servicemembers who had participated in the course and soldiers who had not.  We 

found that soldiers who had taken the course were more likely to make smart financial 

choices, such as comparison shopping for major purchases, saving for retirement, and 

educating themselves about money management.  They were less likely to make 

questionable financial decisions, like paying overdraft fees, taking out car title loans, and 

continually running credit card balances.  Making good, well-thought-out financial 

decisions can make all the difference to your financial future. 

Conclusion 

 I began my remarks by describing some of our country’s near-term economic 

challenges.  I want to end by sounding a note of optimism.  The U.S. economy remains

for those with only a high school education.

the largest in the world, with a highly diverse mix of industries and a degree of 

international competitiveness that, if anything, has improved in recent years.  The United 

States continues to be a great place to do business, with a strong system of laws, an 

entrepreneurial tradition, and flexible capital and labor markets.  And our country 

remains a technological leader, with many of the world’s leading research universities 

and the highest spending on research and development of any nation. 

Ultimately, these strengths will reassert themselves if our country takes the steps 

that are necessary to prepare for the future--for example, by putting the federal budget on 

a sustainable path and improving our primary and secondary education system.  The 

Federal Reserve will certainly do its part to help restore high rates of growth and 

employment in a context of price stability. 

 Let me end by again expressing my deep gratitude to all of you here for your 

service to our country.  I am happy to respond to your questions.
