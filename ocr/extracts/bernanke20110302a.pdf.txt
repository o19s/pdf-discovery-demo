I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to a group that has such a long and 

distinguished record in identifying and addressing crucial issues affecting the 

governments of the city and state of New York.  I will focus this evening on a top 

challenge not only for New York, but also for states and localities across the nation--

namely, the imperative of achieving fiscal sustainability in both the short and the long 

term.  I will first discuss the fiscal pressures currently confronting states and localities, 

then turn to longer-term challenges and opportunities faced by these jurisdictions. 

Recent State and Local Fiscal Developments 

  As you know well, the deep recession of 2008 through 2009 and the subsequent 

slow recovery have battered state and local budgets.  As the recession took hold, revenues 

dropped precipitously, especially at the state level.  Driven partly by balanced-budget 

requirements under their constitutions, many governments have responded by cutting 

numerous programs and reducing workforces.  As necessary as these cuts may have been, 

they have left some jurisdictions struggling to maintain essential services.  The fiscal 

problems of state and local governments have also had national implications, as their 

spending cuts and tax increases have been a headwind on the economic recovery.  

Moreover, concerns about both the current fiscal condition of these governments and 

their longer-term commitments to provide pensions and health benefits have recently led 

to strains in municipal bond markets. 

The recession’s effects on state governments have been substantial.  In calendar 

year 2009, state tax revenues were about 12 percent lower than they had been in 2008; 

declines in wages, salaries, capital gains, and profits reduced income tax revenues, and 

sales tax collections dropped along with household and business spending.  Reflecting

somewhat better economic conditions, state tax revenues for the first nine months of 2010 

were 3 percent higher than during the comparable period a year earlier--a relatively 

modest improvement in comparison to the earlier decline.  Meanwhile, on the spending 

side of the ledger, demand for publicly financed medical care and other public services 

soared as the economy weakened.  Most notably, Medicaid caseloads rose from less than 

43 million at the start of the recession in December 2007 to more than 50 million in June 

2010--an increase of nearly 18 percent.  The experience of New York state has not 

differed greatly from that of other states:  Tax revenues here decreased about 13 percent 

in 2009 and then rose about 7 percent during the first nine months of 2010.  Meanwhile, 

the state’s Medicaid enrollments increased from about 4 million at the end of 2007 to 

4-3/4 million in mid-2010--about in line with the national trend. 

  In contrast to the sharp drop in state tax revenues, local tax revenues across the 

country have held up relatively well over the past couple of years.  In part, this difference 

reflects localities’ greater reliance on property taxes.  Changes in real estate values 

typically feed through to tax assessments and property tax bills with a considerable lag; 

some jurisdictions have also raised their property tax rates to offset weakness in assessed 

values.  The continued softness in real estate prices, however, does not bode well for 

local government revenues.  Moreover, many localities have been hard hit by reductions 

in state aid, which in 2008 accounted for about 30 percent of local revenues.  Indeed, the 

fiscal 2011 budgets of more than 20 states contained either outright reductions in local 

aid, changes to revenue-sharing agreements, or cuts in funding for specific programs that 


 - 3 -

are run by local governments--such as education for grades kindergarten through 12, road 

maintenance, and property tax relief.1  

Assistance from the federal government--mainly through the stimulus grants 

included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) and the 

additional Medicaid and education grants provided last summer--has relieved some of the 

fiscal pressure on states and localities.  In addition, many of them have tapped financial 

reserves--or “rainy day” funds--and pursued asset sales and other one-time actions to 

satisfy balanced budget requirements.  Nonetheless, many governments have laid off or 

furloughed workers, frozen salaries, and cut other operating expenses.  Job cuts have 

been especially pronounced at the local level, where payrolls have fallen roughly 

350,000, or more than 2 percent, over the past 2-1/2 years; nearly half of the loss of local 

jobs has been in education. 

  In addition, state and local governments have cut their capital expenditures.  To 

be sure, construction of highways and transportation facilities has been well maintained 

over the past couple of years, partly because of the infrastructure grants and the Build 

America Bond program provided under the ARRA.  But outlays for the construction of 

schools to serve students in grades kindergarten through 12 now stand about 30 percent 

below their pre-recession level.  One might ask why states and localities are choosing to 

reduce capital expenditures, as these expenditures provide employment and economic 

benefits while typically not being subject to balanced budget requirements.  One reason is 

that some projects are funded at least partially out of operating budgets and thus must 

compete with Medicaid and other high-priority programs for scarce dollars.  Another is

Fiscal Survey of States (Washington: NASBO, Fall).

that a sizable share of debt service payments on the bonds used to finance capital projects 

comes from operating budgets, further limiting the flexibility and willingness of 

governments to undertake new infrastructure projects.  Finally, starting new capital 

projects may be difficult to justify politically in a period of general austerity. 

At least a few states have raised taxes and fees to address budget shortfalls.  As 

you know, in 2009 the state of New York enacted a package of revenue measures that 

included a temporary surcharge on taxes paid by high-income individuals.  California 

also raised income and sales taxes that year.  And after having seen its credit rating sink 

to among the lowest in the nation, Illinois recently implemented a sizable increase in 

income taxes. 

Despite the many difficult adjustments to date, state and local fiscal repair is far 

from complete, and governors, mayors, and legislators will confront more tough 

decisions as they develop their budgets for fiscal year 2012.  Although the economy is 

recovering, it is still operating well below potential and unemployment remains high.  

Stimulus grants from the federal government are winding down this year and will largely 

have ended by 2012.  Demands on Medicaid and other social service programs will likely 

remain elevated.  Moreover, reserve funds are low, and the list of unused one-time fixes 

has been substantially depleted. 

   Nonetheless, some positive developments have emerged lately.  For example, 

closest to home, Mayor Bloomberg announced last month that the city of New York has 

revised up its estimates of tax revenue for both the current and upcoming fiscal years.  As 

I noted earlier, state revenues nationwide have been rising recently, and states are 

generally reporting that collections are running in line with--and, in some cases, a bit 


 - 5 -

ahead of--expectations.  Accordingly, considerably fewer states are facing midyear 

budget gaps that will need to be addressed before the end of the current fiscal year than 

the 40 or so that reported such gaps in 2009 and 2010. 

Much will depend on the continuation of the economic recovery.  If the economy 

continues to strengthen at about the pace projected by the Federal Reserve and many 

private forecasters, states and localities may start to get a little breathing space.  Tax 

collections will rise with income and spending, and the use of Medicaid and other income 

support programs should ease as the labor market improves.  However, because the pace 

of near-term economic growth expected by most forecasters is relatively modest given 

the depth of the downturn, some time will likely be required before state and local fiscal 

conditions return to something approximating normal. 

  Continued evidence that states and localities are addressing fiscal shortfalls 

should help calm the municipal bond market.  Generally, that market seems to be 

functioning reasonably well.  Around the turn of the year, though, investor concerns 

about the fiscal situations of many governments, including those of some populous states, 

resulted in increased yields on municipal bonds relative to Treasury bonds as well as a 

widening of credit default swap spreads for a number of states.  Fortunately, although 

these measures of risk in the municipal bond market remain elevated, they have been 

looking somewhat better recently, presumably reflecting expectations of continuing 

improvement in the finances of states and localities.  The Federal Reserve will continue 

to monitor the municipal bond market closely.

Longer-Run Fiscal Challenges for States and Localities 

Although my focus thus far has been on the near term, state and local 

governments are also confronting some difficult fiscal challenges in the longer term.  

Indeed, with the retirement of public employees who are part of the baby-boom 

generation and the continued rise in health-care costs, meeting obligations for pension 

and retiree health-care expenses will become increasingly difficult for many states and 

localities.  Estimates of state and local governments’ unfunded pension liabilities for the 

nation as a whole span a wide range, with some researchers putting the figure in the 

neighborhood of $2 trillion to $3 trillion.2  Some governments are beginning to take 

difficult steps to address this problem, although their ability to change plan provisions is 

limited by the strong legal protection (including, in some states, constitutional protection) 

accorded to accrued pension benefits of public employees in many jurisdictions.3  

State and local governments also will have to address the burgeoning costs of 

retiree health benefits.  Estimates of these costs are subject to substantially greater 

uncertainty than are those for pension liabilities, largely because of the difficulty inherent 

in projecting overall health-care costs decades into the future.  In addition, retiree health 

plans generally do not have the same degree of explicit protection as do pensions and 

thus may be more subject to change.  With these uncertainties in mind, the prospective 

costs of providing retiree health benefits--though certainly consequential--appear to be 

somewhat smaller than unfunded pension liabilities.  For example, one recent estimate

generally seem to be accorded a lower level of protection.

suggests that state governments have a collective liability of almost $600 billion for 

retiree health benefits.4  

Not all of the longer-term issues facing state and local fiscal authorities involve 

closing budget gaps.  For example, in light of the recent experience, an important 

question is whether anything can be done to reduce the sensitivity of state and local 

budgets to the business cycle.  As the past couple of years have shown, the balanced-

budget rules under which most states operate can force sharp cuts in services and 

increases in taxes during recessions, which is just the time when many people in the state 

are economically most vulnerable.  Moreover, the instability in funding streams and tax 

rates associated with the business cycle can impede planning by both the public and the 

private sectors. 

By and large, the evidence suggests that balanced-budget rules provide valuable 

fiscal discipline for states, and I do not advocate eliminating them.5  However, even with 

these rules in place, the question remains whether the effects of the business cycle on 

state budgets can be mitigated in the future.  One strategy used by many governments is 

to build up a rainy day fund during good economic times.  Measured as a percent of 

general fund expenditures, the aggregate reserve-fund balances for all state governments 

stood at a record 11-1/2 percent at the end of fiscal 2006.  These comparatively high 

reserve-fund balances have lessened the severity of spending cuts or tax increases in 

many states during the past couple of years.  However, given the depth of the recession, 

even these historically high balances proved insufficient to fully buffer the budgets of

most states.  Thus, governments may wish to revisit their criteria for accumulating and 

using fiscal reserves.  Building an adequate reserve fund during good times may not be 

politically popular, but doing so can pay off during bad times as well as lessen the 

tendency to overspend when times are good. 

In principle, some smoothing of expenditures over good and bad times could also 

take place through the capital budget.  In particular, maintaining or even increasing the 

pace of construction spending when the economy is weak could add valuable 

infrastructure and provide local jobs; it may even allow a government to get more “bang 

for the buck” because of increased competition among private contractors when demand 

is slack.  Voters and policymakers may understandably be reluctant to approve new bond 

issues and take on additional costs for debt payments in a period of fiscal and economic 

stress, but they might be less reluctant if governments were to accumulate larger rainy 

day funds and assign a higher priority to tapping them for infrastructure purposes in times 

of economic weakness. 

Another development that has compounded the difficulties faced by many state 

governments is that their revenues--always sensitive to economic conditions--appear to 

have become even more tied to the economy over time.  One reason for this greater 

sensitivity is that capital income, which tends to vary substantially more than wage and 

salary income, has become an increasingly important source of state personal income 

taxes.6  Also, sales taxes may have become more cyclical because of an increasing 

tendency to exempt certain necessities, for which demand is relatively more stable.  As

state legislatures review their tax systems, they may wish to consider steps to enhance the 

cyclical stability of their revenue streams.  Of course, many considerations enter into tax 

policy, including the fairness of the code, the support it provides for economic growth 

and development, and the level of administrative and compliance costs. 

Budget balance and budget stability are important fiscal issues.  In the long run, 

though, the most important fiscal issue is whether the structure and composition of the 

government budget best serves the public interest.  Certainly, most people would support 

the goal of fostering healthy economic growth.  Government can contribute to this 

objective in a number of ways.  One critical means is by ensuring an adequate investment 

in human capital--that is, in the knowledge and skills of our people.  No economy can 

succeed without a high-quality workforce, particularly in an age of globalization and 

technical change.  Cost-effective K-12 and post-secondary schooling are crucial to 

building a better workforce, but they are only part of the story.  Research increasingly has 

shown the benefits of early childhood education and efforts to promote the lifelong 

acquisition of skills for both individuals and the economy as a whole.  The payoffs of 

early childhood programs can be especially high.7  For instance, preschool programs for 

disadvantaged children have been shown to increase high school graduation rates.8  

Because high school graduates have higher earnings, pay more taxes, and are less likely 

to use public health programs, investing in such programs can pay off even from the 

narrow perspective of state budgets; of course, the returns to the overall economy and to 

the individuals themselves are much greater.

Additionally, in a dynamic economy in which job requirements are evolving more 

rapidly than ever, individuals already in the workforce need opportunities to improve 

their skills throughout their lives.  There are many ways to provide such opportunities.  

For example, community colleges and vocational schools train and retrain workers, often 

in close collaboration with private employers, and in many cases they perform this 

function at a relatively low cost.  Although helping workers acquire up-to-date skills is 

always important, it is especially critical now, when long spells of unemployment are 

threatening the longer-term employability and productivity of many. 

Conclusion 

Tonight I have highlighted some of the fiscal challenges faced by elected 

officials, both in New York and in other regions.  In the past few years, the weak 

economy has significantly reduced government revenues, which in turn has forced 

governments to make difficult decisions on spending and taxes.  An improving economy 

should help, but state and local finances will remain under pressure for some time.  

Moreover, states and localities are facing difficult longer-run issues related to pension 

and health-related expenses for their retired employees.  These challenges are daunting 

indeed, but meeting them will be essential to ensuring that our resilient and dynamic 

economy delivers rising living standards to the citizens of New York and to our nation as 

a whole.
