Monitoring the Financial System 




Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


49th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition 

sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 


Chicago, Illinois 








May 10, 2013 





We are now more than four years beyond the most intense phase of the financial 

crisis, but its legacy remains.  Our economy has not yet fully regained the jobs lost in the 

recession that accompanied the financial near collapse.  And our financial system--

despite significant healing over the past four years--continues to struggle with the 

economic, legal, and reputational consequences of the events of 2007 to 2009.   

The crisis also engendered major shifts in financial regulatory policy and practice.  

Not since the Great Depression have we seen such extensive changes in financial 

regulation as those codified in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) in the United States and, internationally, in the Basel III 

Accord and a range of other initiatives.  This new regulatory framework is still under 

construction, but the Federal Reserve has already made significant changes to how it 

conceptualizes and carries out both its regulatory and supervisory role and its 

responsibility to foster financial stability. 

In my remarks today I will discuss the Federal Reserve’s efforts in an area that 

typically gets less attention than the writing and implementation of new rules--namely, 

our ongoing monitoring of the financial system.  Of course, the Fed has always paid close 

attention to financial markets, for both regulatory and monetary policy purposes.  

However,  in recent years, we have both greatly increased the resources we devote to 

monitoring and taken a more systematic and intensive approach, led by our Office of 

Financial Stability Policy and Research and drawing on substantial resources from across 

the Federal Reserve System.  This monitoring informs the policy decisions of both the 

Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Open Market Committee as well as our work with 

other agencies. 


 - 2 - 

The step-up in our monitoring is motivated importantly by a shift in financial 

regulation and supervision toward a more macroprudential, or systemic, approach, 

supplementing our traditional microprudential perspective focused primarily on the 

health of individual institutions and markets.  In the spirit of this more systemic approach 

to oversight, the Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

(FSOC), which is comprised of the heads of a number of federal and state regulatory 

agencies.  The FSOC has fostered greater interaction among financial regulatory agencies 

as well as a sense of common responsibility for overall financial stability.  Council 

members regularly discuss risks to financial stability and produce an annual report, which 

reviews potential risks and recommends ways to mitigate them.

  The Federal Reserve’s 

broad-based monitoring efforts have been essential for promoting a close and well-

informed collaboration with other FSOC members. 

A Focus on Vulnerabilities 

Ongoing monitoring of the financial system is vital to the macroprudential 

approach to regulation.  Systemic risks can only be defused if they are first identified.  

That said, it is reasonable to ask whether systemic risks can in fact be reliably identified 

in advance; after all, neither the Federal Reserve nor economists in general predicted the 

past crisis.  To respond to this point, I will distinguish, as I have elsewhere, between 

triggers and vulnerabilities.
2
  The triggers of any crisis are the particular events that touch

off the crisis--the proximate causes, if you will.  For the 2007-09 crisis, a prominent 

trigger was the losses suffered by holders of subprime mortgages.  In contrast, the 

vulnerabilities associated with a crisis are preexisting features of the financial system that 

amplify and propagate the initial shocks.  Examples of vulnerabilities include high levels 

of leverage, maturity transformation, interconnectedness, and complexity, all of which 

have the potential to magnify shocks to the financial system.  Absent vulnerabilities, 

triggers might produce sizable losses to certain firms, investors, or asset classes but 

would generally not lead to full-blown financial crises; the collapse of the relatively small 

market for subprime mortgages, for example, would not have been nearly as 

consequential without preexisting fragilities in securitization practices and short-term 

funding markets which greatly increased its impact.  Of course, monitoring can and does 

attempt to identify potential triggers--indications of an asset bubble, for example--but 

shocks of one kind or another are inevitable, so identifying and addressing vulnerabilities 

is key to ensuring that the financial system overall is robust.  Moreover, attempts to 

address specific vulnerabilities can be supplemented by broader measures--such as 

requiring banks to hold more capital and liquidity--that make the system more resilient to 

a range of shocks. 

Two other related points motivate our increased monitoring.  The first is that the 

financial system is dynamic and evolving not only because of innovation and the 

changing needs of the economy, but also because financial activities tend to migrate from 

more-regulated to less-regulated sectors.  An innovative feature of the Dodd-Frank Act is 

that it includes mechanisms to permit the regulatory system, at least in some 

circumstances, to adapt to such changes.  For example, the act gives the FSOC powers to 


 - 4 - 

designate systemically important institutions, market utilities, and activities for additional 

oversight.  Such designation is essentially a determination that an institution or activity 

creates or exacerbates a vulnerability of the financial system, a determination that can 

only be made with comprehensive monitoring and analysis. 

The second motivation for more intensive monitoring is the apparent tendency for 

financial market participants to take greater risks when macro conditions are relatively 

stable.  Indeed, it may be that prolonged economic stability is a double-edged sword.  To 

be sure, a favorable overall environment reduces credit risk and strengthens balance 

sheets, all else being equal, but it could also reduce the incentives for market participants 

to take reasonable precautions, which may lead in turn to a buildup of financial 

vulnerabilities.  Probably our best defense against complacency during extended periods 

of calm is careful monitoring for signs of emerging vulnerabilities and, where 

appropriate, the development of macroprudential and other policy tools that can be used 

to address them. 

The Federal Reserve’s Financial Stability Monitoring Program 

So, what specifically does the Federal Reserve monitor?  In the remainder of my 

remarks, I’ll highlight and discuss four components of the financial system that are 

among those we follow most closely:  systemically important financial institutions 

(SIFIs), shadow banking, asset markets, and the nonfinancial sector.

 The remainder of my remarks draws heavily on Tobias Adrian, Daniel Covitz, and Nellie Liang (2013), 

“Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-21 (Washington:  Board 

of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April), 

www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321pap.pdf.  This paper provides more details on the 

Federal Reserve’s financial stability monitoring program.  I thank the authors for their assistance with these 

remarks. 


 - 5 - 

Systemically Important Financial Institutions 

SIFIs are financial firms whose distress or failure has the potential to create 

broader financial instability sufficient to inflict meaningful damage on the real economy.  

SIFIs tend to be large, but size is not the only factor used to determine whether a firm is 

systemically important; other factors include the firm’s interconnectedness with the rest 

of the financial system, the complexity and opacity of its operations, the nature and extent 

of its risk-taking, its use of leverage, its reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and the 

extent of its cross-border operations.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the largest bank 

holding companies are treated as SIFIs; in addition, as I mentioned, the act gives the 

FSOC the power to designate individual nonbank financial companies as systemically 

important.  This designation process is under way. 

Dodd-Frank also establishes a framework for subjecting SIFIs to comprehensive 

supervisory oversight and enhanced prudential standards.  For all such companies, the 

Federal Reserve will have access to confidential supervisory information and will 

monitor standard indicators such as regulatory capital, leverage, and funding mix.  

However, some of these measures, such as regulatory capital ratios, tend to be backward 

looking and thus may be slow to flag unexpected, rapid changes in the condition of a 

firm.  Accordingly, we supplement the more standard measures with other types of 

information. 

One valuable source of supplementary information is stress testing.  Regular, 

comprehensive stress tests are an increasingly important component of the Federal 

Reserve’s supervisory toolkit, having been used in our assessment of large bank holding 


 - 6 - 

companies since 2009.
4
  To administer a stress test, supervisors first construct a 

hypothetical scenario that assumes a set of highly adverse economic and financial 

developments--for example, a deep recession combined with sharp declines in the prices 

of houses and other assets.  The tested firms and their supervisors then independently 

estimate firms’ projected losses, revenues, and capital under the hypothetical scenario, 

and the results are publicly disclosed.  Firms are evaluated both on their post-stress 

capital levels and on their ability to analyze their exposures and capital needs. 

Stress testing provides a number of advantages over more-standard approaches to 

assessing capital adequacy.  First, measures of capital based on stress tests are both more 

forward looking and more robust to “tail risk”--that is, to extremely adverse 

developments of the sort most likely to foster broad-based financial instability.  Second, 

because the Federal Reserve conducts stress tests simultaneously on the major institutions 

it supervises, the results can be used both for comparative analyses across firms and to 

judge the collective susceptibility of major financial institutions to certain types of 

shocks.  Indeed, comparative reviews of large financial institutions have become an 

increasingly important part of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory toolkit more generally.   

Third, the disclosure of stress-test results, which increased investor confidence during the 

crisis, can also strengthen market discipline in normal times.  The stress tests thus provide 

critical information about key financial institutions while also forcing the firms to 

improve their ability to measure and manage their risk exposures. 

                                                 
4
 The Federal Reserve’s stress-testing program is discussed in Ben S. Bernanke (2013), “Stress Testing 

Banks:  What Have We Learned?” speech delivered at “Maintaining Financial Stability:  Holding a Tiger 

by the Tail,” a financial markets conference sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, held in 

Stone Mountain, Ga., April 8-10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20130408a.htm.  

More limited forms of stress testing were used by supervisors before 2009.  


 - 7 - 

Stress-testing techniques can also be used in more-focused assessments of the 

banking sector’s vulnerability to specific risks not captured in the main scenario, such as 

liquidity risk or interest rate risk.  Like comprehensive stress tests, such focused exercises 

are an important element of our supervision of SIFIs.  For example, supervisors are 

collecting detailed data on liquidity that help them compare firms’ susceptibilities to 

various types of funding stresses and to evaluate firms’ strategies for managing their 

liquidity.  Supervisors also are working with firms to assess how profitability and capital 

would fare under various stressful interest rate scenarios. 

Federal Reserve staff members supplement supervisory and stress-test 

information with other measures.  For example, though supervisors have long appreciated 

the value of market-based indicators in evaluating the conditions of systemically 

important firms (or, indeed, any publicly traded firm), our monitoring program uses 

market information to a much greater degree than in the past.  Thus, in addition to 

standard indicators--such as stock prices and the prices of credit default swaps, which 

capture market views about individual firms--we use market-based measures of systemic 

stability derived from recent research.  These measures use correlations of asset prices to 

capture the market’s perception of a given firm’s potential to destabilize the financial 

system at a time when the broader financial markets are stressed; other measures estimate 

the vulnerability of a given firm to disturbances emanating from elsewhere in the 

system.
5
  The further development of market-based measures of systemic vulnerabilities 

and systemic risk is a lively area of research. 

                                                 
5
 For example, conditional value at risk provides an estimate of the systemic importance of a firm at a 

moment in time, based on how the firm’s equity value and broader equity values co-vary when overall 

conditions are very adverse; see Tobias Adrian and Markus K. Brunnermeier (2008; revised September 

2011), “CoVaR,” Staff Reports 348 (New York:  Federal Reserve Bank of New York, September), 


 - 8 - 

Network analysis, yet another promising tool under active development, has the 

potential to help us better monitor the interconnectedness of financial institutions and 

markets.  Interconnectedness can arise from common holdings of assets or through the 

exposures of firms to their counterparties.  Network measures rely on concepts used in 

engineering, communications, and neuroscience to map linkages among financial firms 

and market activities.  The goals are to identify key nodes or clusters that could 

destabilize the system and to simulate how a shock, such as the sudden distress of a firm, 

could be transmitted and amplified through the network.  These tools can also be used to 

analyze the systemic stability effects of a change in the structure of a network.  For 

example, margin rules affect the sensitivity of firms to the conditions of their 

counterparties; thus, margin rules affect the likelihood of financial contagion through 

various firms and markets. 

Shadow Banking 

Shadow banking, a second area we closely monitor, was an important source of 

instability during the crisis.  Shadow banking comprises various markets and institutions 

that provide financial intermediation outside the traditional, regulated banking system.  

Shadow banking includes vehicles for credit intermediation, maturity transformation, 

liquidity provision, and risk sharing.  Such vehicles are typically funded on a largely 

short-term basis from wholesale sources.  In the run-up to the crisis, the shadow banking 

                                                                                                                                                 
www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr348.pdf.  The distressed insurance premium uses information 

from firms’ credit default swap spreads and equity prices to measure the implied cost of insuring a given 

firm against broader financial distress--an indicator of the vulnerability of the firm to systemic instability; 

see Xin Huang, Hao Zhou, and Haibin Zhu (2009), “A Framework for Assessing the Systemic Risk of 

Major Financial Institutions,” Journal of Banking and Finance, vol. 33 (November), pp. 2036-49.  The 

systemic expected shortfall uses firm equity prices, leverage, and volatility to measure the propensity of a 

firm to be undercapitalized given a marketwide decline in equity prices; see Viral V. Acharya, Lasse H. 

Pedersen, Thomas Philippon, and Matthew Richardson (2010), “Measuring Systemic Risk,” unpublished 

paper, New York University, Leonard Stern School of Business, May, 

http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/public/static/SR-v3.pdf.

sector involved a high degree of maturity transformation and leverage.  Illiquid loans to 

households and businesses were securitized, and the tranches of the securitizations with 

the highest credit ratings were funded by very short-term debt, such as asset-backed 

commercial paper and repurchase agreements (repos).  The short-term funding was in 

turn provided by institutions, such as money market funds, whose investors expected 

payment in full on demand and had little tolerance for risk to principal.   

As it turned out, the ultimate investors did not fully understand the quality of the 

assets they were financing.  Investors were lulled by triple-A credit ratings and by 

expected support from sponsoring institutions--support that was, in fact, discretionary and 

not always provided.  When investors lost confidence in the quality of the assets or in the 

institutions expected to provide support, they ran.  Their flight created serious funding 

pressures throughout the financial system, threatened the solvency of many firms, and 

inflicted serious damage on the broader economy. 

Securities broker-dealers play a central role in many aspects of shadow banking as 

facilitators of market-based intermediation.  To finance their own and their clients’ 

securities holdings, broker-dealers tend to rely on short-term collateralized funding, often 

in the form of repo agreements with highly risk-averse lenders.  The crisis revealed that 

this funding is potentially quite fragile if lenders have limited capacity to analyze the 

collateral or counterparty risks associated with short-term secured lending, but rather look 

at these transactions as nearly risk free.  As questions emerged about the nature and value 

of collateral, worried lenders either greatly increased margin requirements or, more 

commonly, pulled back entirely.  Borrowers unable to meet margin calls and finance their 


 - 10 - 

asset holdings were forced to sell, driving down asset prices further and setting off a 

cycle of deleveraging and further asset liquidation.  

To monitor intermediation by broker-dealers, the Federal Reserve in 2010 created 

a quarterly Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms, which asks 

dealers about the credit they provide.
6
  Modeled on the long-established Senior Loan 

Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices sent to commercial banks, the survey 

of senior credit officers at dealers tracks conditions in markets such as those for securities 

financing, prime brokerage, and derivatives trading.
7
  The credit officer survey is 

designed to monitor potential vulnerabilities stemming from the greater use of leverage 

by investors (particularly through lending backed by less-liquid collateral) or increased 

volumes of maturity transformation.  Before the financial crisis, we had only very limited 

information regarding such trends.   

We have other potential sources of information about shadow banking.  The 

Treasury Department’s Office of Financial Research and Federal Reserve staff are 

collaborating to construct data sets on triparty and bilateral repo transactions, which 

should facilitate the development of better monitoring metrics for repo activity and 

improve transparency in these markets.  We also talk regularly to market participants 

about developments, paying particular attention to the creation of new financial vehicles 

that foster greater maturity transformation outside the regulated sector, provide funding 

for less-liquid assets, or transform risks from forms that are more easily measured to 

forms that are more opaque.

 - 11 - 

A fair summary is that, while the shadow banking sector is smaller today than 

before the crisis and some of its least stable components have either disappeared or been 

reformed, regulators and the private sector need to address remaining vulnerabilities.  For 

example, although money market funds were strengthened by reforms undertaken by the 

Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2010, the possibility of a run on these 

funds remains--for instance, if a fund should “break the buck,” or report a net asset value 

below 99.5 cents, as the Reserve Primary Fund did in 2008.  The risk is increased by the 

fact that the Treasury no longer has the power to guarantee investors’ holdings in money 

funds, an authority that was critical for stopping the 2008 run.  In November 2012, the 

FSOC proposed for public comment some alternative approaches for the reform of 

money funds.  The SEC is currently considering these and other possible steps. 

With respect to the triparty repo platform, progress has been made in reducing the 

amount of intraday credit extended by the clearing banks in the course of the daily 

settlement process, and, as additional enhancements are made, the extension of such 

credit should be largely eliminated by the end of 2014.  However, important risks remain 

in the short-term wholesale funding markets.  One of the key risks is how the system 

would respond to the failure of a broker-dealer or other major borrower.  The Dodd-

Frank Act has provided important additional tools to deal with this vulnerability, notably 

the provisions that facilitate an orderly resolution of a broker-dealer or a broker-dealer 

holding company whose imminent failure poses a systemic risk.  But, as highlighted in 

the FSOC’s most recent annual report, more work is needed to better prepare investors 


 - 12 - 

and other market participants to deal with the potential consequences of a default by a 

large participant in the repo market.
8
   

Asset Markets 

Asset markets are a third area that we closely monitor.  We follow developments 

in markets for a wide range of assets, including public and private fixed-income 

instruments, corporate equities, real estate, commodities, and structured credit products, 

among others.  Foreign as well as domestic markets receive close attention, as do global 

linkages, such as the effects of the ongoing European fiscal and banking problems on 

U.S. markets. 

 Not surprisingly, we try to identify unusual patterns in valuations, such as 

historically high or low ratios of prices to earnings in equity markets.  We use a variety of 

models and methods; for example, we use empirical models of default risk and risk 

premiums to analyze credit spreads in corporate bond markets.  These assessments are 

complemented by other information, including measures of volumes, liquidity, and 

market functioning, as well as intelligence gleaned from market participants and outside 

analysts.  In light of the current low interest rate environment, we are watching 

particularly closely for instances of “reaching for yield” and other forms of excessive 

risk-taking, which may affect asset prices and their relationships with fundamentals.  It is 

worth emphasizing that looking for historically unusual patterns or relationships in asset 

prices can be useful even if you believe that asset markets are generally efficient in 

setting prices.  For the purpose of safeguarding financial stability, we are less concerned 

about whether a given asset price is justified in some average sense than in the possibility

 - 13 - 

of a sharp move.  Asset prices that are far from historically normal levels would seem to 

be more susceptible to such destabilizing moves. 

From a financial stability perspective, however, the assessment of asset valuations 

is only the first step of the analysis.  Also to be considered are factors such as the 

leverage and degree of maturity mismatch being used by the holders of the asset, the 

liquidity of the asset, and the sensitivity of the asset’s value to changes in broad financial 

conditions.  Differences in these factors help explain why the correction in equity markets 

in 2000 and 2001 did not induce widespread systemic disruptions, while the collapse in 

house prices and in the quality of mortgage credit during the 2007-09 crisis had much 

more far-reaching effects:  The losses from the stock market declines in 2000 and 2001 

were widely diffused, while mortgage losses were concentrated--and, through various 

financial instruments, amplified--in critical parts of the financial system, resulting 

ultimately in panic, asset fire sales, and the collapse of credit markets. 

Nonfinancial Sector 

Our financial stability monitoring extends to the nonfinancial sector, including 

households and businesses.  Research has identified excessive growth in credit and 

leverage in the private nonfinancial sector as potential indicators of systemic risk.
9
  

Highly leveraged or financially fragile households and businesses are less able to 

withstand adverse changes in income or wealth, including those brought about by 

deteriorating conditions in financial and credit markets.  A highly leveraged economy is 

also more prone to so-called financial accelerator effects, as when financially stressed

Countercyclical Capital Buffers:  The Role of Credit Aggregates,” International Journal of Central 

Banking, vol. 7 (December), pp. 189-240; and Rochelle M. Edge and Ralf R. Meisenzahl (2011), “The 

Unreliability of Credit-to-GDP Ratio Gaps in Real Time:  Implications for Countercyclical Capital 

Buffers,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 7 (December), pp. 261-98.

firms are forced to lay off workers who, in turn, lacking financial reserves, sharply cut 

their own spending.  Financial stress in the nonfinancial sector--for example, higher 

default rates on mortgages or corporate debt--can also damage financial institutions, 

creating a potential adverse feedback loop as they reduce the availability of credit and 

shed assets to conserve capital, thereby further weakening the financial positions of 

households and firms. 

The vulnerabilities of the nonfinancial sector can potentially be captured by both 

stock measures (such as wealth and leverage) and flow measures (such as the ratio of 

debt service to income).  Sector-wide data are available from a number of sources, 

importantly the Federal Reserve’s flow of funds accounts, which is a set of aggregate 

integrated financial accounts that measures sources and uses of funds for major sectors as 

well as for the economy as a whole.
10

  These accounts allow us to trace the flow of credit 

from its sources, such as banks or wholesale funding markets, to the household and 

business sectors that receive it.   

The Federal Reserve also now monitors detailed consumer- and business-level 

data suited for picking up changes in the nature of borrowing and lending, as well as for 

tracking financial conditions of those most exposed to a cyclical downturn or a reversal 

of fortunes.  For example, during the housing boom, the aggregate data accurately 

showed the outsized pace of home mortgage borrowing, but it could not reveal the 

pervasive deterioration in underwriting that implied a substantial increase in the 

underlying credit risk from that activity.

have been concentrated among wealthier households, while many households in the 

middle or lower parts of the distribution have experienced declines in wealth since the 

crisis.  Moreover, many homeowners remain “underwater,” with their homes worth less 

than the principal balances on their mortgages.  Thus, more detailed information clarifies 

that many households remain more financially fragile than might be inferred from the 

aggregate statistics alone. 

Conclusion 

 In closing, let me reiterate that while the effective regulation and supervision of 

individual financial institutions will always be crucial to ensuring a well-functioning 

financial system, the Federal Reserve is moving toward a more systemic approach that 

also pays close attention to the vulnerabilities of the financial system as a whole.  Toward 

that end, we are pursuing an active program of financial monitoring, supported by 

expanded research and data collection, often undertaken in conjunction with other U.S. 

financial regulatory agencies.  Our stepped-up monitoring and analysis is already 

providing important information for the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee 

as well as for the broader regulatory community.  We will continue to work toward 

improving our ability to detect and address vulnerabilities in our financial system.
