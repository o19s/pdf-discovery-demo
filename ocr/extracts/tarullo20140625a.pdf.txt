Stress Testing after Five Years 


Remarks by 


Daniel K. Tarullo 


Member 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 

Federal Reserve Third Annual Stress Test Modeling Symposium 



Boston 




Born of necessity during the depths of the financial crisis as part of an effort to restore 

confidence in the U.S. financial system, supervisory stress testing has in the intervening five 

years become a cornerstone of a new approach to regulation and supervision of the nation’s 

largest financial institutions.  First, of course, it is a means for assuring that large, complex 

financial institutions have sufficient capital to allow them to remain viable intermediaries even 

under highly stressful conditions.  More broadly, supervisory stress testing and the associated 

review of capital planning processes have provided a platform for building out a regulatory 

framework that is more dynamic, more macroprudential, and more data-driven than pre-crisis 

practice.   

 Each year we have refined elements of both the substance and process of the stress tests.  

These changes have been informed not only by our own experience, but also by critiques and 

suggestions offered by others.  This annual symposium hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of 

Boston has become an important channel for eliciting reactions and advice from outside experts 

and the banks subject to the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).  

Although the major elements of our approach have now been successfully established, I 

anticipate that we will continue to make enhancements.  If supervisory stress testing is to give 

regulators, banks, and the public a dynamic view of the capital positions of large financial firms, 

it must itself respond to changes in the economy, the financial system, and risk-management 

capabilities. 

 This morning I will give a retrospective on the first five years of supervisory stress 

testing, highlighting some of the accomplishments and identifying some areas in which we may 

consider changes in the future.  Then I would like to turn to a topic that has gained increasing 


- 2 - 
 

attention in the past couple of years--the qualitative assessment of firms’ capital planning 

processes that we conduct in parallel with our quantitative assessment of firms’ capital positions. 

From SCAP to CCAR 

The potential value of comprehensive stress testing had been much discussed among 

academics, analysts, and regulators in the years preceding the financial crisis, but only during the 

crisis was this supervisory tool first used at the same time across the largest firms.  The 

Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) demonstrated in practice, not just in theory, 

the value of simultaneous, forward-looking projections of potential losses and revenues based on 

each bank’s portfolio and circumstances.  The forward-looking feature overcame the limitations 

of static capital ratios.  The simultaneity, along with stress test features such as the use of 

common macroeconomic scenarios, introduced a critical macroprudential dimension that offered 

insights into the condition of the entire financial system, including whether banks were 

sufficiently resilient to continue to lend to households and businesses under such adverse 

conditions. 

The Federal Reserve’s basic approach to stress testing has not changed materially since 

the SCAP.  We continue to take a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on a wide range of staff 

expertise.  We create hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios that incorporate an assumed sharp 

deterioration in economic and financial conditions.  Supervisors estimate each bank’s expected 

losses and revenues and use these estimates to project post-stress capital levels and ratios under 

the hypothetical scenarios.  The estimated capital ratios are then compared with regulatory 

benchmarks.  We use common scenarios for all firms; for the firms with the largest trading 

activities, we add a market-shock scenario that incorporates market turbulence of severity similar 

to that of the latter half of 2008.   


- 3 - 
 

While the basic approach has remained consistent, much else has changed.  In the first 

place, of course, the requirement for stress testing has become statutory, as Congress drew on the 

lessons of SCAP in crafting prudential standards for large financial firms in the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).1  Second, the annual 

supervisory stress test has been incorporated into CCAR, a broader program that requires large 

banking organizations to submit a capital plan annually.  The CCAR process gives supervisors 

an opportunity to evaluate plans for capital distributions against the backdrop of the firm’s 

overall capital position under both baseline and hypothesized stressed conditions.  It also 

provides a regular, structured, and comparative way to assess the capacity of these firms to 

manage their capital positions and, by implication, more generally to manage their risks.  I will 

return to this feature of CCAR a bit later. 

Third, there have been substantial enhancements to the supervisory stress test.  Perhaps 

the most important change has been the development of independent supervisory models.  

Because the original SCAP was developed on the fly and under considerable time pressure, 

supervisors necessarily had to rely on firms’ own estimates of losses and revenues as a starting 

point for analysis, although they evaluated the firms’ estimates and made significant adjustments.  

In each stress test that has followed, and building upon the considerable progress in data 

collection, we have made completely independent estimates of a progressively greater proportion 

of potential net income or losses.  These improvements in data and models have increased our 

ability to distinguish risks within portfolios.   

We have also refined the formulation of the hypothetical scenarios that form the basis of 

the stress tests.  The severely adverse scenario is designed to reflect, at a minimum, the economic 

                                                 
1 Dodd-Frank Act §165(i), 12 U.S.C. §5365(i).

and financial conditions typical of a severe post-World War II U.S. recession.2  In devising 

recession scenarios, we draw on many of the same macroeconomic modeling tools used in 

making monetary policy.  Because not all significant risks facing banks are tied to the business 

cycle, our scenarios now incorporate other adverse developments such as an exceptionally large 

decline in house prices, sharp drops in the value of stocks and other financial assets, or a 

worsening of global economic conditions more severe than might normally be expected to 

accompany a deep recession in the United States.  We have implemented the Dodd-Frank 

requirement for an “adverse,” as well as a “severely adverse,” scenario not by simply 

hypothesizing a milder recession, but by testing for somewhat different risks.  The past two years 

we have used the adverse scenario to test the impact of a sudden, significant increase in interest 

rates. 

More discrete changes of note include the assumption of default by each firm’s largest 

counterparty and the incorporation of salient risks beyond those in the overall scenarios.3  The 

former obviously serves a microprudential purpose, but it also could promote systemic stability 

objectives if it were to identify a single exceptionally large exposure for the entire financial 

system.  The incorporation of salient risks helps to use stress tests to “lean against the wind,” not 

just build a buffer for future losses.  For example, the 2011 and 2012 scenarios incorporated 

possible severe stress in Europe.  Inclusion of this factor may have led to greater awareness and 

better risk management of U.S. firms’ European exposures.

 Finally, I might mention a change made this year that actually reverted to a feature of the 

SCAP.  We did not allow banks to assume their balance sheets would shrink in the stress 

scenarios as a way of meeting the minimum capital charge, something that many banks had done 

in the stress tests of the past few years.4  Foreclosing this assumption serves the macroprudential 

goal of helping to ensure that the major financial firms remain sufficiently capitalized to support 

lending in a severe downturn. 

 As I have already suggested, we are likely to continue to hone the supervisory stress test.  

In particular, I expect that we will devote more attention to developing the macroprudential 

elements of the stress tests.  For example, we might sharpen our focus on the risks to the 

financial system of significant common exposures among firms.  We have already adjusted the 

market shock applied to the trading books of the six largest firms to ensure that firms are not 

incentivized to hold significant amounts of certain assets simply because they performed well in 

the second half of 2008.5  But there is more that could be done.  One idea would be to test 

whether individual firms that are revealed by the tests to be vulnerable to serious stress might 

engage in asset fire sales that could produce knock-on damage to other firms.  Another would be 

to incorporate more assumptions pertaining to the increased cost of, or reduced access to, 

funding in stressed environments, when lots of credit lines may be drawn simultaneously. 

 In short, we do not regard the supervisory stress test and CCAR as finished products.  In 

fact, we should never regard them as finished products, since to do so would be to overlook 

                                                 
4 Prior to CCAR 2014, the Board sent CCAR participants a letter detailing the Federal Reserve’s procedure for 
independently projecting the firms’ balance sheets and risk-weighted assets in the supervisory stress test and the 
implications of the independent projections. See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), 
“Federal Reserve Independent Balance Sheet and RWA Projections,” December 
16, www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/independent-projections-letter-20131216.pdf.

changes in the real economy, financial innovations, and shifts in asset correlations across firms.  

But I think it fair to say that supervisory stress testing and the CCAR have already made 

important contributions to financial stability and, in the process, have led the way in 

transforming supervision of the nation’s largest financial firms. 

First, they have played a key role in strengthening dramatically the capital position of the 

industry.  The firms participating in CCAR have more than doubled their tier 1 common capital 

since 2009, an increase of $500 billion of additional, high-quality capital in the U.S. financial 

system.  It is noteworthy that supervisors in other countries have themselves been moving toward 

greater use of stress tests as a centerpiece of efforts to build strong capital positions for their 

banks.  Most members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision now use some form of 

stress testing.6  The European Union and the United Kingdom are currently conducting 

supervisory stress tests whose results will be publicly released. 

Second, they have been the leading edge of a movement toward greater supervisory 

transparency.  The Federal Reserve’s decision in spring 2009 to disclose the results of the SCAP 

on a firm-specific basis proved to be an important step in re-establishing market and public 

confidence in the U.S. financial system.  In the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress endorsed the practice 

of disclosing both supervisory and firm stress test results in normal times, as well as in crisis 

periods.  During the past five years we have progressively increased disclosures of firm-specific 

information, the methodologies we use, and the details of the stress test scenarios.  From the 

outset, we have published the broad framework and methodology used in the supervisory stress

Testing Principles (Basel: BIS, April), p. 8, www.bis.org/publ/bcbs218.pdf.

test, including information about the types of models we use.7  We solicited comments on our 

design framework for scenarios in 2012, and incorporated into the final document some of the 

ideas we received--such as providing more information about the economic and financial 

conditions represented by paths of the variables in the scenarios.8  And this past spring, we 

published the additional set of stress test results that described how the firms would perform 

under the adverse scenario, in addition to the results of the severely adverse scenario, which we 

had previously released.9   

Because bank portfolios are often quite opaque and thus difficult for outsiders to value, 

this information should allow investors, counterparties, analysts, and markets more generally to 

make more informed judgments on the condition of U.S. banking institutions.  Coupled with 

other regulatory measures, this transparency should in turn increase market discipline.  This level 

of transparency also subjects us to greater outside scrutiny and analysis, a process that increases 

our accountability as regulators and helps us improve our assumptions and methodology over 

time.  These choices for greater transparency in the supervisory stress tests and CCAR have 

prompted healthy discussion on the merits of disclosure in other supervisory areas.   

As I think everyone in this audience knows, we have not disclosed the supervisory 

models themselves.  We do not want firms simply to copy our modeling in their own assessment 

of risks and capital needs.  And we certainly do not want them to construct their portfolios in an 

effort to game the model--a kind of analogue to teaching to a test.  But even though we do not 

publicly release the models, we have put systems in place to ensure oversight and accountability.

The models are evaluated by a special model validation group made up of experts within the 

Federal Reserve who do not work on the stress tests.  We have also created a Model Validation 

Council made up of outside experts to provide independent views and advice.10 

The third important effect of the supervisory stress tests and CCAR has been to pave the 

way for other horizontal, simultaneous supervisory exercises.  We created the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) in 2010 to implement an approach to supervision 

of systemically important firms that was better coordinated, more data-driven, and more focused 

on the largest institutions as a group.11  While CCAR includes a number of firms that are not in 

the LISCC portfolio, the stress tests and CCAR have been the proving ground for LISCC, and as 

the committee has evolved to administer these programs more efficiently, these exercises have 

shown the way to other horizontal supervisory exercises or assessments.  Some, like the newer 

Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, which focuses on assessing liquidity sufficiency 

and banks’ internal liquidity risk-management practices, are intended to be recurring.  Others are 

ad hoc efforts responsive to more episodic or transitory concerns.   

Fourth, and in some sense an extension of the prior point, CCAR in particular has defined 

an approach toward developing and maintaining better risk management within the banking 

organizations subject to these exercises.  Let me turn now address this topic in somewhat greater 

detail. 

Ensuring Strong Risk Management 

 Here again, the origins of our current program lie in our experience with the SCAP in 

2009, during which we learned a great deal beyond just post-stress loss and capital numbers.  

The horizontal, cross-firm nature of the exercise also allowed us to evaluate and compare the

effectiveness of the firms’ processes for determining and addressing their own capital needs.  We 

discovered that, at the time, many of the firms had critical deficiencies in the fundamental risk-

measurement and risk-management practices necessary to assess their capital needs.  Many firms 

did not have a systematic program for assessing their capital needs and even lacked the basic 

data on firm-wide risks and exposures needed to begin such a program.  Not surprisingly, there 

appeared to be a correlation between firms found to be insufficiently capitalized to withstand 

further financial and economic stress and firms lacking effective processes for assessing their 

risks and vulnerabilities.   

In response to these deficiencies, the Federal Reserve initiated the annual CCAR process 

for assessing the capital adequacy and internal capital planning processes of large, complex bank 

holding companies (BHCs).  CCAR is premised on the belief that thorough, rigorous risk 

management must underpin all the activities of all such firms.  Risks that are identified and 

understood can be evaluated and, where appropriate, assumed with proper safeguards and capital 

planning.  Risks that are overlooked, misunderstood, or taken outside of a well-considered and 

comprehensive risk-management framework plant the seeds for serious trouble for individual 

firms and potentially for the financial system.  Through CCAR, we have sought to ensure not 

only that all large BHCs have strong capital positions as determined through our supervisory 

stress test, but also that they have strong capital planning practices that are appropriately focused 

on the capital needed to withstand possible losses from the specific risks in each firm’s business 

model.  These processes, grounded in strong quantitative and qualitative risk management, also 

give supervisors a clearer window into each firm’s activities and thus increase the effectiveness 

of regular supervision. 


- 10 - 
 

Since the first CCAR there has been notable improvement in the firms’ capital planning 

processes.  Many firms have made meaningful investments in their risk-measurement processes, 

including significant enhancements to their internal data and management information systems.  

Many firms have adopted a formal framework to inform their capital planning through an 

analysis of their vulnerabilities and capital adequacy under a range of potential adverse 

scenarios.  They have also taken steps to enhance the integrity of their risk measures, analysis, 

and the decision-making around their capital levels and distributions. 

Despite these advances, there is continuing need for improvement in the firms’ capital 

planning processes.  Some firms still lack reliable information about their businesses and 

exposures.  Firms also are sometimes unable to measure or understand how stressful conditions 

can change the performance of their material business lines.  In particular, the capacity to assess 

the impact of tail risks remains in need of further development at many firms.  These deficiencies 

are, in some instances, compounded by weak oversight by senior management and boards of 

directors, and lack of effective checks and accountability in the process.   

The Qualitative Assessment in CCAR 

The importance we attach to these risk-management and capital planning processes is 

reflected in the component of CCAR known as the qualitative assessment.  This assessment 

covers a range of topics, including the extent to which the design of a firm’s internal scenario 

captures the specific risks from the firm’s activities, the firm’s methods for projecting losses 

under stress scenarios, and how the firm identifies appropriate capital levels and plans for 

distributions.  As detailed in our CCAR regulation, where these processes are found to be 

inadequate, or to raise safety and soundness concerns, they may form the basis for an objection 


- 11 - 
 

by the Board of Governors to the capital distribution plans of a firm.12  If a firm’s internal 

processes are unreliable, supervisors will necessarily be concerned that a firm may not properly 

have assessed risks clearly and, where needed, assured adequate capital for the many risks that 

cannot be fully captured by standardized stress tests. 

As the process and expectations for the quantitative test have become better understood, 

attention has shifted a bit to the qualitative assessment.  To place that part of the CCAR in 

context, let me make several additional points. 

First, as I have already noted, many firms had a long way to go to meet high standards of 

capital planning backed by strong risk management when we began CCAR.  Given that initial 

gap, we have allowed time for firms to work toward full achievement of those standards.  Thus, 

what may be perceived as a raising of the bar every year is better understood as our effort to 

provide a demanding, but still realistic, glide path for firms to reach that goal.  We do, however, 

expect firms to continue to make steady progress each year. 

Second, the horizontal nature of the qualitative assessment does not mean that every year 

one or more firms must receive an objection on qualitative grounds.  The comparative approach 

helps ensure that firms are evaluated consistently and fairly.  And it does allow us to see where 

specific firms may be outliers from good practices followed in the rest of the industry.  But this 

is not a PGA tournament--there is no foreordained cut that some participants will miss.   

Third, while there are minimum standards for all CCAR firms, the standards are more 

stringent for firms of greater systemic importance.13  It is not enough for the largest and most 

                                                 
12 See 12 CFR 225.8(e)(2)(ii).   
13 It is also worth emphasizing that both elements of CCAR--the qualitative and the quantitative assessments--only 
apply to BHCs with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies with 
between $10 and 50 billion in assets to conduct an annual company-run stress test.  The Federal Reserve does not 
conduct a CCAR-like exercise to evaluate these company-run stress tests, although we do review the firms’ 
 


- 12 - 
 

complex banking organizations to meet only the minimum standards in CCAR.  We expect the 

more systemically important firms to establish and maintain the most sophisticated risk-

management and capital planning practices.  Their risk management and capital adequacy should 

be sufficiently strong to help ensure their resiliency to a range of unexpected stress events, since 

their distress could pose a threat to the financial system and to the broader economy. 

Fourth, precisely because of its importance to our supervisory program, the qualitative 

assessment will continue to be progressively more integrated into year-round supervision of the 

CCAR firms.  While some important features of capital planning are observable only during the 

formal CCAR process, most of the risk-management and capital planning standards incorporated 

in CCAR are operative and observable by supervisors throughout the year.  These should be an 

important focus of ongoing supervisory oversight and of discussions between firms and 

supervisors.  Only in unusual circumstances should supervisors learn for the first time during 

CCAR of significant problems in the quality of the capital planning processes, and only in 

unusual circumstances should firms be surprised at the outcome of the qualitative assessment. 

We have already taken steps to further this integration of CCAR and regular supervision.  

At the end of each CCAR process our supervisors send to each firm a letter detailing their 

conclusions concerning the qualitative assessment.  To the extent weaknesses or areas for 

improvement are identified, those letters provide a basis for regular stocktaking by both firms 

and supervisors.  More generally, last year we released a paper on our expectations for all aspects 

                                                                                                                                                             
company-run stress tests and capital planning processes in the normal course of supervision.  This review is tailored 
to the smaller size, reduced complexity, and limited systemic risk of these firms. See footnote 5, p. 14160, of Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency (2014), “Supervisory Guidance on Implementing Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Tests for 
Banking Organizations with Total Consolidated Assets of More Than $10 Billion but Less Than $50 Billion,” final 
supervisory guidance (Docket No. OCC–2013–0013), Federal Register, vol. 79 (March 13), 
www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2014-03-13/pdf/2014-05518.pdf.  For other, smaller banking organizations--those with 
$10 billion or less in total consolidated assets--there is no supervisory expectation or regulatory requirement that 
these firms will conduct capital stress testing.

of capital planning, providing greater detail than what is included in the annual CCAR 

instructions.14   

I anticipate that we will take additional steps to integrate ongoing supervisory 

assessments of risk-management and other internal control processes with the annual CCAR 

exercise, and to assure that communications in both directions are heard.  One such step has just 

recently begun: The committee chaired by senior Board staff that is responsible for the oversight 

of CCAR, supported by the relevant horizontal assessment teams, will directly engage with firms 

during the course of the year to evaluate progress in remediating weaknesses or other issues 

identified in the post-CCAR letters.  Increasingly, our regular supervisory work on topics such as 

risk-identification and internal audit will focus on processes that are critical to risk management 

and capital planning at the firms, areas of focus for CCAR.  The aim of these and additional 

measures is to make CCAR more the culmination of year-round supervision of risk-management 

and capital planning processes than a discrete exercise that takes place at the same time as the 

supervisory stress tests. 

 Finally, I would note that, to provide investors, counterparties, analysts, and the public 

with better information on the meaning of an objection on qualitative grounds to a capital 

distribution plan, we now release our decisions on each capital plan and, for firms whose capital 

plans were objected to, provide a summary of the specific reasons for those objections.15 

Conclusion 

 Although strong capital regulation is critical to ensuring the safety and soundness of our 

largest financial institutions, it is not a panacea, as indeed no single regulatory device can ever

be.  Similarly, supervisory stress testing and CCAR, while central to ensuring strong capital 

positions for large firms, are not the only important elements of our supervisory program.  

Having said that, however, I hope you will take at least these three points away from my remarks 

today.   

First, supervisory stress testing has fundamentally changed the way we think about 

capital adequacy.  The need to specify scenarios, loss estimates, and revenue assumptions--and to 

apply these specifications on a dynamic basis--has immeasurably advanced the regulation of 

capital adequacy and, thus, the safety and soundness of our financial system.  The opportunities 

it provides to incorporate macroprudential elements make it, in my judgment, the single most 

important advance in prudential regulation since the crisis. 

Second, supervisory stress testing and CCAR have provided the first significant form of 

supervision conducted in a horizontal, coordinated fashion, affording a single view of an entire 

portfolio of institutions, as well as more data-rich insight into each institution individually.  As 

such, these programs have opened the way for similar supervisory activities and continue to 

teach us how to organize our supervisory efforts in order most effectively to safeguard firm 

soundness and financial stability. 

Finally, supervisory stress testing and CCAR are the exemplary cases of how supervision 

that aspires to keep up with the dynamism of financial firms and financial markets must itself be 

composed of adaptive tools.  If regulators are to make the necessary adaptations, they must be 

open to the comments, critiques, and suggestions of those outside the regulatory community.  For 

this reason, transparency around the aims, assumptions, and methodologies of stress testing and 

our review of capital plans must be preserved and extended.

With that point, I end where I began--by emphasizing the importance of forums such as 

this one, and thanking you for your participation.
