Housing Markets in Transition 





Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


2012 National Association of Home Builders International Builders’ Show 


Orlando, Florida 




February 10, 2012 




The economic recovery began more than two years ago, but it doesn’t feel like 

much of a recovery for many Americans--certainly for those of you who depend on the 

housing sector for your living, as well as for the millions of others who have seen their 

home values plummet or lost their homes through foreclosure.  Though some progress 

has been made in reversing the losses in jobs and income sustained during the recession, 

the pace of expansion has been frustratingly slow and the unemployment rate remains 

very high by historical standards.  The state of the housing sector has been a key 

impediment to a faster recovery.  In the typical economic recovery, a resurgent housing 

sector helps fuel reemployment and rising incomes.  But as you know all too well, that 

scenario has not played out this time.  Although the precipitous declines in construction 

that began in 2006 are, thankfully, now behind us, homebuilding remains depressed in 

most areas, relative both to where it was before the downturn and to where it will need to 

be to meet the needs of a growing population in the longer term.   

The Federal Reserve has a keen interest in the state of housing and has been 

actively engaged in analyzing the housing and mortgage markets.
1
  Issues related to the 

housing market and housing finance are important factors in the Federal Reserve’s 

various roles in formulating monetary policy, regulating banks, and protecting consumers 

of financial services.  Traditionally, mortgage interest rates have been a key transmission 

                                                 
1
 These remarks draw heavily on research conducted by Federal Reserve staff, including work presented in 

the white paper on the U.S. housing market that was transmitted to the Congress in January (see Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “The U.S. Housing Market:  Current Conditions and 

Policy Considerations,” white paper  (Washington:  Board of Governors, January), 

http://federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/files/housing-white-paper-20120104.pdf) and in a 

publication on real estate owned and vacant properties (see Federal Reserve Banks of Boston and 

Cleveland and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), REO and Vacant Properties:  

Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization, report (Washington:  Board of Governors, September),

channel of monetary policy; and banks’ mortgage lending policies directly affect their 

own safety and soundness as well as the access of creditworthy households to mortgage 

credit.  My remarks today will focus on current housing market conditions and on how 

housing problems have affected borrowers, lenders, communities, and the broader 

economy.  I’ll also discuss some specific sources of our housing problems, including 

tight conditions in the mortgage market and the overhang of foreclosed and vacant 

homes. 

Overview of the State of the Housing Market 

One way to understand conditions in the housing market is to focus on the balance 

of supply and demand.  For the past few years, the actual and potential supply of single-

family homes has greatly exceeded the effective demand.  The elevated number of homes 

that are currently vacant instead of owner occupied reflects the imbalance.  According to 

the most recent estimate, about 1-3/4 million homes are currently unoccupied and for 

sale.  While this figure has declined slightly during the past few years, it is nonetheless up 

dramatically from the first half of the 2000s, when readings of about 1-1/4 million vacant 

homes were the norm.  Of course, housing conditions vary by region, and vacancy rates 

in some locations are substantially higher than the national average.  For example, here in 

Florida the homeowner vacancy rate in the third quarter of 2011 averaged 3.2 percent, 

compared with the national average of 2.4 percent.
2
   

Moreover, a very large number of additional homes are poised to come on the 

owner-occupied market.  In each of the past few years, roughly 2 million homes have 

entered the foreclosure process, and many of these homes have been put up for sale,

crowding out much of the need for new building.  Looking ahead, the relatively high rate 

of foreclosures is likely to continue for a while, putting additional homes on the market 

and dislocating families and disrupting communities in the process. 

At the same time, a number of factors are constraining demand.  Household 

formation has been down, particularly among young adults.  High unemployment and 

uncertain job prospects may have reduced the willingness of some households to commit 

to homeownership.  Availability of mortgage credit is an important constraint, to which I 

will return later.  Additionally, housing may no longer be viewed as the secure 

investment it once was thought to be, given uncertainty about future home prices and the 

economy more generally.   

Not surprisingly, the large imbalance of supply and demand has been reflected in 

a drop in home values of historic proportions.  Nationally, house prices have plunged 

about 30 percent in nominal terms from their peak and nearly 40 percent in real, or 

inflation-adjusted, terms.  The imbalance of supply and demand has also been reflected in 

the decline in home construction that I mentioned earlier.  Since 2009, the pace of single-

family housing starts has averaged less than 500,000 units per year.  During the 15 years 

before the financial crisis, the pace of single-family starts had never fallen below 

1 million units per year. 

In contrast to the situation for owner-occupied homes, rental markets around the 

country have strengthened somewhat.  In particular, vacancy rates for rental properties 

have declined and now stand near the lower end of their range over the past eight years.  

Not surprisingly, rents have been increasing and the construction of apartment buildings 

has picked up.

To recap, the housing sector continues to suffer from serious imbalances--a 

marked excess supply for owner-occupied housing accompanied by a stronger rental 

markets.  The narrative of the housing market over the next several years will revolve 

around the resolution of those imbalances.      

Broader Implications of the Problems in the Housing Market  

As homebuilders, you naturally pay close attention to the demand for new homes 

and their prices.  These factors are important for the health of your industry, including its 

ability to create jobs in construction and related activities.  But the problems in housing 

also have important implications outside the construction industry. 

For instance, consider the effects on neighborhoods and communities.  

Foreclosures, particularly when they are geographically concentrated, can diminish the 

values of nearby properties.
 3

  Many foreclosed homes are neglected or abandoned, as 

legal proceedings or other factors delay their resale.  Deteriorating or vacant properties 

can, in turn, directly affect the quality of life in a neighborhood, for example, by leading 

to increases in vandalism or crime.  Moreover, the continuing price declines typical in 

neighborhoods with many foreclosures depress the tax base of the community.  A vicious 

circle can get started:  Increasing vacancies together with decreasing tax revenue and 

consequent cutbacks in services can further depress home prices, putting the goal of 

neighborhood stabilization even further out of reach.

As I mentioned earlier, problems in the housing market have also restrained the 

broader economic recovery.  For example, by some estimates, declines in house prices 

have reduced homeowners’ equity by more than 50 percent in the aggregate since the 

peak of the housing boom, resulting in more than a $7 trillion loss of household wealth.
4
  

Indeed, about 12 million homeowners--more than 1 out of 5 with a mortgage--are 

underwater, meaning they owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth.  One 

of the effects of declines in housing wealth is to reduce the ability and willingness of 

households to spend.  While estimates vary, homeowners are believed to spend 

somewhere between $3 and $5 per year less for every $100 of housing value lost.
5
  Based 

on those estimates, it appears that recent declines in housing wealth may be reducing 

consumer spending between $200 billion and $375 billion per year.  That reduction 

corresponds to lower living standards for many Americans.  And, importantly, lower 

sales of goods and services also reduce the incentives of firms to invest and hire, thereby 

slowing the recovery.  Of course, these consumer-related effects are on top of the direct 

consequences of low rates of home construction for job creation and income. 

 Low or negative equity creates additional problems for households.  It reduces 

financial flexibility:  Homeowners who are underwater on their mortgages cannot tap

home equity to pay for emergency health expenses or their children’s college educations.  

Mobility may be affected to some degree; underwater borrowers who have difficulty 

selling their homes may find it more difficult to move to take new jobs.  Moreover, 

homeowners with underwater mortgages may find it difficult or impossible to take 

advantage of low interest rates by refinancing their mortgages, even if they are current on 

their payments.
6
   

The state of housing and mortgage markets may also be holding back the recovery 

of our financial system and the normalization of credit conditions.  Mortgage 

delinquencies surged between 2007 and 2009 and remain high, imposing losses on 

lenders, mortgage insurers, and investors.  Although some of the losses were the result of 

poorly underwritten mortgages, an increasing share of losses have arisen from prime 

mortgages that were originally fully documented with significant down payments, but 

that have defaulted due to the weak economy and housing market.  The Federal Reserve 

and other bank regulators have used stress tests and other tools to help ensure that banks 

have enough capital to cover mortgage losses while continuing to lend.  On the margin, 

though, some lenders might be inclined to respond to losses by tightening credit terms or 

being more cautious about extending loans rather than by raising additional capital.

 The effect of bank capital on lending is a critical determinant of the linkage between financial conditions 

and real activity, and has received special attention in the recent financial crisis.  Modest effects of bank 

capital ratio changes on lending are reported in Jose M. Berrospide and Rochelle M. Edge (2010), “The 

Effects of Bank Capital on Lending:  What Do We Know, and What Does It Mean?”  International Journal 

of Central Banking, vol. 6 (December), pp. 5-54.

short, housing problems affect the homebuilding industry, of course, but also have much 

broader effects--on neighborhoods and communities, on homeowners, on the financial 

system, and on the vitality of the economy as a whole.  This observation underscores the 

importance of efforts to improve the condition of the housing market. 

Availability of Mortgage Credit    

So why has the recovery in housing been so slow?  One important factor is 

restraints on mortgage credit.  Since its peak in 2007, U.S. home mortgage credit 

outstanding has contracted about 13 percent in real terms.  In prior recoveries, mortgage 

credit had begun to grow four years after the business cycle peak--but not this time 

around.
8
   

One reason for the very slow recovery in mortgage credit, despite monetary 

policy actions that have helped drive mortgage rates to historically low levels, is that 

many lending institutions have tightened underwriting conditions dramatically, relative to 

the pre-recession period.
9
  Given the lax standards during the credit boom, some 

tightening was doubtless appropriate to protect consumers and ensure lenders’ safety and 

soundness.  However, current lending practices appear to reflect, in part, obstacles that 

are limiting or preventing lending even to creditworthy households.

nonfinancial business credit--around business cycle peaks since 1952, see Diana Hancock and Rochelle M.

 For example, bank responses to the Federal Reserve Board’s quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion 

Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicate net tightening in lending standards for mortgage originated 

from 2007 through 2009.  Surveys since then have yet to provide evidence of unwinding that tightness even 

for prime mortgages that can be backed by guarantees from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the Federal 

Housing Administration.

For example, mortgage originators appear to be reluctant to extend credit to some 

potential borrowers who could meet the underwriting standards currently set by the 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).  Indeed, fewer than half of lenders are 

offering mortgages to borrowers with a FICO score of 620 and a down payment of 

10 percent, even though such loans could be within the GSE purchase parameters.
10

  A 

number of possibilities could explain this reluctance to lend.  In some cases, borrowers 

cannot obtain private mortgage insurance required by the GSEs.  Thus, the weakened 

finances of private mortgage insurers could be damping mortgage credit availability for 

some potential borrowers.  In other cases, lenders may be concerned about high servicing 

costs if mortgages become delinquent.  Another set of concerns relates to so-called 

representations and warranties, which are contractual commitments by an originator 

concerning the quality of the loan.  These contracts were designed to protect the GSEs or 

other purchasers of loans, but originators appear uncertain about how they will be 

enforced going forward and thus have been very cautious about making loans that could 

be viewed as less than perfect from an underwriting perspective.  Learning from our 

experience with securitizations over the past decade, lenders and regulators alike should 

look carefully at rules and practices that may unduly diminish the origination of 

prudently underwritten mortgages. 

Another reason for tight lending standards is that private-label mortgage 

securitizations have virtually disappeared.  The difficulty of funding loans in the private-

label securitization market may have discouraged lenders from originating loans to some 

                                                 
10

 FICO scores are based on information that a credit bureau (for example, Experian, TransUnion, and 

Equifax) keeps on an individual.  The higher the score, which ranges from 300 to 850, the lower the credit 

risk.  Credit scores are used to inform lenders when they assess an individual’s credit risk.  See Board of 

Governors, “The U.S. Housing Market,” p. 6 (see note 1).

borrowers who may be creditworthy but may not exactly fit the criteria of the GSEs or 

the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). 

Potential first-time homebuyers have been disproportionately affected by the very 

tight conditions in mortgage markets.  Lending to potential first-time homebuyers has 

dropped precipitously, even in parts of the country where unemployment rates and 

housing conditions are better than the national average.  Indeed, the propensity of 

younger households--headed by adults aged 29 to 34--to take out their first mortgage has 

been much lower recently than it was 10 years ago, a period well before the most recent 

run-up in home prices.
11

  First-time homebuyers are typically an important source of 

incremental housing demand, so their smaller presence in the market affects house prices 

and construction quite broadly.
12

  Moreover, the lack of demand from first-time 

homebuyers may prevent current homeowners from moving up to larger homes, for 

example, to accommodate growing families.      

An additional issue is the implication of tight mortgage credit conditions for 

monetary policy.  Because some creditworthy households are finding it difficult to obtain 

mortgage credit or to refinance, the strong actions taken by the Federal Reserve to put 

downward pressure on longer-term rates and to improve financial conditions have had 

less effect on the housing sector and overall economic activity than they otherwise would 

have had.  

                                                 
11

 For example, consumer credit record data show that the share of 29- to 34-year-olds obtaining their first 

mortgage was significantly lower in the past two years (mid-2009 to mid-2011) at 9 percent than it was 

10 years earlier (mid-1999 to mid-2011) at 17 percent.

(Washington:  HUD, November), available at www.huduser.org/periodicals/ushmc/fall2001/index.html.

The problem of tight mortgage credit will not be solved easily or quickly.  The 

Federal Reserve, in its supervisory capacity, continues to encourage lenders to find ways 

to maintain prudent lending standards while serving creditworthy borrowers.  But the 

slow recovery of the housing market and the economy, continued uncertainty surrounding 

the future of the GSEs and the regulatory environment for mortgage lending, the likely 

continued absence of a private-label market, and more cautious attitudes by lenders are 

all barriers to rapid normalization of the flow of mortgage credit.  

Overhang of Empty and Foreclosed Homes 

To date, policymakers have been focusing on refinancing creditworthy (but 

sometimes underwater) borrowers, on loan modifications, and on other ways to avert 

additional foreclosures.  This work is obviously very important.  But unfortunately, not 

all foreclosures can be prevented.  Given the weak economy and high unemployment 

rates, some borrowers simply do not have the wherewithal to meet monthly mortgage 

payments even if their loans were to be substantially modified.  Therefore, we have seen 

increased interest in whether anything can be done to reduce the overhang of empty and 

foreclosed homes.
13


We estimate that about one-fourth of the excess supply of vacant homes for sale 

in the second quarter of 2011 was owned by creditors; these homes are often referred to 

as real estate owned, or REO properties.
14

  Moreover, Federal Reserve staff estimate that 

distressed sales, which include both short sales and non-auction sales of foreclosed 

                                                 
13

 For a discussion of some of the tradeoffs that policymakers might take into account in considering 

whether to expand these efforts to reduce the overhang of empty and foreclosed homes further, see Board 

of Governors, “The U.S. Housing Market” (see note 1). 
14

 The inventory of REO for sale is roughly 140,000 units above its 2004 level, while the inventory of 

vacant homes for sale is roughly 600,000 units above its 2004 level, per Federal Reserve staff calculations 

based on data from CoreLogic and the Housing Vacancy Survey. 


- 11 - 




homes by REO holders, now account for 30 percent of home sales.  Although it is 

difficult to forecast future REO flows, we estimate that an additional 1 million foreclosed 

properties could be added to the REO held by banks, guarantors, and servicers in each of 

the next few years.  These inflows will continue to exert downward pressure on home 

prices.    

In contrast to the markets for owner-occupied homes, rental housing markets 

across the nation have recently strengthened somewhat, as I mentioned earlier.  Fueled by 

increased demand from families who are either unable or reluctant to purchase homes, 

rents are up and vacancy rates for multifamily properties are down in most metropolitan 

areas.     

With home prices falling and rents rising, it could make sense in some markets to 

turn some of the foreclosed homes into rental properties.  According to Federal Reserve 

staff calculations, most REO properties are in neighborhoods with median house values 

and incomes that are roughly similar to the medians for the metropolitan area overall.
15


Moreover, these properties are not unusually far, in terms of commuting times, from 

where jobs are located.
16

  We have compared computations of the expected annual cash 

flows from renting properties to the discounted prices that REO property holders 

typically receive when selling a home.  The comparison suggests that some REO holders 

might come out ahead by renting, rather than by selling, some of their properties.   

                                                 
15

 More precisely, Federal Reserve staff estimate that about 75 percent of REO properties are in 

neighborhoods where the median house values and incomes are greater than 80 percent of the medians for 

the metropolitan area. 
16

 Data on median home values, income, and commute times are from the 2000 census, available on the 

U.S. Census Bureau website at www.census.gov/main/www/cen2000.html. 


- 12 - 




Moreover, keeping paying tenants in homes--including leasing to the former 

owners at market rents--may, in some cases, be the best way to maintain property values 

and the quality of neighborhoods.  REO-to-rental programs could potentially also 

minimize the amount of time that a vacant property languishes in REO inventory.  That 

is, appropriately structured programs could help some involuntary renters become owners 

again by giving them options to purchase the homes they are renting.   

REO-to-rental programs are not a “silver bullet” for the housing market, and, 

indeed, implementing them presents some challenges.  For example, selling the properties 

in bulk to investors to rent out has proven difficult at times because of lack of financing, 

although the GSEs have just announced a pilot program to facilitate such purchases.  In 

addition, many REO properties may not be appropriate for REO-to-rental programs, 

either because they are in very poor condition or because they are not part of a 

sufficiently large cluster of properties to allow for economies of scale in their 

management. 

Nevertheless, REO-to-rental programs appear to have some potential for success.  

As of early November 2011, about 60 metropolitan areas each had at least 250 REO 

properties for sale by the GSEs and the FHA--a scale that could be large enough to 

realize efficiency gains.
17

  Atlanta has the largest number of REO properties for sale by 

these institutions, with about 5,000 units.  The next-largest inventories are in the 

metropolitan areas of Chicago; Detroit; Phoenix; Riverside, California; and Las Vegas, 

                                                 
17  

Federal Reserve staff calculations from data on the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s 

Real-Estate Owned Properties Portal, available at www.huduser.org/reo/reo.html.  Recently, only around 

half of the properties in the REO inventories of the GSEs have been offered for sale at any given point.  

The other properties are leased to existing tenants under the provisions of the Protecting Tenants at 

Foreclosure Act, are located in states with a redemption period after foreclosure, or are under renovation or 

otherwise unavailable for sale. 


- 13 - 




each of which have between 2,000 and 3,000 units.  As I noted, not all REO properties 

are appropriate for rental, but many do appear to be physically adequate and potentially 

attractive to tenants.  The number of properties suitable for rental is bound to increase, as 

the number of properties currently in the foreclosure process is more than four times the 

number of properties in the REO inventory. 

Other options can help with foreclosed houses that have low value and are in poor 

condition, homes that are not likely to be dealt with adequately through the private 

market.  For example, land banks could handle some of these properties.  Land banks are 

typically governmental entities that have the ability to purchase and sell real estate, clear 

titles, and accept donated properties.  Properties may be rehabilitated as rental or owner-

occupied housing or, in extreme cases, demolished, depending on the needs of individual 

markets.  While land banks are a promising option, only some states have passed 

legislation to establish land banks, and most existing land banks lack the resources to 

keep pace with the number of low-value properties in the current inventory.  It is, of 

course, critical that local governments pursuing land banking, or similar strategies, have 

staff members with the appropriate skills as well as adequate oversight to ensure that 

public funds are employed efficiently.  

REO-to-rental programs, land banks, and other neighborhood stabilization efforts 

are just a few examples of the approaches that policymakers could consider to help 

facilitate the adjustment of the housing market.
18

  To be sure, every program requires 

                                                 
18

 Other potential approaches include loan modification programs, principal reduction protocols, and the 

use of short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure.  Such approaches are discussed in Board of Governors, 

“The U.S. Housing Market” (see note 1).

careful analysis to ensure that it is effective and meets reasonable cost-benefit tests.  

Experimentation with alternative approaches could help find the best way forward.  

Conclusion  

In sum, the economic recovery has been disappointing in part because U.S. 

housing markets remain out of balance.  Many local markets have an overhang of empty 

and foreclosed homes, and many potentially creditworthy homebuyers cannot obtain 

mortgages.  The weak housing market also impairs homeowners’ financial health and 

diminishes the quality and stability of neighborhoods and communities.  For these 

reasons, and because the troubled housing market depresses construction activity and 

employment, we need to continue to develop and implement policies that will help the 

housing sector get back on its feet.  No single solution will be sufficient.  But sustained 

efforts to address the many interlocking factors holding back the housing market will pay 

dividends in the long run.
