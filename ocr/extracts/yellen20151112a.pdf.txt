It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve Board’s conference on 

“Monetary Policy Implementation and Transmission in the Post-Crisis Period.”  The 

conference aims to bring together academic and central bank economists, financial 

market practitioners, and policymakers to stimulate debate and research on a topic that is 

critically important to the Federal Reserve’s mission of conducting monetary policy in 

the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices.  

The global financial crisis had profound effects on our economy, and it altered the 

way many think about monetary policy.  At the peak of the crisis and during its 

immediate aftermath, unconventional monetary policy measures were designed and 

implemented by the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world.  The post-

crisis period has offered policymakers an opportunity to assess a range of novel policy 

and operational issues associated with the conduct of monetary policy and the 

effectiveness of different policy options.  Specifically, policymakers have to carefully 

weigh the advantages and disadvantages of alternative monetary implementation 

frameworks in the presence of new policy tools.  Moreover, policymakers should be 

mindful of new channels for monetary policy transmission that may have emerged from 

the intricate economic and financial linkages in our global economy that were revealed 

by the crisis.  Finally, it is crucial to understand the effect of regulations and possible 

changes in financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and transmission. 

The impressive conference program covers the following topics in three sessions:  

monetary policy implementation, the transmission of monetary policy, and the effect of 

regulation and financial intermediation on monetary policy implementation and 

transmission.  The presentations and discussions of the 12 academic papers on the 


 - 2 - 

conference program will surely provide a foundation for what I expect will be a 

stimulating discussion of important topics over the next two days.  

Looking ahead to later today, I am delighted that Vice Chairman Fischer will 

deliver keynote remarks on the exchange rate mechanism in the transmission of monetary 

policy.  Tomorrow the conference concludes with two interesting policy panels on the 

effect of regulations on monetary policy and the “optimal design” of monetary policy in 

the post-crisis world. 

Let me also say that I consider the topics covered during this conference highly 

relevant for the Federal Reserve System’s ongoing efforts to evaluate potential long-run 

monetary policy implementation frameworks and to assess a number of issues related to 

the consideration of alternative frameworks.  I hope the work and ideas presented and 

discussed over the next two days will spur subsequent research on these issues and 

promote further collaboration among all of you.  

As I have often stressed before, in addition to its responsibilities for monetary 

policy and financial regulation and supervision, the Federal Reserve takes very seriously 

its role as a research institution.  I want to thank our research conference committee for 

putting together this high-caliber research conference, which has gathered distinguished 

speakers and guests from around the world and, I am sure, will add to our understanding 

of the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.   

Welcome to the Federal Reserve Board.  I hope you all have enjoyable and 

productive discussions over the next two days.
