 It is a pleasure for me to return to the Center for Pacific Basin Studies here at the San 

Francisco Fed.  The global economy is at a critical juncture today.  According to the 

International Monetary Fund’s latest World Economic Outlook, global gross domestic product 

(GDP) is set to grow at only 3.1 percent this year, the lowest rate of growth since the Global 

Financial Crisis.  Investment and productivity remain subdued, despite extremely low and even 

negative interest rates in many economies.1  One key aspect of global weakness that is of 

particular relevance to emerging Asian economies is the sharp slowdown in global trade.  This 

slowdown represents a notable departure from the “normal” times of the past few decades, and is 

the subject of my remarks today.2   

More specifically, I will discuss four topics.  First, I will review the main features of the 

global trade slowdown and summarize the evidence on its potential causes.  Second, I will 

examine the special role that structural changes in China appear to be playing in the trade 

slowdown.  Third, I will turn to the implications of this slowdown for economic growth in the 

region.  And, finally, I will offer some views on how Asian economies can respond to the 

slowdown by rethinking their “export-led growth” paradigm.   


1 The World Economic Outlook’s headline growth numbers aggregate global growth, using PPP-based GDP weights.  
They also compute growth using GDP weights based on market exchange rates, according to which global growth 
this year is projected to be even lower, at 2.4 percent.   
2 The views I express here are my own.

Documenting the Global Trade Slowdown and Its Likely Causes 

To set the scene, I will review the main features of the recent global trade slowdown.  As 

you can see on the first slide, growth in world trade rebounded after the Great Recession but has 

slowed substantially since 2011.  On a real inflation-adjusted basis, world imports have grown at 

an average annual rate of less than 3-1/2 percent since 2011, about half the 7 percent pace seen in 

the eight years prior to the Global Financial Crisis.3  As illustrated in the next slide, trade is no 

longer outpacing GDP growth.  The share of real world imports in world GDP has been flat at 

just under 30 percent since 2011 after nearly doubling between 1985 and 2007.4  This sustained 

slowing of real trade relative to GDP is quite unusual:  Since 1870, trade has generally grown 

faster than production, outside of wartime and recessionary periods.   

Trade has been sluggish almost everywhere.  Real trade growth has been lower over the 

2011-15 period compared with the 2000-07 period for every G-20 country outside of Japan, 

where trade growth was constant.  The third slide shows that the fall in real import growth in 

emerging Asia has been particularly pronounced from over 10 percent in the first period to just 

about 3 percent in the second.  But import growth has declined in Latin America and the 

advanced economies as well.  

The next slide shows the differential between real import growth and real GDP growth 

for the same two periods.  For emerging Asia, the differential went from positive to substantially 

negative, indicating that real import growth slowed to well below real GDP growth.  In advanced 


3 In principle, data on either world exports or world imports could be used to study global trade, though the two 
differ in practice.  My remarks here focus on import data, which are generally regarded as more reliable at the 
country level.

sharp drop in 2015, reflecting steep declines in commodity prices.

foreign economies, the differential was just about zero in the more recent period, indicating that 

real import growth barely kept pace with GDP growth.  Trade relative to GDP has held up better, 

though, in the United States and Latin America.      

Is the trade slowdown just another manifestation of slow growth, or is it an independent 

concern?  That depends on the reasons for the slowdown.  Weak global growth is surely part of 

the explanation, as emphasized by several recent empirical studies, including a special chapter on 

the topic in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook.5  As can be seen in slide 5, global GDP 

growth has fallen from an average of 3.5 percent before the Global Financial Crisis to about 

2.5 percent since its end.   

But weak global growth alone does not explain why trade has slowed to about the same 

pace as GDP after growing faster than GDP for decades.  Part of the reason could be that the 

particular expenditure categories in which international trade flows are concentrated have 

become especially weak.  A stark case in point is the Global Financial Crisis, when plummeting 

demand for investment and durable goods--two highly traded expenditure categories--

contributed to the sharp 4 percentage point fall in the ratio of world trade to GDP.  The special 

weakness in some components of demand has persisted beyond the crisis and could also explain 

some of the recent sluggishness in trade relative to GDP.  In particular, as you can see from the 

middle two bars of slide 5, the slowdown in world investment growth--from about 4.5 percent 

growth before the Global Financial Crisis to only about 3 percent growth since 2011--has been

European Central Bank (2016), and Hoekman (2015).

more pronounced than the slowdown in world GDP growth or in world consumption.  But the 

differences are not huge, suggesting that this explanation can go only so far.   

Indeed, research suggests that other factors are also important in accounting for the 

slowdown in world trade.6  One such factor is the deceleration in the pace of trade liberalization 

policies.  From the early 1990s through the mid-2000s, trade barriers were coming down rapidly, 

including the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the 2001 entry of 

China into the World Trade Organization, and the 2005 expiration of the multifibre agreement 

restricting textile imports to the United States and European Union.  These changes resulted in 

the most rapid increases in the trade-to-GDP ratio since 1870.  As the pace of trade liberalization 

has slowed in recent years, perhaps reflecting limits to further gains from trade agreements, it is 

only natural that the trade-to-GDP ratio should flatten out as well.   

Another related factor is the maturation of global value chains.  Increased fragmentation 

of production across international borders--a natural outgrowth of the gains from specialization--

meant more trade for any given value of final production, thus adding to the major expansion in 

gross trade flows in the 1990s and 2000s.  As shown in the next slide, global value chain 

participation, as measured by the share of foreign value added in world exports, increased 

substantially during this period.  It is quite plausible that the process of increased fragmentation 

of production across borders is subject to “diminishing returns” and has its natural limits.  

Consistent with this notion, the trend toward greater product fragmentation has slowed in recent 

years.    


6 See, for example, European Central Bank (2016), Hoekman (2015), Organization for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (2016), and Lewis and Monarch (2016).

Finally, of course, China looms large in any discussion of the global trade slowdown.   

Not only is China’s trade being affected by all of the factors just discussed, but on-going 

structural changes within the Chinese economy, including rebalancing toward domestic demand, 

are exerting an independent effect on world trade flows.  So, let’s look next at China in more 

detail.7 

China 

After years of rapid export-led growth, China is now among the world’s leaders in both 

exports and imports.  China’s exports now account for 14 percent of the world’s total, compared 

with only 4 percent 15 years ago.  At the same time, China’s industrialization and export model 

has greatly increased its own demand for imports of raw materials, intermediate inputs, and parts 

and components.  In recent years, however, growth in both Chinese imports and Chinese exports 

has slowed markedly.  These developments have had a significant effect on global trade.  One 

simple way to measure that effect is to consider what would have happened if China’s trade had 

not decelerated.  As shown in slide 7, under a counterfactual in which China’s trade growth had 

not slowed relative to its GDP since 2011, global trade would still be growing as a share of 

GDP.8 


7 Another explanation that has been put forward for much of the decline in world trade relative to world GDP is an 
increased weight of EMEs in the contribution to global growth together with the property that EMEs have lower 
income elasticities of trade than advanced economies do. (See European Central Bank, 2016.)  However, more 
broadly, the literature does not seem to suggest that income elasticities are significantly lower for EMEs (for 
example, Lui and others, 2013).  Also, while trade financing constraints—another potential explanation—played 
some role during the severe trade slowdown during the Global Financial Crisis, trade financing does not appear to 
have become more difficult since 2011 and likely has not been a significant factor in the slowdown in recent years.    
8 See Lewis and Monarch (2016) for more details.

China has, of course, been subject to many of the forces I have already discussed.  One 

notable trend, shown by the black line in slide 8, is that Chinese processing exports--that is, re-

exports from assembled imported parts and components--as a share of China’s total exports have 

been falling steadily for several years.  This trend in part reflects weak global demand, as weaker 

demand for final goods and services from the advanced economies should have led Chinese 

processing exports to fall disproportionately.  It is also consistent with the deceleration of global 

supply chain formation.   

Although global factors have undoubtedly played a role, however, the evidence suggests 

that a substantial part of the slowdown in Chinese trade reflects developments that are specific to 

the Chinese economy and that are likely to exert a lasting imprint on global trade.9  First, the 

rapid expansion of China’s manufacturing base over the past 15 years--made possible by vast 

reserves of cheap, rural labor--may simply be reaching its natural limit.  Accordingly, we would 

expect China’s manufacturing exports to slow. 

Second, China is moving up the sophistication ladder by producing some higher value-

added parts and components itself, instead of importing them.  One manifestation of this 

phenomenon is the higher domestic value-added in Chinese exports in recent years, shown by the 

gray bars in this slide, relative to the period before the Global Financial Crisis.  Another 

manifestation can be seen in slide 9, which shows the decline in the share of parts and 


9 A recent note from the Banque du France--Gaullier, Steingress, and Zignago (2016)--argues that the long run 
elasticity of world trade to income is unity, and that structural changes in China go a long way in explaining both the 
sharp rise in the elasticity in the years before the Global Financial Crisis and the subsequent decline in the post-crisis 
years as China rebalances toward domestic demand.

components in China’s total manufactured imports from about 65 percent in 2005 to under 

50 percent in 2014.10  These two pieces of evidence suggest that the shift away from parts and 

components in Chinese imports is not just due to lower orders tied to weak import demand in the 

advanced economies, but also due to the rising productivity and sophistication of the Chinese 

labor force, which is enabling China to move to higher value-added exports.   

As China moves up the sophistication ladder, you would also expect other countries to 

take a greater role in the lower steps of the ladder.  We do have evidence that some other 

countries with cheaper labor, such as Vietnam and Bangladesh, are playing more of a role as 

exporters in the low-value added parts of the Asian supply chain.  Anecdotal evidence suggests, 

though, that some of this shift is also taking place within China, as low-value-added production 

shifts to low-wage areas in China’s interior.11     

The third important structural change affecting Chinese trade is the progress China is 

making in moving away from its export-led model of economic growth and rebalancing its 

economy toward domestic demand.  As shown in slide 10, investment, which in much of the 

pre-crisis period was supporting high exports, has been falling as a share of the economy in 

recent years while the consumption share has been rising.  Note, though, that the consumption 

share remains well below its value in the early 2000s.  In addition, as can be seen in slide 11, as 

part of its rebalancing, Chinese production has been shifting away from manufacturing to 


10 This share has been computed by updating the methodology followed in Haltmaier and others (2007), which, in 
turn, extended the methodology of Athukorala and Yamashita (2006).  
11 See, for example, The Economist (2015).

services.  Thanks in part to these developments, China’s current account surplus (not shown 

here) has fallen sharply as a share of its GDP over the past several years.12   

These are welcome developments as China’s huge trade surplus created an unsustainable 

situation, contributing both to internal imbalances within the Chinese economy and to global 

imbalances.  But the rebalancing toward domestic demand will likely put a damper on China’s 

trade for some time as resources shift away from trade-intensive manufacturing.  In principle, 

this drag on China’s trade could be partly or even completely offset by stronger imports by 

Chinese consumers.  Evidence of a shift toward imports of consumer goods, however, is limited 

thus far, and further substantial progress depends on the Chinese authorities’ ability to remove 

distortions that currently depress consumption and boost saving.  It may well be, however, that 

the rising power of the Chinese consumer will in time propel another long round of rapid 

increases in world trade.   

Implications for Growth in the Region 

Having examined developments in world and Chinese trade, let me turn to the 

implications of these trends for economic growth in the emerging Asia region.   

There is little doubt that for many years China and other emerging Asian economies have 

benefited from rapid expansion of trade.13  Greater trade can provide a host of economic benefits, 

including enabling the pursuit of comparative advantage, fostering more competition (which 

leads to more efficiency), generating technological and knowledge spillovers, and facilitating 


12 Over the past couple of years, though, China’s current account surplus has turned up again, especially as a share 
of world GDP.  
13 See, for example, Glick and Moreno (1997), Page (1994), and World Bank (1993).

import of key capital goods.  These factors enhance productivity and growth and result in the 

availability of a greater variety of goods to consumers at lower prices.  It is safe to say that over 

the years, the Asian economies have benefited from their high degree of export orientation 

through all of these transmission mechanisms.14 A number of academic studies have found a 

causal link between openness and growth.15  A simple scatter plot of economic growth across 

countries over the period from 2000 to 2007 against their export orientation, presented in 

slide 12, is telling: More trade-intensive economies have grown significantly faster over this 

period, and the fast-growing emerging Asian economies shown by the red dots have generally 

been among the most export-oriented.   

How did greater focus on trade develop in Asia?  At first, increased export orientation in 

Asia was achieved by taking advantage of low-cost, low-skilled labor to produce low value-

added products for foreign markets.  Over time, countries such as Japan and South Korea moved 

up to higher value-added exports, in part through technological and knowledge spillovers.  Later, 

with the rise of China, many emerging Asian economies became integrated into global supply 

chains, with China acting as the endpoint of a giant Asian assembly line.  

Given that trade benefited the Asian economies on the way up, it seems natural that the 

slowdown in global trade, whatever its causes, could lead to some loss of dynamism and growth 

in the region.  For China, the shift away from trade dependence is partly a reflection of policy 

choice, with rebalancing seen as a way to sustain growth in the face of some exhaustion of the 


14 Some--Page (1994), for example--have argued that industrial policies favoring certain export industries have also 
played an important role in Asia’s success, but it seems to be generally agreed that industrial support was only 
maintained conditional on successful performance on world markets.   
15 See, for example, Frankel and Romer (1999) and Baldwin (2004).   


-11- 




heavy export/investment model.  But many other Asian economies’ fortunes are tied to those of 

China, so developments in China will have important implications for growth in these 

economies.  

One natural question is how the rise in domestic content of Chinese exports is affecting 

countries that rely heavily on supplying parts and components to China.  To document this 

reliance, your next slide shows that the share of parts and components in other Asian economies’ 

exports to China (the middle green bars) is much greater than their share in exports to the rest of 

the world (the right blue bars).  Over time, this share has fallen from about 70 percent in 2005 to 

60 percent in 2014, without the share of parts and components in exports to the rest of the world 

increasing.  This evidence, combined with the evidence I presented earlier on trends in Chinese 

processing exports, suggests that other economies in Asia are being adversely affected both by 

less final global demand for Chinese exports and by less use of imported parts and components 

by China in the production of any given amount of final goods exports.  

And the effects of these shifts in supply chains are being offset only very slowly and to 

only a very limited extent by China importing more goods for domestic consumption.16  

Accordingly, it is doubtful that, at least so far, China is fully replacing advanced-economy 

demand as an engine of growth for the rest of emerging Asia.  One way to look more concretely 

at this issue is to estimate an equation for the growth for emerging Asia ex. China that separately 

controls for the effects of Chinese growth and advanced-economy growth.  This approach lets us 


16 The arguments laid out here are consistent with the findings in the chapter on spillovers from China’s transition 
presented in the latest IMF World Economic Outlook (2016b).  This chapter concludes that for many countries the 
effect of China’s transition and rebalancing toward a more sustainable growth model will entail short-run negative 
spillovers, but there will be potential gains to the global economy over the longer term.

see the direct contribution of Chinese growth to that of its neighbors at the margin, apart from the 

indirect effect due to China’s exports to advanced economies.   

The results of such an exercise, based on 10-year rolling regressions, are presented in 

slide 14.  Note that in the first half of the 2000s, the effect of advanced-economy growth on 

emerging Asia ex. China (shown on the left) steadily rises from near zero to a one-to-one effect 

by 2005, whereas the coefficient on Chinese growth (on the right) hovers around 0.25 and is 

statistically insignificant.  These results suggest that the effect of the rise in China on the rest of 

emerging Asia in the 2000s mainly reflected China’s role as a “conduit” for trade with the 

advanced economies.   However, after the Global Financial Crisis, we see the coefficient on 

advanced-economy growth move down some, whereas the coefficient on China’s growth rises to 

0.5 and becomes statistically significant.  But the direct effect of advanced-economy growth is 

still larger than the direct effect of Chinese growth, consistent with the idea that it is still early 

days for the rebalancing of China’s economy and that China will only slowly supplant the role of 

advanced economies as drivers of emerging Asian growth. 

Rethinking the “Export-Led Growth” Paradigm  

That brings me to the final topic of my remarks today, which is how emerging Asia can 

respond to the global trade slowdown and the structural changes taking place in China.  Some of 

the structural changes I have discussed suggest that the recent deceleration of trade relative to 

GDP will likely persist and that we may expect global trade to grow perhaps about as fast as, but 

not substantially faster than, global GDP growth for the foreseeable future.  Under these 

circumstances, emerging Asian countries may not be able to look to their export sectors as the 

key source of dynamism for their economies.   


-13- 




So what’s an Asian economy to do?  I would argue that, instead of trying to restore 

growth through enhancing external surpluses, under the circumstances it makes more sense for 

emerging Asia to focus on domestic demand as an engine of its growth, and to allow their trade 

and current account surpluses to shrink.  When looking at these economies in aggregate, as 

shown in your next slide, current account surpluses narrowed greatly after the Global Financial 

Crisis but rebounded substantially thereafter.17  However, as you can see in slide 16, we have 

seen some narrowing of current account balances as a share of GDP in several emerging Asian 

economies, although in some others, such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand, the surpluses 

have increased.  Encouraging domestic demand and allowing for downward adjustment of these 

surpluses in emerging Asia, with more balances turning into deficits, would provide a much-

needed injection of demand into the global economy and also support economic growth in the 

region by providing another source of growth in place of the lessened impetus from external 

demand. 

A shift toward external deficits in Asia would be advantageous, considering the low level 

of external financing costs at present.  Many observers are raising the possibility of a “new 

normal” for the global economy, in which moderate global demand, low productivity growth, 

and slow trade may persist for some time, keeping interest rates in the advanced economies “low 

for long.”  To be sure, bond yields have moved up recently, but they remain quite low by 

historical standards.  Accordingly, the cost of external finance to Asian economies has fallen, 

which should support strong private capital flows to emerging markets.  Normally, we would 


17 See Setster (2016) for a detailed discussion of the return of the East Asian savings glut.   


-14- 




worry about volatility of these flows and how they might exacerbate risks of financial instability, 

particularly as U.S. monetary policy normalizes.  But we should also bear in mind that many 

emerging market economies (EMEs), particularly in Asia, have improved their macroeconomic 

fundamentals over the past two decades; that they have built an adequate war chest of reserves, 

with no pending need to further reserve accumulation for precautionary purposes; and that their 

currencies are much more flexible, which acts as an adjustment mechanism to shocks and also 

lessens the possibility of fluctuations in reserves due to currency intervention.  These factors 

have made the emerging Asian economies much less vulnerable.   

Given all this, dare we imagine a world in which private capital inflows to EMEs could 

prove self-sustaining, are not offset by reverse flows of official capital, and would finance long-

term profitable investment that would help support growth in these economies while also 

supporting global growth?  In essence, these capital inflows would finance the shift from export-

led growth to domestic-led growth required by the slowdown in global trade.  And, with little or 

no official outflows, EMEs would have total capital net inflows as well, consistent with running 

current account deficits instead of current account surpluses.  As pointed out recently by former 

Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke, the availability of profitable capital investments in one part of the 

world can help defeat secular stagnation in another part.18   

Of course, these developments may take time.  The point is that at this current juncture of 

the global economy, it is all the more important for emerging Asian economies—and, indeed, 

emerging market economies more broadly—to enhance domestic demand while pursuing 


18 See Bernanke (2015).   


-15- 




prudent policies.  It would be good to do this for the sake of the global economy, but emerging 

Asian economies should do this for their own sakes as well.  

(Thank you.  I would be happy to take a few questions.)
