Thank you to the Conference of State Bank Supervisors (CSBS) for this 

opportunity to share my perspective and some of my goals as a Federal Reserve Board 

governor on issues of interest to you and many in your states.1 

I emphasize that word “perspective” because the view from Washington can be 

very different from how things look in your states and communities.  No one knows that 

better than I do, of course, because not so long ago, I was sitting where you are, enjoying 

the dinner provided by CSBS and hearing the perspective from Washington.  I’m still 

enjoying the dinner tonight, but find I am now, so to speak, also on the menu.  And in this 

position, as part of the Federal Reserve but also still deeply rooted in my experience as a 

community banker and state regulator, I’ll offer my thoughts on forging a closer 

relationship and strengthening communication between the Board of Governors and state 

banking commissioners.   

First, to establish some context, let me say a few words about the Fed’s role and 

perspective on supervising community banks.  The lion’s share of community banks are 

those with total assets of $500 million or less, with the Fed defining the sector as those 

with up to $10 billion in assets.  The Federal Reserve directly supervises 731 state-

chartered community banks, which is only a small share of the number of state-chartered 

banks overseen by CSBS members.  The fact that this is only a small share of the total 

might sound to some people like the Federal Reserve has only a small role in community 

banking.  But it’s important to remember that the Fed is the primary federal supervisor 

responsible for all bank and thrift holding companies, a total of 3,912.  This includes the 

vast majority of all community banking organizations.  The Fed also influences the

supervision of all community and regional banks by developing both safety and 

soundness and consumer rules to implement laws passed by Congress, applicable to 

insured depositories and their holding companies.  Typically this is done in collaboration 

with other federal agencies and after seeking the public’s input.  I mention Congress and 

these other agencies to emphasize that the Fed shares responsibility for writing and 

implementing federal regulations for community banks. 

Now, let me describe my role.  In addition to my broader responsibilities in 

supervision and regulation, I am Chair of the Board’s Smaller Regional and Community 

Banking subcommittee, which oversees our work in this area.  I am also the Chair of the 

Board’s committee tasked with oversight of our rulemaking and supervision on consumer 

issues.    

I also participate in carrying out the Federal Reserve’s other responsibilities, such 

as conducting monetary policy and overseeing the payment system.  But it’s fair to say 

that my background in community banking was an important reason I was chosen and 

confirmed by Congress as the first person to fulfill a new requirement that at least one 

governor have primary experience working in or supervising community banks.  My 

background and commitment to community banking is also some important context for 

what I have to say about the Fed’s interests in improving communication with the 

members of CSBS.   

I mentioned a moment ago that the perspective in Washington, and from the 

Board, can be different from the view from your position as banking commissioners, and 

that is certainly true.  But one thing I have learned, since joining the Board in November, 

is that my fellow governors, along with the staff at the Board, share your view, as I do, 


 - 3 - 

about the vital importance of community banking and the essential role community banks 

play in our financial system.   

Community banks are frequently the economic engines supporting and driving the 

economies of many communities, especially in rural areas.  In these communities, they 

are the primary providers of financial services for individuals and small businesses, and a 

source of financial advice and civic leadership.  They play an indispensable role in areas 

not served by larger institutions and in other communities of all different sizes, from 

urban to rural, serving a range of customers, including some that are sometimes not as 

high a priority for larger banks.   

I think it is important to note, and too often overlooked, that the vast majority of 

community banks managed their risks well in the years leading up to and during the 

financial crisis and were not the source of the excessive risk taking that caused the crisis.  

For this reason among others, the Federal Reserve has been engaged in an active effort to 

tailor regulations, including those issued in the wake of the financial crisis, to 

appropriately reflect the potential risk that an institution might pose to financial stability.   

I am pleased to see some evidence we are making progress.  Last year’s CSBS 

survey found that community banks reported a decrease in regulatory costs in 2017.2   

This was the first reduction in burden reported since the survey began in 2014.  The 

decline was attributed to the implementation of changes stemming from the recent review 

by the banking agencies under the EGRPRA, the Economic Growth and Regulatory 

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996.  There has been progress in tailoring regulations that

affect community banks, and I believe more progress lies ahead as we implement the 

changes that Congress included in S. 2155 and explore additional opportunities to reduce 

burden while maintaining the resiliency and strength of smaller banks.3 

Before I go further, let me give a brief assessment of how community banks are 

faring.  This might seem like an issue that is primarily of interest to community bankers 

and regulators, but I don’t look at it that way at all.  One of my most important 

responsibilities now is voting on the monetary policy decisions of the Federal Open 

Market Committee, and that requires me to closely and constantly monitor the health of 

the U.S. economy.  And when community banks are the source for more than half of all 

lending to small businesses, which together account for two-thirds of private sector job 

creation, then the health of community banking has a big influence on the health of the 

U.S. economy.4 

Since the financial crisis, the health of the community-banking sector has 

improved significantly.  Over those years and today, the large majority of community 

banks have maintained sound levels of capital.  Although the number of community 

banks in the United States continues to fall due to consolidation, overall the sector 

continues to post strong earnings, which, in turn, contribute to maintaining healthy capital 

positions.  One measure of this strong financial position is that no community banks 

failed in 2018.  The shared responsibility we have as financial supervisors to ensure the 

ongoing viability of community banks requires cooperation and coordination.  We must

continue to ensure that the institutions we supervise are proactively managing their risks 

to remain strong.  It’s our job to identify emerging risks to community banks and to 

ensure bankers are identifying and managing their risks appropriately.  We want to ensure 

that loans are underwritten prudently and that bankers are actively managing the 

concentrations of credit risk in their portfolios.   

We welcome the strong lending growth that many community banks are 

experiencing, which is fueling job creation and sustaining our economic expansion, 

which in July will become the longest in U.S. history.  But strong lending growth must be 

supported by prudent, well-managed funding plans in order to manage the risk that strains 

on liquidity may arise more quickly than is sometimes anticipated.   

Now, let me turn back to my main theme today, which is fostering better 

communication between CSBS and state banking commissioners and the Board of 

Governors.  Improved communication is a top priority for me for several reasons. 

First, it is very much my approach to government service, and leadership in 

particular, to do a lot of listening.  A wise person once said that the most effective leaders 

do more listening than talking.  When I became Kansas’ State Bank Commissioner, I 

started a twice-yearly series of roundtables with the chief executives of banks across the 

state.  It was an excellent way for me to better understand the issues that were impacting 

bankers in a way that was less formal than when banks comment on rules and less fraught 

than the supervisory process.  Sure, it took time away from the office, from consultation 

with the legislature, and the deadlines all of us have faced.  In my case, considering the 

size of Kansas, it was also time away from home and family.  However, I don’t have to 


 - 6 - 

tell those of you who have also found a lot of merit in such tours that it is an enormous 

advantage to find out what is on the minds of those in the field. 

The second, very straightforward reason to foster better communication with all 

of you is that the nature of financial regulation and supervision in the United States 

argues strongly for better coordination.  To a much greater extent than in other nations, in 

the United States financial oversight is divided between the federal government and 

subnational authorities--the states.  At the federal level, responsibility is further divided 

between different agencies, such as the Fed, the FDIC, the Office of Comptroller of the 

Currency, and the National Credit Union Administration.  This system evolved over time, 

and as things stand, there are some advantages to this specialization.  But this division of 

labor may, at times, inhibit information sharing, and as a general principle, better 

communication can help overcome this challenge. 

More specifically, better communication and information sharing between state 

banking commissioners and the Federal Reserve can further improve the early 

identification and resolution of emerging issues at community banks.  Harnessing and 

sharing these sometimes divergent views can serve to strengthen a financial regulatory 

system that shares responsibility among many state and federal agencies.  Better 

communication and information sharing will benefit both you and the Federal Reserve, 

but my motivation is that the Fed has much to gain here.  Because states are responsible 

for chartering and co-supervising the large majority of community banks, they can 

provide a broader perspective into local community banking issues and trends.  

Let me pause here for a moment and say that improving communication doesn’t 

necessarily mean that the Federal Reserve and the CSBS members will always agree.  We 


 - 7 - 

won’t, and perhaps we shouldn’t.  A diversity of views can be a strength.  A robust 

discussion requires a thorough analysis of differing views, which leads to a more 

informed understanding of issues.  This healthy give and take is the fourth reason for 

better communication:  It leads to better outcomes.   

I will cite one example that I know is on the minds of many of you--the  

rulemaking process the agencies are currently engaged in on the community bank 

leverage ratio (CBLR).  Here is an excellent example of where it makes good sense to 

consult closely.  I know you have a lot of knowledge and expertise to bring to bear on 

this issue, which helps explain why Congress has required the agencies to consult with 

the states.  As you know, the Fed and the other agencies are now gathering and evaluating 

comments on the CBLR and getting feedback on this interagency proposal.  So, now is a 

good time to re-engage.  I am committed to re-engaging with you on the interagency 

proposal and ways we might be able to improve it.  I am eager to hear your thoughts.       

I have one more reason for better communication, but first I will give you an idea 

of what I have in mind for that consultation.  The formal means by which CSBS and 

others comment on a rulemaking is important, but I think we would also all benefit from 

more informal, and more frequent contact.  If you have an issue, if you have something to 

say, just pick up the phone.  It is also my intention to be on the road a lot, visiting Federal 

Reserve Districts and talking to bankers, consumers, and community groups.  When I 

come to your state, I hope to see you, and I promise to make time to talk.  

My final reason for better communication brings me back to a point I made at the 

outset: the United States needs a strong community-banking sector.  We need strong 

community banks because they help support strong communities.  Strong communities 


 - 8 - 

are the building blocks of a strong nation.  They provide safety, education and economic 

opportunities, and help define the values we hold dear.  Community banks are vital to the 

success of communities.  They help us save and plan for a better future.  The credit they 

extend helps preserve farming as a way of life for American families, and provides the 

means for small businesses to start and to thrive, which is so important to the health of 

communities.   

This is not an abstract notion for me.  As a community banker, I have seen how 

access to credit and support from a financial institution with deep roots in a community 

can make a direct and immediate difference in people’s lives.  I continued to feel that 

way when I did the job you do, as a state banking commissioner, helping ensure that 

families and communities have access to financial services that are so important to their 

success.  I enjoyed being a community banker, and I hope you know I’ve enjoyed 

working closely with all of you as a banking commissioner, and I now look forward to 

building a stronger partnership between all of you and the Federal Reserve Board. 

Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today. I hope to see you soon in 

your states, and I wish you a productive and enjoyable visit to Washington.
