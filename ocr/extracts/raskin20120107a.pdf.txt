  Thank you and happy New Year.  It is a pleasure to be with you today as you 

meet to discuss so many pressing and important issues.  I know there has been much 

discussion at this conference about the public function of law schools and I commend you 

for tackling this essential challenge.  In my speech today, I hope to add to the 

conversation a little bit by presenting a simple argument, that laws and regulations must 

be enforced, and enforcement must be part of what we teach lawyers and future 

lawmakers to study.  What we think of as the rule of law encompasses not merely 

theories of the process by which public laws and regulations are created through 

particular legislative and administrative procedures, and not merely theories of how laws 

and regulations are interpreted by courts.  The rule of law includes enforcement itself.  

The rule of law compels us to consider whether a rule has been crafted in such a way that 

it is capable of being complied with and capable of being enforced effectively by state 

actors.  The rule of law also involves decisions about whether there has been compliance, 

and if not, what should be done about it. 

The failure of timely enforcement leads to the entrenchment of bad practices and 

an increase in the costs of correction.  For example, turning to what will be the focus of 

my comments today--the role of mortgage servicers in the foreclosure crisis--the longer it 

takes for mortgage servicers to make the operational adjustments necessary to fix their 

sloppy and deceptive practices, the costlier and more difficult it becomes for them to sort 

them out and correct them.   

More fundamentally, a failure by regulators to enforce the laws and regulations as 

strong antidotes to financial misconduct and unsafe and unsound practices by the 

institutions they regulate establishes de facto acquiescence to the dominant norms of the 


 - 2 -

financial marketplace.  At that point, our laws become the resting place for unfair 

practices and broad disrespect for the law generally.  This is a phenomenon that 

Shakespeare’s Angelo observed in “Measure for Measure” when he said: 

We must not make a scarecrow of the law, 

 Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, 

And let it keep one shape, till custom make it  

Their perch and not their terror. 


For sure, different regulatory regimes could have different answers regarding the 

best way to enforce laws and regulations.  As law professors teaching both the substance 

of law and the practice of law, I imagine you find ways within your courses and 

scholarship to discuss theories of enforcement--for example, the use of private rights of 

action versus enforcement by regulatory agencies; different enforcement tools such as 

memoranda of understanding, consent orders, and cease and desist agreements; how these 

different enforcement tools are sequenced; and whether and when violations of law 

should be publicized. 

In answering all of these questions, there is consensus that public enforcement 

should be used in addressing pervasive regulatory problems.  Today I want to talk about 

how home mortgage foreclosures hurt the pace of an economic recovery, and how 

important it is that the severe misconduct that has been uncovered in the mortgage 

servicing sector be addressed through intensified public enforcement of the law as part of 

the overarching effort to rebuild our damaged communities and neighborhoods.

Mortgage Servicing and the Economy  

The economic downturn that began in late 2007 and worsened considerably in the 

autumn of that year resulted in the worst recession in many decades.  Although recovery 

from the recession officially began in the third quarter of 2009, the pace of recovery has 

been modest, resulting in an unemployment rate that has remained at or above 8.5 percent 

since mid-2009.  This sustained high unemployment rate--with all the attendant social 

consequences, including lost income and family strains--has contributed to an 

unprecedented number of mortgage foreclosures throughout the nation.  

     This wave of foreclosures is one of the factors hindering a rapid recovery in the 

economy.  Traditionally, the housing sector, buoyed by low interest rates and pent-up 

demand, has played an important role in propelling economic recoveries.  The increase in 

housing sales and construction often is accompanied by purchases of complementary 

goods, like furniture and appliances, which magnify the effect of the housing recovery. 

      However, six years after house prices first began to fall, the pace of the economic 

recovery remains slow.  Nationally, house prices have fallen by nearly one-third since 

their peak in the first quarter of 2006, and total homeowners’ equity in the United States 

has shrunk by more than one-half--a loss of more than $7 trillion.  The drop in house 

prices has had far-reaching effects on families, neighborhoods, small businesses, and the 

economy, in part because so many American families--more than 65 percent--own their 

homes.  The fall in house prices has caused families to cut back on their spending and has 

prevented them from using their home equity to fund education expenses or start small 

businesses.  The decline in house prices has also impeded families from benefiting from 

the historically low level of interest rates, as perhaps only half of homeowners who could

profitably refinance have the equity and creditworthiness needed to qualify for traditional 

refinancing.1 

    Throughout the successive waves in foreclosures that have occurred since 2007, 

problems in mortgage servicing have emerged and persisted.  These problems have 

included critical weaknesses in mortgage servicers’ foreclosure governance processes, 

foreclosure document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party 

law firms and other vendors.  Collectively, these problems have hampered the ability of 

the courts and the markets to work through the foreclosure inventory in an efficient 

manner. 

Significant judicial resources are being expended on resolving the legal problems 

related to mortgage servicing.  Indeed, the dockets of federal courts, bankruptcy courts, 

and state courts include numerous cases involving a wide range of troubling issues, such 

as claims of missing or forged promissory notes; claims that mortgage servicers have 

foreclosed on the houses of active-duty U.S. soldiers who are legally eligible to have 

foreclosures halted; sworn affidavits containing false “facts” that homeowners were in 

arrears for amounts not yet due; claims of falsifications of documents required to transfer 

ownership of the mortgage; allegations of false affidavits claiming homeowners owe fees 

for services never rendered; and claims of false affidavits overstating how much 

homeowners are behind on their payments.   

And this is a sampling of the legal issues related just to mortgage servicing.  

There is another galaxy of vexing issues surrounding recordation and title issues and

claims related to an entity called the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, or MERS.  

Significantly, the necessarily slow pace of a judicial response to these legal issues hinders 

the ability of the housing market to regain function and become a driver of a more-robust 

economic recovery. 

Response to Misconduct 

In addition to the effect on the macroeconomy, this current judicial morass 

reflects profound and pervasive misconduct in mortgage servicing.  It also calls for timely 

public enforcement.  While the courts sort out--one by one--the mortgage servicing cases, 

the Federal Reserve, together with other federal and state regulators, must create, 

implement, and complete an enforcement response.  Accordingly, in 2010, the Federal 

Reserve and the other federal banking agencies began a targeted review of mortgage 

servicing problems at 14 large, federally regulated financial institutions that had 

significant market concentrations in mortgage servicing. 

  From these examinations, the agencies found significant problems with the 

mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing at all 14 of them, which collectively 

represent more than two-thirds of all mortgage servicing volume nationally.  The 

problems found by the agencies pose risks to the safety and soundness of the institutions, 

impair the functioning of mortgage markets, and diminish overall accountability of 

mortgage servicers to homeowners.  As a result of these findings, in April 2011 the 

Federal Reserve issued formal enforcement actions requiring the four mortgage servicers 

that it regulates and the holding companies of six national bank servicers regulated by the 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to address the deficient practices in 


 - 6 -

residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processing.2  The OCC and the Office 

of Thrift Supervision simultaneously issued actions against mortgage servicers, resulting 

in enforcement actions against 14 banking institutions with mortgage servicing 

operations.   

The enforcement actions are cease and desist orders and are legally enforceable in 

federal court.  The enforcement orders require, among other things, the mortgage 

servicers to submit corrective action plans addressing the errors discovered during the 

targeted reviews and to implement practices designed to prevent future abuses in the loan 

modification and foreclosure process.  The plans must be acceptable to the Federal 

Reserve.  And to be acceptable, for example, the plans must detail ways the mortgage 

servicer will increase and enhance the staffing and other resources allocated to the 

mortgage servicer’s loan modification and foreclosure departments.  Such requirements 

relate to the failure of mortgage servicers to provide adequate staffing to carry out 

residential mortgage loan servicing, loss mitigation, and foreclosure activities.  The 

increased resources required by the enforcement orders are meant to improve a 

homeowner’s ability to readily obtain information and assistance from the mortgage 

servicer and to decrease errors made by mortgage servicers when modifying loans or 

pursuing foreclosures.  The corrective action plans also must address other significant 

mortgage servicing and foreclosure-governance shortfalls and must be designed to ensure 

compliance with state and federal mortgage servicing and foreclosure laws.  They must 

also improve foreclosure management information systems; establish robust controls and

oversight over the activities of third party vendors; and strengthen communication with 

borrowers during loss mitigation and foreclosure processes.   

  Many of the corrective action plans mandated by the enforcement actions require 

mortgage servicers to change the way they conduct critical aspects of their business.  For 

example, the corrective action plans require improved communications with borrowers 

before a foreclosure may proceed.  In particular, the mortgage servicer must thoroughly 

explore loan modification options with the homeowner.  The mortgage servicer must also 

improve the way it communicates with homeowners by establishing a “single point of 

contact” for homeowners in loss mitigation or foreclosure to use when they need help 

from the mortgage servicer in addressing problems.  By having a single person at the 

mortgage servicer with whom to communicate, homeowners should be able to receive 

more reliable, accurate, and prompt information about their mortgages, modification 

options, and the status of any foreclosure actions.    

These orders also require each firm to hire an independent consultant to review 

the firms’ past practices to identify specific cases in which these practices resulted in 

financial injury to specific consumers.  This enforcement technique, known as a “look-

back,” is the current subject of much debate in the mortgage servicing context because it 

requires firms to use an independent consultant.  The consultant reports both to the 

enforcing agency and to the firm, allowing the agency to better monitor and judge the 

completeness of the look-back. 

 Requiring an independent review of certain banking operations is not a new 

enforcement tool.  Historically, independent reviews have most often been required by 

the Federal Reserve in connection with a banking organization’s money-laundering or 


 - 8 -

Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctions-compliance programs.  Independent 

reviews typically require the regulated entity to hire a third party to do more time-

intensive work than the regulator has already done.  The examiners have perhaps found a 

problem and want the institution, at its own expense rather than taxpayer expense, to do 

more extensive scoping and remediation. 

Monetary Penalties and Transparency 

The enforcement actions against these 14 institutions and the associated corrective 

action plans are only a start in a comprehensive enforcement response to the foreclosure 

crisis.  Monetary penalties for the deficient practices in mortgage loan servicing and 

foreclosure processing also must be imposed against the 14 institutions.  The Federal 

Reserve and other federal regulators must impose penalties for deficiencies that resulted 

in unsafe and unsound practices or violations of federal law, just as state banking 

commissioners and state attorneys general impose penalties for violations of state law.  

The Federal Reserve believes monetary sanctions in these cases are appropriate and plans 

to announce monetary penalties.  One purpose of monetary penalties, when they are 

appropriately sized, is to incentivize mortgage servicers to incorporate strong programs to 

comply with laws when they build their business models.  This is an operational purpose, 

but as mentioned earlier, monetary penalties also remind regulated institutions that non-

compliance has real consequences; the law is not a scarecrow where the birds of prey can 

seek refuge and perch to plan their next attack. 

It is also worth noting the obvious, which is that Congress enacted some of the 

laws that are allegedly being violated--they are public laws.  Their efficacy must be 

evaluated and re-evaluated by the public.  This means that enforcement of laws must 


 - 9 -

occur in a manner that permits an appropriate public evaluation.  There is currently a 

lively debate about the appropriateness and value of transparency regarding the 

regulatory remediation required by the enforcement actions entered into with the 14 

mortgage servicers.  The fact that this public debate is occurring is entirely appropriate, 

and underscores the importance that Americans place on enforcement in the mortgage 

servicing context. 

The cease and desist orders against the 14 large mortgage servicers are publicly 

available; they have been fully disclosed.  The corrective actions that the mortgage 

servicers are undertaking pursuant to the enforcement actions in an appropriate format 

also need to be shared with the public.  Not only is the public directly and significantly 

affected by how the acts of mortgage servicers have contributed to the state of the 

economy, but cities, neighborhoods, and communities have a direct and significant 

interest in the role that mortgage servicers play in the value of a homeowner’s 

investment. 

Conclusion 

Too many of the practices in the mortgage servicing industry have been 

developed and defended solely on the basis of “standard industry practice,” but many 

practices were not only standard, but shoddy.  This has proven true, I might add, on the 

underwriting and secondary-market sides of the business, and we are seeing courts reject 

many of those practices.   

 Appropriately tailored enforcement against these mortgage servicing practices is 

necessary as one way to rebuild an important sector of the housing market.  Accordingly, 

current deficiencies must be corrected.  


 - 10 -

What’s more, financial institutions need to understand that they are responsible 

for assessing the effects their actions will have on consumers and the country as a whole, 

and factor those considerations into their business decisions.  We should not forget that 

effective enforcement of our laws can animate our efforts as policymakers, regulators, 

business innovators, legal educators, and lawyers in creating the conditions that must 

exist for the emergence of an improved mortgage-servicing model that hinders neither 

economic growth nor homeowners’ legal security.  If a law is worth having, the law is 

worth enforcing. 

Thank you.
