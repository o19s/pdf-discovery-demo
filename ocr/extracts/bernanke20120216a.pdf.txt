“The Future of Community Banking” 


A Conference Sponsored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 


Arlington, Virginia 




February 16, 2012 



It is a pleasure to speak at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s (FDIC) 

conference on the future of community banking.  This conference is indeed an important 

and timely one.  Community banks make a critical contribution to the prosperity of both 

their localities and the nation as a whole, which is why we at the Federal Reserve and the 

other banking agencies are acutely interested in their long-term strength and viability.
1
   

Today I will discuss the role community banking organizations play in supporting 

the health of our economy, as well as some of the challenges they face.  Because we 

greatly value our ongoing dialogue with community banks, I will also speak about the 

Federal Reserve’s efforts to improve our understanding of the pressures affecting 

community banks and to foster constructive supervisory relationships.   

The Role of Community Banks in a Challenging Economy  

Although community banks provide a wide range of services for their customers, 

their primary activities revolve around the traditional banking model--specifically, taking 

short-term deposits to fund longer-term investments, such as small business, agricultural, 

or commercial real estate loans.  Accordingly, risks at community banks tend to arise 

from their lending, in the form of credit risk, interest rate risk, or concentration risk, 

rather than from the trading, market-making, and investment banking activities associated 

with the largest banks.  However, by taking on and managing the risks of local lending, 

which larger banks may be unwilling or unable to do, community banks help keep their 

local economies vibrant and growing.  Importantly, community banks are well positioned 

to go beyond the standardized credit models used by larger banks and consider a range of

 For purposes of these remarks, the terms “community bank” and “community banking organization” will 

be used interchangeably to refer to both banks and bank holding companies with total consolidated assets 

of $10 billion or less.

factors when making credit decisions.  In particular, they often respond with greater 

agility to lending requests than their national competitors because of their detailed 

knowledge of the needs of their customers and their close ties to the communities they 

serve.  

While community banks have certain natural advantages, they also face an array 

of challenges, stemming from both the current economy and, to some extent, from their 

business model.  The close ties of community banks to local economies is a source of 

strength, as I mentioned, but those close linkages have drawbacks as well, most notably 

the resulting concentration of exposures to those same local economies.  Strong 

community banks take measures to counteract this risk, but it is not possible to fully 

manage it away.  Thus, the fortunes of communities and their banks tend to rise and fall 

together.  Community banks must also manage concentration risks arising from their 

specialization in certain categories of lending.  For example, larger banks have used their 

scale to gain a pricing advantage over community banks in volume-driven businesses 

such as consumer lending.  This strategy, in turn, has exacerbated a long-standing trend 

toward a greater concentration of community bank lending in certain areas less dependent 

on volume, such as loans secured by commercial real estate.  Community banks will need 

to continue their ongoing efforts to prudently diversify their revenue sources. 

Like larger banks, community banks are also being affected by the state of the 

national economy.  Despite some recent signs of improvement, the recovery has been 

frustratingly slow, constraining opportunities for profitable lending.  As I will discuss 

later, actual and prospective changes in the regulatory landscape have also raised 

concerns among community bankers.  These headwinds notwithstanding, measures of the 


- 3 - 
 


financial condition of community banks appear to have strengthened somewhat, 

suggesting that, for the most part, the industry is meeting its challenges.  Profits of 

smaller banks have risen for the past several quarters.  Although the ratios of 

nonperforming assets remain high in many cases, asset quality appears to be stabilizing, 

and bank provisions for loan losses are decreasing.  In addition, capital ratios are steadily 

improving at community banks, in part due to increases in retained earnings and a greater 

ability to raise new capital. 

Let me take this opportunity to mention one concern that is of particular relevance 

to the Federal Reserve:  A common complaint on the part of some community bankers is 

that very low interest rates hurt their profitability by squeezing net interest margins.  

Since the onset of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy has been 

accommodative, as you know.  In particular, the federal funds target rate, which stood at 

5-1/4 percent in mid-2007, was lowered to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent by the end of 2008 

and has since remained at that level.  Although these policies do not seem to have led to 

much change in aggregate measures of net interest margins, at least thus far, we continue 

to hear that many banks are feeling pressures from this source.  

The effects of the configuration of interest rates on banks and other financial 

institutions are certainly part of the discussion when we strive to determine the 

appropriate monetary policy.  Several points should be made, though.  First, it is true that 

the difference between the yield on safe assets such as Treasury securities and the rate 

paid on deposits is currently relatively low.  However, banks’ net interest margins also 

depend importantly on the difference between the return on the loans the banks make and 

the return on their alternative investments in safe assets.  When loan demand is weak, 


- 4 - 
 


forcing banks to hold low-return safe assets instead of lending, net interest margins 

suffer.  The purpose of the Federal Reserve’s policy of low interest rates is to speed the 

economic recovery, which will increase loan demand and opportunities for profitable 

lending, among many other benefits, and thus, ultimately, lead to higher net interest 

margins.  In short, it is necessary to set the negative effects on net interest margins 

against the positive effects of a strengthening economic and lending environment.  

Moreover, the benefits of a stronger economy for the performance of existing assets 

should also be taken into account; as you know, delinquencies decline as the economy 

improves.  Putting all these considerations together, in the longer term the overall effect 

on bank profitability of an appropriately accommodative monetary policy is almost 

certainly positive.   

Outreach and Communication with Community Banks 

I think we would all agree that two-way communication between regulators and 

community banks is critical.  The Fed and other bank supervisors, at both the state and 

federal levels, must clearly communicate their supervisory policies and expectations to 

banks, but they also must listen to and understand banks’ concerns.  For the Federal 

Reserve in particular, community banks not only provide insights into their industry, but 

they are also an unmatched source of crucial grassroots information about developments 

in the economy as a whole, which is necessary for effective monetary policy. 

At the Federal Reserve, we pursue our dialogue with community bankers through 

many channels.  One such channel is the recently established Community Depository 


- 5 - 
 


Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC).
2
  The council’s membership is drawn from 

smaller banks, credit unions, and savings associations.  Each of the 12 Reserve Banks 

around the country has a local advisory council, and one representative from each local 

council serves on the national council that meets with the Board in Washington twice a 

year.  These meetings allow the Federal Reserve Board to hear directly from community 

bankers about supervisory and regulatory issues that affect their institutions as well as 

about local economic trends.   

At a recent meeting, for example, one of our CDIAC members asked us to be 

clearer about whether particular rules and guidance apply to community banks.  Having 

heard from this banker as well as others, we are now working to more explicitly indicate 

which banks will be affected when we issue new regulatory proposals, final rules, or 

regulatory guidance.  As a first step in this effort, when issuing supervisory letters, we 

have begun to state specifically if and how new guidance will apply to community 

banks.
3
  Although this change seems relatively simple, we hope it will help banks avoid 

allocating precious resources to poring over supervisory guidance that does not apply to 

them.  We also hope that it will provide greater clarification to our examiners, who are on 

the frontline fielding questions from bankers and working closely with their state 

regulatory counterparts. 

In addition to the advisory council, the Board last year established a special 

supervision subcommittee to more effectively address community banking issues.

Because of their professional backgrounds in community banking and bank supervision, I 

asked Governors Elizabeth Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve on this subcommittee.  

Its primary role is to improve our understanding of community and regional banking 

conditions and to review policy proposals for their potential effect on the safety and 

soundness of, and the regulatory costs imposed on, community and regional institutions.
4
  

Governors Duke and Raskin are also keenly interested in how our policies could affect 

the availability of credit to sound borrowers, and their unique experiences and 

perspectives have contributed to the Board’s understanding of the issues that community 

bankers care most about. 

We have other contacts with community banks that have proved valuable.  For 

quite a few years, the Reserve Banks have maintained local training and outreach 

programs for banks.  More recently, several of these programs have been expanded 

nationally.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis organizes national “Ask 

the Fed” calls to provide bankers with an opportunity to hear Federal Reserve staff 

discuss recent policy initiatives and issues that examiners are encountering in the field.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco hosts consumer compliance 

webinars, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia publishes a quarterly overview 

of consumer compliance issues that allows Federal Reserve staff to address questions 

from banks.
5
  We are exploring options for building on these initiatives.

 For the purposes of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory programs, regional banking organizations generally 

are considered to be those banks and bank holding companies (including savings and loan holding 

companies) with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion.

Research by economists throughout the Federal Reserve System is another means 

of gaining a better understanding not only about current conditions in community 

banking, but also about the more fundamental forces that drive their profitability and 

lending.  Our researchers have looked at such topics as the use of credit scoring in small 

business lending, the willingness and ability of community banks to lend to small 

businesses that have lost access to lending from large banks, and the determinants of 

community bank performance both before and during the recent financial crisis--and the 

extent to which these determinants were under the control of bank managers.
6
  Our hope 

is that this focused research effort not only will hone our understanding of the key role 

that community banks play in the U.S. economy, but also will help us to more effectively 

supervise these banks.  With that, let me shift to some supervisory and regulatory matters 

that are on the minds of both supervisors and bankers. 

The Supervision of Community Banks 

  Unlike most other businesses, banks are subject to rigorous examination and 

supervision to assess their safety and soundness, their ability to withstand risks, and their 

compliance with a variety of laws.
7
  At community banks, these examinations involve 

off-site analyses and on-site visits by teams of examiners, exit meetings between 

                                                           
6
 The use of credit scoring in small business lending is discussed in Allen Berger, Adrian Cowan, and Scott 

Frame (2011), “The Surprising Use of Credit Scoring in Small Business Lending by Community Banks and 

the Attendant Effects on Credit Availability, Risk, and Profitability,” Journal of Financial Services 

Research, vol. 39 (April), pp. 1-17; the topic of community banks that lend to small businesses is discussed 

in Jihye Jeon, Judit Montoriol-Garriga, Robert K. Triest, and J. Christina Wang (2010), “Evidence of a 

Credit Crunch?  Results from the 2010 Survey of First District Community Banks,” Federal Reserve Bank 

of Boston, Public Policy Briefs, no. 10-3 (September), www.bos.frb.org/economic/ppb/2010/ppb103.pdf; 

and the determinants of community bank performance are discussed in Dean F. Amel and Robin A. Prager 

(2010), “Performance of Community Banks in Good Times and Bad Times,” unpublished paper, Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Research and Statistics, May.

 Examinations typically occur annually but may take place more or less frequently depending on the size 

and condition of the banking organization.  The Federal Reserve maintains a full-time, on-site presence at 

the largest banking organizations.

examiners and senior bank managers to discuss examination results, and written reports 

with narratives and metrics describing the examiners’ findings.  If necessary, of course, 

examiners may require actions by the bank to remedy specific problems.   

These examinations, in combination with work we undertake between 

examinations, are critical for promoting safety and soundness while enhancing our 

understanding of the condition of individual banks and the banking system as a whole.  

We know, however, that supervision imposes costs on institutions.  In particular, we 

recognize that new regulations and supervisory requirements may impose 

disproportionate costs on community banks, which have smaller staffs and less-elaborate 

information systems than larger banking organizations.  Thus, we take quite seriously the 

importance of evaluating the costs and benefits of new rules. 

As I have noted, the comparative advantage of community bankers is that they 

know and work with their communities and customers in ways that may not be possible 

for larger, more distant institutions.  We tailor our examination and supervision to the 

size, complexity, risk profile, and business model of each institution.  For community 

banks in particular, our examiners are expected to take local market conditions into 

account when assessing a bank’s management and credit decisions.  The Federal 

Reserve’s decentralized structure, in which supervision is conducted through 12 regional 

Reserve Banks, helps facilitate our understanding of local economies, as does our 

ongoing coordination with state banking regulators.  This connection to Main Street is 

vitally important to fulfilling both our supervisory and monetary policy responsibilities.  

Bank supervision requires a delicate balance--particularly now.  The weak 

economy, together with loose lending standards in the past, has put pressure on the entire 


- 9 - 
 


banking industry, including community banks.  To protect banks from a possible race to 

the bottom and new problems down the road, and to safeguard the Deposit Insurance 

Fund, supervisors must insist on high standards for lending, risk management, and 

governance.  At the same time, it is important for banks, for their communities, and for 

the national economy that banks lend to creditworthy borrowers.  Lending to 

creditworthy borrowers, after all, is how banks earn profits.  Getting that balance right is 

not always easy, but it is of utmost importance. 

 Regulatory Challenges for Community Banking 

Community bankers tell us repeatedly that they are concerned about the changing 

regulatory environment.  They touch on a number of areas, but one particular worry is the 

implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

(Dodd-Frank Act). 

It is important to emphasize that the Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act largely 

in response to the “too big to fail” problem, and that most of its provisions apply only, or 

principally, to the largest, most complex, and internationally active banks.  To mitigate 

the threat to financial stability posed by systemically important financial firms, the act 

required the Federal Reserve to implement enhanced prudential standards to regulate 

these firms.  The Board in December requested comment on proposed rules for 

systemically important firms, including stronger capital, leverage, liquidity, and risk-

management requirements.  Other aspects of the proposed rules are single-counterparty 

credit limits and requirements to periodically produce resolution plans (known as living 


- 10 - 
 


wills) and to conduct stress tests.
8
  The proposed rules, in conjunction with other 

elements of the Dodd-Frank Act, are designed to make these firms safer and to force 

large firms to take into account the costs that their potential failure could impose on the 

broader financial system.  

These new standards are not meant to apply to, and clearly would not be 

appropriate for, community banks.  Indeed, the Dodd-Frank Act explicitly exempts 

community banks from these new enhanced standards.  Community banks express 

concern that the more stringent requirements for larger institutions will eventually find 

their way to smaller firms; that, however, is not our intent, and we will work to ensure 

that it does not happen.  An example that predates the Dodd-Frank Act is the interagency 

guidance issued in June 2010 covering incentive compensation.
9
  In that guidance, we 

were careful to note simplified expectations for community banks that did not make 

extensive use of incentive compensation.  We intend to continue this practice for other 

policies and guidance and to continue to speak with community bankers to respond to 

their questions and concerns and to clarify our supervisory expectations. 

Given the ongoing supervisory and regulatory changes, the Board and its senior-

level staff members have made it a priority to work with other regulators to increase the 

coordination and consistency of regulation across a banking industry that has multiple 

regulators and charters.  We regularly consult on these matters with the Consumer 

Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and other

agencies.
10

  The new Financial Stability Oversight Council also provides a forum for 

agencies to discuss the coordination of policies and initiatives.  It is important that we at 

the Federal Reserve continue to work closely with other agencies on supervisory matters, 

particularly in cases in which a common regulatory approach across agencies and across 

banking organizations with different charters has the potential to reduce compliance costs 

and risks.  

One of the areas where communication between banks and examiners is 

especially important is in the ongoing supervisory process.  We conduct extensive 

training for our examiners, perform internal reviews and studies to ensure that the 

examiners are properly interpreting supervisory guidance, and stress that a main goal of 

supervision is to help bankers sustain sound lending and risk-management practices.  We 

emphasize that open dialogue with bank management is an essential component of 

effective supervision. 

Although we hope that bankers are able to resolve all examination issues through 

discussion with the examiner-in-charge or Reserve Bank management, it is inevitable that 

examiners and bankers will sometimes differ over examination findings despite our best 

efforts.  For those cases, the Federal Reserve has a robust appeals process, as well as an 

independent ombudsman, to provide institutions with a fair and thorough review of 

complaints.

 A banking organization’s board or management may appeal any material

supervisory determination to a review panel composed of Reserve Bank staff that were 

not involved in the original supervisory determination and that were selected after 

consultation with staff at the Board in Washington.  Bank managers may submit relevant 

information to this panel in writing and may appear in person. 

If the bank’s managers or board believe this panel’s decision did not address their 

concerns in a satisfactory manner, the bank may make a second appeal to the president of 

the relevant Reserve Bank.  A third review--undertaken by the member of the Board of 

Governors with oversight responsibility for the Federal Reserve’s banking supervision, 

who at present is Governor Tarullo--can be requested if the institution is still not satisfied 

that its concerns have been addressed. 

The Federal Reserve’s ombudsman mediates complaints, facilitates appeals, and, 

where appropriate, refers matters to committees of the Board.

  We are working to 

increase awareness of the ombudsman’s office and encouraging bankers to use the 

ombudsman for matters that cannot be resolved at the local level.  Importantly, the 

ombudsman reaches out to every institution that has filed an appeal within six months 

after the appeal has been decided to ensure that no retaliation or other unjustified 

reactions have taken place.  The ombudsman has broad authority to investigate claims of 

retaliation, and, when appropriate, will report complaints to the Board.  The Board will 

not tolerate retaliation against banking organizations that file appeals or raise concerns 

about the supervisory process.  Beyond simple fairness, hearing concerns from banks

about supervisory practices gives us extremely valuable feedback that will help us 

improve supervision and better understand the issues that banks and examiners confront 

in the field. 

Conclusion 

To conclude, I would like to reemphasize the importance that my colleagues on 

the Board and I place on the Federal Reserve’s relationship with community banks.  The 

Fed is committed to fair, consistent, and informed examinations that take into account the 

size, complexity, and individual circumstances of each bank we oversee.  We will 

continue to rely on the many channels of communication I discussed today to improve 

our supervision, and we will do all we can to eliminate unnecessary costs.  By engaging 

in a constant dialogue with community banks through various communication channels 

and through the examination process, the Federal Reserve is able to collect important 

information about local economies and better inform banks about the applicability and 

expectations of new rules and regulations intended to help keep them safe and sound.  

Despite economic uncertainties, the condition of community banks is improving, which is 

reassuring given their undeniable importance to the health of our nation’s economy. 

My thanks to the FDIC and Marty Gruenberg for convening this important 

conference.
