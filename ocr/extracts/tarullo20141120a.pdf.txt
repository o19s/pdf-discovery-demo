 The financial turbulence of 2008 was largely defined by the dangers of runs--realized, 

incipient, and feared.  Facing deep uncertainty about the condition of counterparties and the 

value of assets serving as collateral, many funding markets ground to a halt, as investors refused 

to offer new short-term lending or even to roll over existing repos and similar extensions of 

credit.  In the first instance, at least, this was a liquidity crisis.  Its fast-moving dynamic was very 

different from that of the savings and loan crisis or the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980s.  

The phenomenon of runs instead recalled a more distant banking crisis--that of the 1930s.   

 Despite this defining characteristic of the last crisis, measures to regulate liquidity have 

by-and-large lagged other regulatory reforms, for at least two reasons.  First, prior to the crisis 

there was very little use of quantitative liquidity regulation and thus little experience on which to 

draw.  While the Basel Committee got to work quickly, senior central bankers and heads of bank 

supervisory agencies extended the timeline for implementation of liquidity standards to guard 

against unanticipated, undesirable consequences from these innovative regulatory efforts.  A 

second reason liquidity regulation has followed other reforms is that judicious liquidity 

regulation both complements, and is dependent upon, other important financial policies--notably 

capital regulation, resolution procedures, and lender-of-last-resort (LOLR) practice.  Work on 

liquidity regulations has both built on reforms in these other areas and occasioned some 

consideration of the interaction among these various policies. 

 But while perhaps a bit drawn out, the work has proceeded.  A final version of a 

Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was agreed internationally and has been adopted by regulation 


- 2 - 
 

in the United States.1  The Basel Committee’s recently announced final Net Stable Funding 

Ratio (NSFR) is another significant milestone in building out a program of liquidity regulation.  

Today I would like to take stock of the progress that has been made.  I will first describe 

the role of liquidity regulation, including how it relates to those other dimensions of regulation I 

mentioned a moment ago.  Next, I will review the specific liquidity regulatory and supervisory 

measures that have been put in place or are in the process of development.  In concluding, I will 

offer an interim appraisal of our approach to liquidity regulation and identify some of the issues 

that remain.   

The Role of Liquidity Regulation 

 Liquidity vulnerabilities are, of course, inherent to most forms of financial 

intermediation.  The canonical case is that of maturity transformation by a very conventional 

bank, which takes demand deposits and uses the funds to make loans that are repaid only over 

time.  Should an unusual number of depositors want to withdraw their funds, for whatever 

reason, the bank may not have sufficient cash on hand to meet those demands.  And, because the 

value of most of the bank’s loans will be difficult for outsiders to determine, they can be sold to 

generate more cash only at a significant discount and probably not as quickly as the bank’s 

liquidity needs might dictate.  If depositors other than those initially seeking to withdraw funds 

hear that the bank may have difficulty meeting the demand, they may be motivated to join the 

withdrawal line before the bank runs out of cash entirely or, even worse, becomes insolvent.  

This, of course, leads to a bank run.

Comptroller of the Currency (2014), “Federal Banking Regulators Finalize Liquidity Coverage Ratio,” press release, 
September 3, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20140903a.htm.

 The classic responses to this classic problem have been a combination of deposit 

insurance and discount window access.  The former, established as part of New Deal banking 

reforms, assures depositors that they need not worry about insolvency, thereby presumably 

keeping out of the withdrawal line depositors who thought they might lose their funds entirely.  

The latter gives the bank access to short-term liquidity in order to meet the demands of 

depositors who have an immediate need for cash.  Regulatory requirements were imposed to 

guard against the moral hazard that both programs could create.  The resulting system meant that 

there were relatively few liquidity problems in the deposit-funded commercial banking system 

over the ensuing few decades. 

Beginning in the 1970s, deposits began to decline as a proportion of funding for credit 

intermediation, as the separation of traditional lending and capital markets activities established 

by New Deal financial regulation began to break down.  During the succeeding three decades, 

these activities became progressively more integrated, as credit intermediation relied more 

heavily on capital market instruments sold to institutional investors.  Over time, these markets 

became--like traditional commercial banks--an important locus of maturity transformation, 

which in turn led to both an expansion and alteration of traditional money markets.  Ultimately, 

there was a vast increase in the creation of so-called cash equivalent instruments, which were 

supposedly safe, short-term, and liquid.  

When, in 2007, questions arose about the quality of some of the assets on which this 

intermediation system was based--notably, those tied to poorly underwritten subprime 

mortgages--a classic adverse feedback loop ensued.  Investors formerly willing to lend against 

almost any asset on a short-term, secured basis were suddenly unwilling to lend against a wide 

range of assets.  Liquidity-strained institutions found themselves forced to sell positions, which 




- 4 - 
 

placed additional downward pressure on asset prices, thereby accelerating margin calls on 

leveraged actors and amplifying mark-to-market losses for all holders of the assets.  The margin 

calls and booked losses would start another round in the adverse feedback loop.  In short, the 

financial industry in the years preceding the crisis had been transformed into one that was highly 

susceptible to runs on the short-term, uninsured cash equivalents that funded longer-term 

extensions of credit.2  

Designing and implementing a policy response in light of the vulnerabilities of short-term 

wholesale funding markets that were revealed in the 2007–09 crisis is an integral part of post-

crisis reform.  The key question is how to balance the important role these markets have come to 

play in funding economic activity with the need to contain the destabilizing risks of runs in these 

same markets.  To get a better sense of the terms of this balancing effort, let me examine the 

implications, first, of relying completely on liquidity requirements to manage liquidity problems, 

and then of relying entirely on LOLR liquidity from a central bank.  The shortcomings associated 

with either of these one-dimensional approaches demonstrate why liquidity regulation and LOLR 

should be viewed as complements and not substitutes.3   

2 Note that financial entities that do not use debt financing can nevertheless experience liquidity pressures that are 
structurally similar to bank runs.  For example, in the context of various pooled investment vehicles, investors may 
have an incentive to redeem their shares early because the costs of the redemptions are effectively borne by 
remaining investors.  The resulting “first-mover advantage” contributed to runs on money market mutual funds in 
the fall of 2008 and could, at least in theory, lead to runs on other open-end fund vehicles.  The U.S. Financial 
Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) is currently developing a work plan to analyze potential risks associated with 
asset management products and activities (minutes of the October 6, 2014, meeting, 
www.treasury.gov/initiatives/fsoc/council-
meetings/Documents/October%206,%202014%20(Meeting%20Minutes).pdf). 
3 For a detailed discussion of many of the issues I mention here, see Mark Carlson, Burcu Duygan-Bump, and 
William R. Nelson (forthcoming), “Why Do We Need Both Liquidity Regulations and a Lender of Last Resort?  A 
Perspective from Federal Reserve Lending During the 2007–09 U.S. Financial Crisis,” Finance and Economics 
Discussion Papers (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

Consider first a regime in which there is no LOLR and, thus, financial intermediaries are 

left to self-insure against liquidity risk.  Absent regulation, in normal times firms might choose to 

“underhoard” liquidity, to use Jean Tirole’s term.4  As Tirole explains, firms may be incentivized 

to sacrifice some insurance in order to buy more illiquid (and presumably higher-yielding) 

investments.  This choice raises the prospect of huge negative externalities, since each firm may 

hold a smaller buffer than is socially optimal.  Were a liquidity stress to arise, particularly one 

following an asset price shock that broadly affected financial intermediaries, the result could be 

the kind of freezing up of financial system gears that took place a few years ago, with 

consequences for the broader economy that went well beyond the effects on specific markets or 

institutions. 

Assume, then, that regulation is put in place to force intermediaries to internalize all the 

liquidity costs of even the most severe, low-probability systemic events.  Firms would have to 

demonstrate that they either maintained more or less matched durations of their assets and 

liabilities in the steady state or, what in some circumstances could amount to much the same 

thing, have liquidity buffers sufficient to meet all liquidity demands even during a systemic event 

following a major shock to asset values.  Such an approach would entail two major costs.  First, 

such a requirement would significantly constrain the level of liquidity and maturity 

transformation in normal times, surely resulting in significant constraints on credit extension, 

with consequent negative effects on economic growth.  A primary economic function of banks 

and other financial intermediaries is facilitating liquidity management throughout the economy.  

4 Jean Tirole (2011), “Illiquidity and All Its Friends,” Journal of Economic Literature, vol. 49(2), pp. 287–325, at p. 
295.  Tirole introduces the term in a general discussion of firm incentives, not in the context of LOLR (which he 
addresses later).  But the incentives would seem even stronger where LOLR is available. 





- 6 - 
 

Demand deposits and other short-term bank liabilities are safe, easy-to-value claims that are well 

suited for transaction purposes and provide money-like benefits to firms and households.5    

Second, in a world without LOLR, shortages of liquid assets would be exacerbated 

during stress episodes.  Banks would likely hoard their liquidity buffers.  Knowing they must 

rely only on their own liquidity to meet demands even as market uncertainty is increasing and 

asset values suffer downward pressure, banks would have to reduce dramatically their core 

intermediation function.  They would be reluctant to lend to firms and households that are 

themselves subject to the impact of the systemwide liquidity shocks.  These real-economy actors 

would thus be unable to fulfill their own financial obligations in a timely fashion or would pare 

back their own activities out of concern about their ability to do so.  Another adverse feedback 

loop could result.  Even without liquidity regulation and with an LOLR, there is a tendency to 

hoard liquidity during periods of financial instability, as evidenced between 2007 and 2009 when 

banks actually increased their balance sheet liquidity instead of running down their liquidity 

buffers.6   

It is worth noting that this very dynamic helped motivate the creation of the Federal 

Reserve.  If solvent banks are confident that they will be able to borrow from the central bank 

against good collateral to meet any unforeseen funding needs, then they need not completely stop 

lending even amid increased uncertainty about future funding needs.  Lending by the central 

5 Banks also provide liquidity to operating firms via committed lines of credit, which are more efficient, in 
conditions of uncertainty, than an arrangement in which each operating firm attempts to hold sufficient funds in 
advance to meet potential liquidity needs, as discussed in Holmstrom and Tirole (1998), “Private and Public Supply 
of Liquidity,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 106(1), pp. 1–40.  
6 See Carlson, Duygan-Bump, and Nelson (forthcoming).  Mark Carlson (2013) presents evidence that this was also 
a very typical dynamic of liquidity crises historically, when reserve requirements were used to promote bank 
liquidity in the absence of a central bank that could add liquidity to the financial system; see “Lessons from the 
Historical Use of Reserve Requirements in the United States to Promote Bank Liquidity,” Finance and Economics 
Discussion Papers 2013-11 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System).

bank is an essential tool to address liquidity stress and to mitigate--though not eliminate--the 

externalities imposed on the real economy through defensive hoarding by intermediaries.  The 

importance of lending by the central bank is emphasized in much of the economics literature, 

where LOLR is often viewed as the optimal policy tool.7  

Consider now the opposite approach to dealing with liquidity stress, one that relies 

largely on the LOLR function of the central bank.  If the problem with complete reliance on self-

insurance is that firms would ration liquidity too tightly in normal times and hoard it in periods 

of stress, the obvious problem with a readily available LOLR is that firms would maintain only 

the liquidity needed for operations in normal times and do essentially no self-insuring for periods 

of stress.   

Some might argue that this state of affairs is not actually problematic, so long as the 

intermediaries are sufficiently capitalized to remain solvent under stressed circumstances.  The 

theory of LOLR lending rests on institutions being fundamentally solvent.  Central bank 

provision of liquidity is not intended to prop up weak or insolvent institutions.  Rather, the 

objective is to facilitate financial intermediation generally, and maturity transformation in 

particular, by relieving unusual liquidity strains associated with periods of financial stress.  

Indeed, to support their independence and to guard against their engaging in fiscal policy, central 

banks are correctly permitted to take on only a small amount of credit risk.  Thus, most 

advocates of expansive LOLR programs would readily agree with the need for strong capital 

standards, so as to limit the number of occasions on which market participants run because they 

7 For example, Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig (1983) argue that just the presence of the LOLR, without any 
actual lending, can eliminate run-risk altogether, increasing social welfare at zero cost; see “Bank Runs, Deposit 
Insurance, and Liquidity,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 91(3), pp. 401–419.  Similarly, Holmstrom and Tirole 
(1998) show that public provision of liquidity in the presence of aggregate shocks is a pure public good, with no 
moral hazard involved.

question the solvency of a firm, and to provide a solid basis for LOLR extensions of liquidity by 

insulating the central bank from credit risk. 

It is surely important to maintain strong capital standards.  And it is true that the 

prudential supervisory role of a central bank may at times give it greater insight into the balance 

sheet of regulated institutions, such as through well-developed supervisory stress tests.  In 

practice, however, the line between illiquidity and insolvency can be very blurry.  Particularly in 

periods of stress, when the value of important asset classes may be quite volatile and very 

difficult to determine, the central bank cannot always easily disentangle illiquidity and 

insolvency risks. 

For the same reasons that an expansive LOLR can create the risk of central banks 

assuming more than small amounts of credit risk, it can also create moral hazard.  Models in 

economic literature that conclude the socially optimal policy is for the central bank to backstop 

aggregate liquidity risk generally assume that credit risk is negligible (or can be priced perfectly) 

and the only source of risk is that related to liquidity.  In this abstract world, there is no moral 

hazard, at least in the sense that the firm with access to the LOLR will hold an insufficient 

quantity of liquid assets.  This is because all assets are effectively liquid, since the central bank 

can always lend against assets that may be illiquid in private markets.  

Outside the world of theory, however, moral hazard is a significant problem.  The central 

bank will sometimes be asked to lend to a financial institution precisely because its creditors are 

pulling back out of concern that the institution may not be able to meet its obligations.  Even if 

the central bank were appropriately reluctant to increase moral hazard by stepping in for private 

funding when an institution is in fact insolvent, the prospect of a rapid, disorderly default could 

still motivate LOLR lending.  The reasoning would be that central bank lending in such a 




- 9 - 
 

situation could provide a bridge to an acquisition, a more orderly failure, or an internally 

generated recovery of the institution.  Any of these outcomes would forestall fire sales of assets 

or a default that could cascade across the financial system.  But while LOLR lending might be 

the best of a bad set of choices when confronted with those circumstances, those frantic efforts 

are the very situations that pose the highest risk of the central bank taking on mispriced credit 

risk.  The prospect--perhaps even expectation--of such action can foster significant moral hazard.  

While the central bank can, to some extent, control the potential moral hazard by pricing 

credit risk correctly or, more practically, by reducing credit risk close to zero by taking a large 

amount of collateral, this approach could at times actually compound liquidity stress.  If the 

central bank requires so much collateral that the risk to other short-term creditors rises, then 

those creditors have an even greater incentive to run, thereby exacerbating the situation and 

complicating a bankruptcy or orderly liquidation proceeding.  Similarly, if central bank lending 

facilitates exit by the uninsured depositors of a troubled bank, the costs borne by remaining 

creditors or the deposit insurance fund will increase.  Indeed, it is for this reason that the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) placed restrictions on 

discount window lending by the Federal Reserve to undercapitalized banks.8  

Thus, while liquidity regulation should not require self-insurance against low probability, 

severe systemic events, it has an important role to play alongside capital regulation and 

resolution mechanisms in reducing the likelihood of systemic events and making them more 

8 A central bank can also increase liquidity in the financial system by reducing its target interest rate, at least until it 
reaches the zero lower bound.  Like LOLR actions, this may well be the right policy choice when confronted with 
liquidity stress.  Again, though, the potential costs of reliance on interest rate reductions--including risks of 
undesirably high inflation, excessive leverage leading to financial stability concerns, or both--argue for a regime of 
well-considered liquidity regulations.

manageable when they do occur.  It can serve both as a tax and a mitigant to offset the 

externalities associated with liquidity risk.9    

There is an additional role for liquidity regulation, one suggested by much of the 

preceding discussion.  When a firm faces a run on its funding, it is likely either insolvent or in a 

condition that makes an assessment of its solvency difficult for counterparties, investors, and 

regulators.  That is, by this point the capital position of the firm is perceived as sufficiently 

uncertain so as to call into question its continued viability.  Liquidity regulation can ensure that, 

even in these circumstances, officials have at least a bit of time to assess liquidity troubles and 

the underlying condition of the firm, as well as the degree to which the troubles are idiosyncratic 

or systemic.  With appropriate insolvency mechanisms available, authorities can then decide 

whether the firm will recover or needs to be placed into a resolution or liquidation regime, while 

proceeding in a manner consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act injunction that LOLR measures in 

exigent circumstances are not to be used for the benefit of a single firm. 

This is not to say that everything will always proceed smoothly, of course.  But such an 

approach can extend the proverbial runway for a troubled firm and help avoid repeats of the 

situation six years ago, when policymakers confronted with chaotic financial conditions had little 

time to react and few available tools other than government liquidity and, eventually, capital 

injections.

After a somewhat lengthy gestation period, there has been considerable recent progress 

on measures that reflect the role for liquidity regulation I have just described.  The U.S. banking 

agencies have worked with other regulators in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to 

develop two quantitative liquidity standards--the LCR and the NSFR.  These standards 

complement the bank capital framework and resolution mechanisms that have been agreed 

internationally.  They will also help central banks limit the use of LOLR.  In addition, as I have 

previously noted, the Federal Reserve is working on a proposal to tie risk-based capital 

surcharges for each U.S. global systemically important bank (G-SIB) to that G-SIB’s reliance on 

short-term wholesale funding.10  Together, these standards are designed to mitigate the risks 

associated with banks’ reliance on unstable funding structures and to encourage them to embrace 

more resilient funding models.  

Under the LCR, banking organizations11 must hold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets 

sufficient to cover net cash outflows during a 30-day stress scenario.  This requirement serves 

several of the purposes discussed earlier.  A buffer of high-quality liquid assets is a form of self-

insurance against liquidity risk that allows banks to meet short-term needs in the event of 

creditor runs.  Because holding the buffer is likely to be somewhat costly, the LCR should also 

encourage banks to reduce use of very short-term wholesale funding that increases buffer 

requirements.  The buffer will also provide central banks and other national authorities time to 

assess the financial condition of a firm encountering liquidity difficulties and to determine the

Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, September 9,

11 Under the U.S. rule implementing the LCR, the LCR would apply to banking organizations with total 
consolidated assets of $250 billion or more or total consolidated on-balance-sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion 
or more.  In addition, a simpler, less stringent version of the LCR would apply to other banking organizations with 
$50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.  LCR requirements would not apply to banking organizations with 
total assets of less than $50 billion.

extent to which these difficulties are a function of essentially firm-specific factors or a harbinger 

of market-wide funding stress.    

A revised version of the NSFR has recently been released by the Basel Committee.12  It 

complements the LCR by looking beyond a 30-day period to achieve a stable funding profile for 

firms more generally.  In this regard, it is important to recall that the deterioration of funding 

markets began well before the financial crisis reached its acute stages.  In the summer of 2007, 

responding to signs of trouble in the subprime mortgage markets, creditors reduced the maturities 

of funding they were willing to provide to financial intermediaries that had been creating and 

holding securities backed by subprime--and eventually other--mortgages.13  This process left 

those intermediaries in increasingly fragile funding positions, and by the time Lehman Brothers 

collapsed in September 2008, the system was primed for a devastating run.  Given the possibility 

of this type of sustained erosion of firm funding structures over an extended period, simply 

requiring firms to hold a liquidity buffer against 30-day outflows, as required by the LCR, would 

be insufficient. 

 While there is thus a need for a longer-term structural standard such as the NSFR, the 

conceptual challenges in crafting it were greater than in designing the LCR.  Simply extending 

the LCR to one-year--that is, requiring firms to hold enough liquidity to survive a one-year 

funding market freeze--seemed the kind of excessive self-insurance that would lead to 

undesirably reduced maturity transformation and financial intermediation.  So a different set of 

standards needed to be developed, which themselves occasioned considerable discussion about 

the effects and incentives they would create.  Also, one could argue that the NSFR should have

aimed for a more complete term structure in order to protect against maturity mismatches within 

and beyond the one-year mark, and to create stronger incentives for firms to extend the maturity 

of their funding arrangements.   

 Considerable attention was paid to these and other concerns during the consultative and 

deliberative processes in the Basel Committee.  As I mentioned earlier, the seriousness with 

which central bankers and regulatory agencies took these concerns is evidenced by the fact that 

the NSFR was subject to considerable revision over the last four years.  I anticipate we will hear 

similar, and perhaps additional concerns, from a variety of perspectives when the federal banking 

agencies issue a proposed rule next year to implement the NSFR in the United States.  This 

process should result in a regulation that reduces the probability of banks coming under short-

term funding pressures.  Maintaining more stable funding, such as retail deposits and term 

funding with maturities of greater than six months, will help avoid the spiral of fire sales of 

illiquid assets that deplete capital and exacerbate market stress. 

Unlike the LCR--and the originally finalized version of the Basel NSFR--the newly 

finalized NSFR also begins to address the risks associated with matched books of securities 

financing transactions.  On its face, a perfectly matched book might seem to pose little risk to the 

firm, since it could run off assets as it lost funding.  In reality, however, a firm may be reluctant 

to proceed in so symmetrical a fashion.  In such a context, “running off assets” may mean 

denying needed funding to clients with which the firm has a valuable relationship.  Moreover, 

even if the firm does run off assets, a firm with a large matched book will almost surely be 

creating liquidity squeezes for these other market actors.  To partially address these risks, the 

NSFR will require firms to hold some stable funding against short-term loans to financial firms. 




- 14 - 
 

Under the enhancement of the international G-SIB surcharge being developed by the 

Federal Reserve, the formula used to set risk-based capital surcharge levels for U.S. G-SIBs 

would incorporate each U.S. G-SIB’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding.  Greater reliance 

on short-term wholesale funding leaves firms more vulnerable to runs that impose externalities 

on the entire financial system.  Requiring higher capital levels at such firms will improve their 

chances of maintaining access to market funding in periods of stress by providing greater 

assurance of their solvency to counterparties. 

The LCR and NSFR developed in the Basel Committee are path-breaking measures that 

create quantitative liquidity requirements.  Still, they do not fully cover all facets of liquidity 

risk.  We are trying to address those residual risks in two ways--first, by adding certain 

requirements in our domestic implementation of the international standards and, second, through 

our supervisory program. 

As to augmenting the international standards, let me give two examples.  First, the Basel 

LCR does not impose any regulatory charge on a bank’s use of overnight funding to fund assets 

that mature in less than 30 days.  This lacuna leaves open the possibility of a significant maturity 

mismatch within the 30-day LCR window.  The U.S. LCR fills this gap by imposing a regulatory 

charge on maturity mismatch within the 30-day period.14  Second, because the Basel LCR and 

the NSFR each calculate the liquidity position of a firm on a fully consolidated basis, neither 

adequately addresses the risk that stress could occur in one part of the organization while the 

liquidity needed to deal with that stress is trapped in another.  In the U.S. LCR, a holding 

14 While the original version of the NSFR had a similar shortcoming, the newly finalized version partially redresses 
that problem by giving banks an incentive to reduce maturity mismatches within the one-year window.  More 
specifically, the NSFR now allows firms to recognize as stable funding 50 percent of certain liabilities with a 
residual maturity between six months and one year, including funding from central banks and financial institutions, 
and requires them to hold some stable funding against most assets that mature in under one year.

company may include in its consolidated liquidity buffer only qualifying assets held by a 

subsidiary U.S. bank that are in excess of the amount of the projected net cash outflows of the 

subsidiary bank and that can be transferred to the holding company without statutory, regulatory, 

supervisory, or contractual restrictions.  The Federal Reserve has also adopted rules requiring 

certain foreign banking organizations (FBOs) with large U.S. operations to hold financial 

resources in the United States commensurate with their U.S. liquidity risk.15       

Supervisory programs are also being used to supplement the Basel measures, in a manner 

roughly comparable to our practice in the area of capital regulation.  The very nature of 

quantitative liquidity standards means the effectiveness of the rules could wane over time 

because of changes in funding markets, reductions in the liquidity of assets previously deemed 

liquid, or regulatory arbitrage.  Furthermore, it is difficult for any standardized quantitative 

liquidity regulation to capture all relevant risks.  For instance, a bank’s short-term funding can be 

more or less stable depending on the structural characteristics of a firm’s funding providers.   

The LCR distinguishes between broad categories of funding counterparties, such as financial 

institutions and non-financial companies.  But it does not differentiate in a more granular way 

among entities that may behave very differently under stress, such as traditional banks and 

money market mutual funds.16      

15 FBOs with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more must meet liquidity risk-management standards and 
conduct internal liquidity stress tests.  An FBO’s U.S. intermediate holding company must maintain a liquidity 
buffer in the United States based on the results of a 30-day liquidity stress test.  The U.S. branches and agencies of 
an FBO must maintain a liquidity buffer in the United States equal to the liquidity needs for 14 days, as determined 
by an internal liquidity stress test.  In addition, the Board has indicated that it intends to apply the Basel III liquidity 
rules to large U.S. operations of FBOs.  These requirements are comparable to local liquidity requirements imposed 
by the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority, although the authority’s branch-level liquidity 
requirements are somewhat more flexible. 
16 Similarly, the effective liquidity of short-term loans that a bank may count as an inflow under the LCR is in part 
dependent on the nature of the bank’s relationship with the borrower.  A bank’s liquidity risk-management 
framework should recognize that, even under stress, it may be reluctant to refuse to roll over short-term credit to 
customers that it would like to retain in the longer run. 





- 16 - 
 

To complement the LCR and NSFR, in 2012 the Federal Reserve launched the 

Comprehensive Liquidity Assessment and Review (CLAR) for firms in the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC) portfolio.17  Like the Comprehensive Capital 

Analysis and Review (CCAR), CLAR is an annual horizontal assessment, with quantitative and 

qualitative elements, overseen by a multidisciplinary committee of liquidity experts from across 

the Federal Reserve.  In CLAR, supervisors assess the adequacy of LISCC portfolio firms’ 

liquidity positions relative to their unique risks and test the reliability of these firms’ approaches 

to managing liquidity risk.  CLAR provides a regular opportunity for supervisors to respond to 

evolving liquidity risks and firm practices over time.  

CLAR involves evaluations of firms’ liquidity positions both through a range of 

supervisory liquidity metrics and through analysis of firms’ internal stress tests.  A variety of 

liquidity indicators, such as funding concentrations, measure vulnerabilities beyond those 

captured in the LCR; the measurements are made over a number of time horizons.  In parallel to 

this quantitative assessment, supervisors also examine the stress tests that each firm uses to make 

funding decisions and to determine its liquidity needs.  Recent CLAR work on the firms’ own 

stress testing practices has focused, among other issues, on assumptions regarding liquidity needs 

for capital markets activity, such as prime brokerage services and derivatives trading.  As with 

CCAR, this analysis helps inform supervisors of the reliability of firms’ own risk measurement 

and management.     

Though similar to CCAR in some respects, CLAR does not include a specific quantitative 

post-stress minimum.  Of course, LISCC firms will be required to meet the LCR, which is itself a

forward-looking requirement for a buffer against a potential stress on liquidity.  In addition, 

firms with weak liquidity positions under CLAR’s liquidity metrics are directed to improve their 

practices and, as warranted, their liquidity positions, through supervisory direction, ratings 

downgrades, or enforcement actions.  Because CLAR assesses all LISCC firms simultaneously, 

the Federal Reserve is also able to compare the range of practices in liquidity risk management 

across the portfolio.  Qualitative deficiencies identified in CLAR, such as questionable internal 

stress testing regimes, are addressed through the same set of supervisory tools.  Knowledge 

gained through CLAR assessments also provides a macroprudential perspective on liquidity 

vulnerabilities and funding concentrations in the system as a whole.   

An Interim Appraisal of Liquidity Regulation 

The financial crisis revealed the need for prudential regulation to consider systemic 

vulnerabilities, as well as weaknesses in traditional regulation aimed at assuring the financial 

condition of individual firms.  Both microprudential and macroprudential shortcomings were 

never as apparent as in the series of runs and general funding stress that defined much of the 

crisis.  Today, as I hope I have adequately explained, we have a better appreciation for the role 

liquidity regulation should play in tandem with capital regulation and resolution mechanisms, 

and as a means for both complementing and limiting the LOLR function of central banks.  We 

are well along the road of implementing regulatory and supervisory policies to play that role.  

Even though these measures are in some cases still under development and in others still being 

phased in, the liquidity positions and management practices of LISCC firms have improved 

considerably over the past few years.  Since 2012, the LISCC firms’ combined buffer of high-

quality liquid assets has increased by about a third, and their reliance on short-term wholesale 

funding has dropped considerably.

Despite this progress, and perhaps to some degree because of it, important issues remain.  

Liquidity regulation is still a relatively new undertaking, certainly in its present form that 

includes quantitative requirements.18  There is still need for conceptual work on such questions 

as how to specify the extent to which banks should be required to self-insure against liquidity 

risk by maintaining larger liquidity buffers and more closely matching assets with liabilities, and 

how to define the circumstances in which central banks should provide liquidity.   

It is also clear that liquidity regulation has the potential to generate unintended effects.  

For example, in periods of stress firms are likely to have multiple incentives to hoard 

accumulated liquidity, rather than to use it to relieve the funding needs of households and other 

firms.  The upshot would be to exacerbate systemic strains and cause a reduction in economic 

activity.  This tendency toward liquidity hoarding may be amplified by the very fact of 

quantitative liquidity requirements, since firms may fear that dipping below those levels even in 

a period of stress would project weakness to counterparties, investors, and market analysts.  That 

is, we may be more successful in enforcing the maintenance of liquid asset buffers in normal 

times for use in stress periods than we will be in encouraging their use when such a stress period 

arrives. 

For this reason we are working on a supervisory approach in which the remedy for falling 

below regulatory thresholds is context dependent.  That is, a firm that falls out of compliance 

with the LCR or NSFR during a period of generalized stress should not be subject to automatic 

18 Although, in recent decades, reserve requirements have been used to establish a stable demand for reserves for 
monetary policy implementation purposes, they were a form of liquidity requirement historically.  As originally 
constructed, they were a substantial percentage of a bank’s liability base and were intended (at least in part) to 
ensure that banks could meet their obligations in a timely fashion.  (Some variations even distinguished between 
stable and volatile deposits, looking at turnover of different types of deposits to calibrate the appropriate reserve 
ratio.)

sanctions, but instead given an opportunity to come back into compliance in a way that does not 

expose either the firm or the system to greater stress.   

Finally, the very progress made in regulating liquidity at large firms may raise a new set 

of regulatory arbitrage problems.  Short-term wholesale funding markets are generally smaller 

today than before the crisis, the average maturity of short-term funding arrangements is 

moderately greater, and collateral haircuts are more conservative.  Yet volumes are still large 

relative to the size of the financial system.  Furthermore, some of the factors that account for the 

reduction in short-term wholesale funding volumes, such as the unusually flat yield curve 

environment and lingering risk aversion from the crisis, are likely to prove transitory.  And, 

while prudentially regulated dealers will continue to play a central role as intermediaries in short-

term funding markets, post-crisis reforms directed at the regulated sector could lead to the 

disintermediation of regulated entities over time.  Financial, technological, and regulatory 

barriers to disintermediation of regulated financial firms could likely be overcome with time and 

sufficient economic incentive.   

During normal times, short-term wholesale funding can help to satisfy investor demand 

for safe and liquid investments, lower funding costs for borrowers, and support the functioning 

of important markets, including those in which monetary policy is executed.  But during periods 

of stress, runs by providers of short-term wholesale funding and associated asset liquidations can 

result in large fire-sale externalities and otherwise undermine financial stability.  To the extent 

that disintermediation of prudentially regulated firms occurs, there will be a need to supplement 

prudential bank regulation with policy options that can be applied on a market-wide basis, such 

as a framework of minimum margin requirements for securities financing transactions.  Last 

month, the Financial Stability Board finalized minimum margin requirements for non-centrally-

cleared securities financing transactions in which a bank or broker-dealer extends credit to an 

unregulated entity against non-sovereign collateral.  The Financial Stability Board has also 

proposed to extend the framework to cover transactions among unregulated entities.19  

Implementation of this initiative will be a first, important step to ensuring that better 

regulation of the liquidity positions of regulated firms does not result in the migration of run 

risks to the shadow banking system.  We will need to monitor developments in order to assess 

whether further action is needed to consolidate the progress we have made in promoting financial 

stability.
