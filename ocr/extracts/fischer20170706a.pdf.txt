I want to talk tonight about labor productivity growth.  Labor productivity is the 

amount of goods and services produced per hour spent on the job.  Increases in labor 

productivity--again, that’s the amount of goods and services produced per hour on the 

job--are a fundamental factor in determining how fast the economy grows, and how fast 

the average standard of living grows.  And productivity growth can be influenced by 

government policy, about which I also want to say a few words.1   

Labor productivity growth varies a lot from year to year, but it is possible to 

discern longer historical periods with high or low productivity growth, as shown in 

figure 1.  For example, labor productivity rose at an average annual rate of 3-1/4 percent 

from 1948 to 1973, whereas in the period 1974 to 2016, the average growth rate of 

productivity was about 1.7 percent.  That is to say that, with the important exception of 

the information technology (IT) boom beginning in the mid-1990s, the U.S. economy has 

been in a low-productivity growth period since 1974.  The record for the past five years 

has been particularly dismal.   

How much does productivity growth matter?  A great deal.  The person who made 

that clear, in an article published in 1957, 60 years ago, Professor Robert Solow, is here 

tonight.  That is a pleasure, an honor, a joy, and something of a difficulty for anyone 

wanting to talk about productivity and its growth in the presence of the master.   

The reason the rate of productivity growth matters so much is that it is a basic 

determinant of the rate of growth of average income per capita over long periods.2  To 

                                                 
1 I am grateful to David Byrne of the Federal Reserve Board for his assistance.  Views expressed in this 
presentation are my own and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open 
Market Committee. 
2 One needs also to recognize that changes in either the average workweek or the employment to population 
ratio may damp or augment the effect of labor productivity on GDP per capita.

understand that one needs to know only the trick of calculating how long it takes for a 

growing economy to double.  A good rule of thumb for calculating the time it takes labor 

productivity (or anything else that is growing) to double can be calculated by dividing 70 

by the growth rate.  When labor productivity was growing at 3-1/4 percent per 

year--during the 25 years from 1948 to 1973--it took 22 years for labor productivity to 

double.  Looking again at Figure 1, in the 42 years from 1974 to 2016, when labor 

productivity was growing on average at a rate of 1-3/4 percent, it would have taken 

approximately 41 years for labor productivity to double.  There is a vast difference 

between the prospects facing the young in an economy where incomes per capita are 

doubling every 22 years and an economy in which incomes are on average doubling only 

every 41 years.   

Now, productivity statistics are imperfect in many respects--for example, 

capturing the value of the seemingly free apps we use on our smartphones is challenging.    

And many of us who live in the modern age cannot believe that the iPhone has not 

fundamentally changed our lives.  It has certainly changed our lives to some extent, and 

there is likely some underestimation of productivity growth in the official data.  But to 

figure out whether the current degree of data bias has reduced estimated growth, we have 

to ask not whether there is bias, but whether the bias has increased.  To a first 

approximation, one could assume that the rate of bias is constant, and does not account 

for the estimated decline in productivity growth and that we should not dismiss the 

slowdown as an artifact of measurement difficulties3  That is the conclusion most 

researchers reach, but the data issue is not settled.  As Bob Solow famously said, just 

                                                 
3 Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) discuss known measurement challenges and conclude they cannot 
explain the deceleration of productivity.

before the increase in productivity growth of 1996-2003, “the computer is everywhere 

except in the growth data.”  And there are serious researchers who have made serious 

arguments that we will soon be seeing more rapid growth in the productivity data.   

Factors determining productivity growth 

Clearly, a key question for economic forecasters, and even more so for U.S. 

citizens, and indeed for the entire global economy, is whether we should anticipate a 

return of the more rapid productivity gains experienced in the IT boom and for the 

quarter century after the end of World War II, or should instead resign ourselves to tepid 

economic growth in future years.  And a central policy issue is whether government 

policies can help push the economy toward a higher-productivity regime.   

In this context, it is useful to think of labor productivity growth as coming from 

three sources, as shown in figure 2.  First, greater investment by firms in tangible 

equipment and structures, as well as “intangible” investments such as software and 

product designs, raise labor productivity.  Second, improvements in labor quality, or the 

capabilities of the workforce, contribute as well--through education, training, and 

experience.  Finally, innovations yield more or better output from the same inputs--the 

same capital and labor--such as the introduction of the assembly line and computer-aided 

product design.  I will consider the role that policy may play through each of these 

channels.  It is noteworthy that most of the recent drop in productivity is due to a lower 

contribution from innovation, although weaker investment has played a role as well.  The 

contribution to labor productivity from labor quality has changed very little.

Innovation 

Our prospects for further significant technological innovations are hotly debated.  

Some observers believe that we have exhausted the low-hanging fruit on the productivity 

tree and, in particular, that efficiency gains from the use of IT have run their course.4  

Other observers argue that we can reach fruit higher on the tree with each passing year.  

These observers believe that innovation yields better tools, such as 3-D printers and 

genetic sequencing equipment, which themselves enable further technological advances.5  

For what it is worth, I believe the early signs of self-driving cars, the emergence of 

disease treatments based on genetics, and the falling costs for conventional and 

alternative energy production suggest that we are continuing to innovate, both in IT as 

well as in other parts of the economy.  One possibility is that we are in a productivity lull 

while firms reorganize to exploit the latest innovations; it took decades before the full 

benefits of the steam engine, electrification, and computers were seen.6 

One way to ensure the vigor of innovation is to support research and development 

(R&D), and here the recent record is mixed.  As shown in figure 3, R&D spending in the 

United States softened during the Great Recession.  R&D funded by U.S. businesses has 

since recovered.  However, government-funded R&D as a share of gross domestic 

product is at the lowest level in recent history.  A great deal of the “R” in overall R&D is 

                                                 
4 Gordon (2014, p. 25) enumerates the inventions of the information age--the personal computer, the 
Internet, mobile phones, and so on--and notes that for innovation to continue at such a pace, “the 
achievements of the past 40 years set a hurdle that is dauntingly high.” 
5 Mokyr (2014, p. 83) considers advances in research methods and tools and concludes that “the indirect 
effects of science on productivity through the tools it provides scientific research may dwarf the direct 
effects in the long run.” 
6 David (1990) cautions that the effect of general-purpose technologies, such as electricity and electronic 
computing, can take decades to fully unfold.  Brynjolfsson and Hitt (2000) consider the process followed 
by firms in leveraging innovations in IT equipment and emphasize the role of complementary investment in 
intangible assets like business reorganization.

government funded and not tied to a specific commercial goal.  The applied research built 

on this basic research ultimately yields productivity gains far into the future.7  

Consequently, the decline in government-funded R&D is disturbing. 

To raise productivity and economic well-being, firms must adopt innovations that 

emerge from R&D as quickly as possible.  This adjustment may occur as start-ups 

introduce innovation to the market, as existing innovative firms expand, or as competing 

firms imitate the innovators.  Recent research suggests that all three of these channels, 

which reflect the economic dynamism of businesses, have been operating sluggishly of 

late:  New firms are not created as often as in the past, innovative firms are not hiring or 

investing as aggressively as they once did, and the diffusion of innovations is weak from 

frontier firms to trailing firms.8   

It is difficult to pinpoint specific policy actions that would address this decline in 

dynamism.  Broadly speaking, however, government policymakers should carefully 

consider the effects of regulations and tax policy on the free flow of workers, capital, and 

ideas. 

Investment 

In recent years, the contribution to labor productivity growth from investment has 

declined.  Business fixed investment rose roughly 2-1/2 percent per year, on average, 

from 2004 to 2016, compared with about 5 percent from 1996 to 2003.9  Some bright 

                                                 
7  Mohnen and Hall (2013) survey the empirical literature pointing to a link between R&D and 
productivity. 
8 Decker and others (2016) highlight the decline in entrepreneurship and worker mobility; Andrews, 
Criscuolo, and Gal (2015) emphasizes that productivity for firms at the global frontier continues to advance 
rapidly even as global aggregate productivity growth has slowed. 
9 Pinto and Tevlin (2014) note that in the context of a long-run growth model, a slow pace of investment is 
not surprising in light of the slow growth in effective labor inputs--which equals the sum of labor quality 
and total factor productivity growth.  Fernald and others (2017) raise a related point--the ratio of capital to 


 - 6 - 

spots do exist:  Capital expenditure by leading IT companies--Google, Amazon, and the 

like--has soared since 2010, and investment in the energy sector has returned to life.  

Nevertheless, firms as a whole seem reluctant to invest. 

This cautious approach to investment may in part reflect uncertainty about the 

policy environment.  By one measure, U.S. policy uncertainty was elevated for much of 

the recovery, subsided in 2013, and then rose again late last year, underpinned by 

uncertainty about policies associated with health care, regulation, taxes, and trade.10  

Reasonable people can disagree about the right way forward on each of those issues, but 

mitigating the damping effect of uncertainty by providing more clarity on the future 

direction of government policy is highly desirable--particularly if the direction of policy 

itself is desirable.   

Government investment can be an important source of productivity growth as 

well.  For example, the interstate highway system is credited with boosting productivity 

in the 1950s and 1960s.11  That highway system and many other federally supported 

roadways, waterways, and structures have been neglected in recent years.  Indeed, real 

infrastructure spending (that is, adjusting for inflation) has fallen nearly 1 percent per 

year since 2005.12  This area of government investment deserves more attention. 

                                                 
output has returned to its apparent long-run trend.  That said, Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2017) argue that 
the recent rapid declines in the price of IT capital may presage an uptick in investment in response. 
10 As discussed in Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2012), the Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) index, 
available on the EPU website at www.policyuncertainty.com, is constructed from component measures for 
references to policy uncertainty in major newspapers, the number of tax code provisions set to expire in 
future years, and disagreement among economic forecasters. 
11 See Fernald (1999). 
12 Although the share of nominal public spending devoted to infrastructure in recent years has been similar 
to the share dating back to the 1980s, Congressional Budget Office (2015) notes that real spending has been 
held down by the relatively rapid increase in the price of inputs used for construction.

Labor Quality 

Also important to raising labor productivity is investment in human capital--

workers’ knowledge and skills.  Such investment is a particular issue because most 

forecasts anticipate that the long rise in educational attainment--both for college and high 

school--may soon come to an end.  One area where policy may play a role is promoting 

educational access and readiness for groups for whom educational attainment is relatively 

low. 

Recent research has shown a substantial return to public investment in early 

childhood education for economically disadvantaged groups.  Such programs increase 

high school graduation, promote income over the life cycle for both participants and their 

parents, and produce other socially beneficial outcomes, such as greater health. 13   

At the other end of the education process, a college degree has long been 

considered a worthwhile investment, and thus our society should promote access to and 

readiness for college among a broad range of individuals--in particular through federal 

support for need-based financial aid.14 

Lastly, I will note that ultimately the return on the human capital embodied in our 

workforce is closely tied to public health.  A rise in morbidity or fall in longevity in the 

U.S. population is not a concern only for humanitarian reasons.  Workers too ill to 

perform at their potential represent lost productivity and welfare for society as a whole.  

Research has shown just such a trend among prime-age non-Hispanic Americans without 

                                                 
13 Research on the effect of early childhood education is surveyed in Elango and others (2015).  Garcia and 
others (2017) consider the effect over the full life cycle of an early childhood program targeting 
disadvantaged families and estimate an internal rate of return of nearly 14 percent. 
14 Dynarski and Scott-Clayton (2013) review the evidence that college enrollment rates are positively 
affected by student aid.

a college degree.15  More study is needed to determine what policies would help reverse 

this trend, and government funding could likely assist the effort.  More broadly, programs 

to promote clean air and drinking water are examples of public health policies that bolster 

the health and longevity of the present and future workforce as a whole. 

Concluding remarks 

To conclude, we return to the basic question:  How much does productivity 

growth matter?  The basic answer: simple arithmetic says it matters a lot.  If labor 

productivity grows an average of 2 percent per year, average living standards for our 

children’s generation will be twice what we experienced.  If labor productivity grows an 

average of 1 percent per year, the difference is dramatic:  Living standards will take two 

generations to double.16   

But fortunately, when it comes to productivity, we are not simply consigned to 

luck or to fate.  Governments can take sensible actions to promote more rapid 

productivity growth.  Broadly speaking, government policy works best when it can 

address a need that the private sector neglects, including investment in basic research, 

infrastructure, early childhood education, schooling, and public health.  Reasonable 

people can disagree about the right way forward, but if we as a society are to succeed, we 

need to follow policies that will support and advance productivity growth.  That is easier 

said than done.  But it can be done.   


                                                 
15 See Case and Deaton (2017). 
16 To be precise, this illustrative calculation assumes that the average workweek and the employment-to-
population ratio are unchanged.
