market-based economics and entrepreneurship.

annually.  The program offers an intensive six-week classroom curriculum, followed by a 

capstone day at the Finance Park where students participate in a practical personal 

budgeting simulation.  This experiential facility helps students build financial skills that 

are essential to a successful financial future.  Students immerse themselves in reality-

based decisionmaking.  They practice essential household skills by developing a budget 

that includes housing, transportation, food, utilities, health care, investments, 

philanthropy, and banking.  The opportunity will enable them to better navigate real-life 

decisions. 

I applaud the ongoing partnership among Junior Achievement, schools, and 

businesses in the greater Washington area.  As states and school districts around the
