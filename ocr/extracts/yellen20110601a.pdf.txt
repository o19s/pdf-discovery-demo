 Let me begin by thanking Governor Shirakawa and the Bank of Japan for inviting me to 

participate in this important conference on linkages among monetary policy, financial markets, 

and the real economy.  The severe economic consequences of the recent financial crisis have 

underscored the need for central banks to vigilantly monitor the financial system for emerging 

risks to financial stability.  Indeed, such vigilance may be particularly important when monetary 

policy remains highly accommodative for an extended period.  As many observers have argued, 

an environment of low and stable interest rates may encourage investor behavior that could 

potentially lead to the emergence of financial imbalances that could threaten financial stability.1   

 Monetary policy in the United States has been highly accommodative now for a number 

of years.  Since late 2008, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has kept the target 

federal funds rate close to zero and has purchased a substantial amount of longer-term Treasury 

and agency securities.  My reading of the evidence is that those securities purchases have proven 

effective in easing financial conditions, thereby promoting a stronger pace of economic recovery 

and checking undesirable disinflationary pressures.  Moreover, I believe that the current 

accommodative stance of U.S. monetary policy continues to be appropriate because the 

unemployment rate remains elevated and inflation is expected to remain subdued over the 

medium run.     

 Today, I will describe some of the surveillance practices that the Federal Reserve has put 

in place to monitor risks to financial stability, particularly risks stemming from potential 

interactions between a run-up in asset prices and leverage, and I will offer our perspective on the 

current financial situation.  At present, we see few indications of significant imbalances, despite 

some recent developments warranting close attention, including signs of valuation pressures in

some markets and a moderate increase in leverage provided by dealers.  I will also briefly touch 

on the role of supervision and regulation in this context and the development of new 

macroprudential tools for addressing financial imbalances. 

Monetary Policy and Financial Imbalances 

 In the aftermath of the crisis, the primary objective of U.S. monetary policy was to 

promote financial conditions likely to spur spending on goods and services through a number of 

channels.  To this end, the Federal Reserve first lowered the federal funds rate and other rates at 

the short end of the yield curve and, once the zero lower bound was binding, sought to push 

down yields at the longer end through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury and agency 

securities.  We anticipated that lowering rates on these securities would place downward pressure 

on a range of private yields as well, in turn supporting home values, equity prices, and other asset 

prices.  After all, this is the primary mechanism through which monetary policy in its 

conventional form stimulates the economy.  But a sustained period of very low and stable yields 

may incent a phenomenon commonly referred to as “reaching for yield,” in which investors seek 

higher returns by purchasing assets with greater duration or increased credit risk.   

The shift toward riskier assets is a normal channel through which monetary policy 

supports economic activity.  But taken too far, this dynamic has the potential to facilitate the 

emergence of financial imbalances.  For example, with interest rates at very low levels for a long 

period of time, and in an environment of low volatility, investors, banks, and other market 

participants may become complacent about interest rate risk.2  Similarly, in such an environment, 

                                                            
2 In January 2010, financial regulators issued an interagency advisory to remind financial institutions about 
supervisory expectations regarding sound practices for the management of interest rate risk. Regulators noted that in 
an environment of historically low short-term interest rates, it is important for institutions to have robust processes 
for measuring and, where necessary, mitigating their exposure to potential increases in interest rates.  See Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation (2010), “Interagency 
Advisory on Interest Rate Risk,” Supervision and Regulation Letter SR 10-1 (January 11), 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/srletters/sr1001.htm.

investors holding assets which entail exposure to greater credit risk may not fully appreciate, or 

demand proper compensation for, potential losses.  Finally, investors may seek to boost returns 

by employing additional leverage, which can amplify interest rate and credit risk as well as make 

exposures less transparent. 

 One of the lessons of the financial crisis was that the potential adverse effects of a rapid 

unwinding of financial imbalances, regardless of the causes, are significantly increased if market 

participants employ significant leverage.  In the extreme, changes in investor sentiment can lead 

to a withdrawal of liquidity, rapid declines in mark-to-market values, forced asset sales in the 

face of margin calls, and, ultimately, a rapid and disorderly self-reinforcing deleveraging.  Such 

painful outcomes are more likely when financing mechanisms are opaque, when intermediation 

occurs without an effective liquidity backstop, when assets are less liquid, and when financial 

leverage is layered on top of structural leverage.3 

These dynamics were evident during the financial crisis.  Before the crisis, market 

participants grew comfortable with borrowing collateralized by a variety of less-liquid assets, 

sometimes using structured investment vehicles (SIVs), conduits, and other off-balance-sheet 

structures.  Directly or indirectly, market participants used short-term funding that needed to be 

renewed almost continually but lacked a formal liquidity backstop (although, in some cases, such 

support was seen by market participants as implicit).  Further, much of the financing--through 

repurchase agreements (repos), over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, and other mechanisms--was 

collateralized by securities that already embedded significant structural leverage.   

This layering of leverage had profound consequences when sentiment changed.  Lenders 

who had financed securities, either directly in the repo market or through structured vehicles,

small changes in risk factors.

were suddenly no longer comfortable with the collateral and were unsure of their potential 

exposure to losses.  Given the uncertainties, the rational response went beyond raising haircuts or 

other means of tightening credit terms:  Banks simply stopped lending, typically by not “rolling 

over,” or renewing, short-term financing when trades matured.  In addition, collateralized 

borrowing had taken on many transactional forms, including OTC derivatives or securities 

financings, which were not always recognized as economically equivalent.  Given the extent of 

layering, and sometimes opacity of leverage, the result was a rapid and disorderly unwinding, 

over just weeks or months, of a very complicated system that had taken years to evolve.  

Assessing Current Financial Imbalances 

In light of this experience, the Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring financial 

indicators for signs of potential imbalances and is assessing the extent to which leverage is 

currently employed by investors, particularly where some of the potentially amplifying factors I 

just discussed may be present. 

Asset Valuations 

Misaligned asset prices are notoriously difficult to detect in a timely fashion, and no 

single metric or set of metrics can consistently and reliably identify stretched valuations.  

Nonetheless, it is clearly worthwhile to track a wide range of metrics and to view them in the 

context of their historical norms.  Current conditions can be evaluated against a baseline of past 

experience, and then assessed in light of the various institutional and market factors that could 

conceivably account for deviations from historical ranges.  The Federal Reserve tracks a large 

number of indicators, and I will highlight a few examples.  

Overall, these indicators do not obviously point to significant excesses or imbalances in 

the United States.  For example, as shown in figure 1, forward price-to-earnings ratios in the 


- 5 - 
 

 
 

stock market fall within the ranges prevailing in recent decades, and are well below the early-

2000 peak, although corresponding measures for small-cap equities (not shown) appear 

somewhat elevated.  In the residential real estate market, price-to-rent ratios are now somewhat 

below their long-run averages, in sharp contrast with the situation immediately before the 

financial crisis.   

Notwithstanding this general view, some areas warrant our ongoing attention.  As shown 

in figure 2, credit spreads on nonfinancial corporate bonds have dropped sharply since the 

financial crisis.  This decline partly reflects improvements in earnings and corporate balance 

sheets, but also lower risk premiums.  One measure of risk premiums, the forward spreads far in 

the future, are extremely low compared with historical norms for high-yield bonds, suggesting 

that investors have become more willing to assume credit risk.  In the syndicated leveraged loan 

market, strong inflows appear to have contributed to an increase in prices.  I will return to 

developments in this market and discuss their potential ramifications shortly. 

Rapid debt growth may also signal emerging imbalances.  In recent quarters, issuance of 

high-yield bonds by nonfinancial corporations has been robust.  As shown in figure 3, credit 

flows have also been solid in the syndicated leveraged loan market, with a substantial amount of 

this credit being ultimately provided by nonbank institutional investors such as loan mutual 

funds, pension funds and insurance companies.  Nonetheless, a portion of the recent corporate 

issuance has been used to refinance existing debt, and small business lending remains quite 

weak.  Overall, despite a recent pickup in commercial and industrial lending, we see little 

evidence that financial institutions are significantly expanding the level of private credit, on net.  

Of course, these aggregate measures provide only a limited picture of overall credit 

conditions.  Another type of evidence comes from surveys of market participants’ practices.  For 


- 6 - 
 

 
 

example, the Federal Reserve’s Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices 

provides information about changes in the supply of and demand for bank loans to businesses 

and households.4  As shown in figure 4, recent surveys indicate that banks have reversed only a 

portion of the substantial tightening in credit standards and terms put in place after the crisis.  

Dealer-Intermediated Leverage 

In the wake of the crisis, the Federal Reserve has intensified its efforts to monitor 

leverage, particularly outside of the traditional banking system.  Information on the use of 

leverage is incomplete at best, and in our attempts to better measure leverage, we must grapple 

with several complexities.  For instance, in recent years a significant volume of credit 

intermediation has migrated outside the traditional banking system, where it is not only 

unprotected by a formal government backstop but also difficult to capture by traditional 

accounting measures.  A further complication stems from the fact that dealers in securities and 

OTC derivatives--the key providers of leverage outside of the traditional banking system--can 

facilitate a particular economic exposure using a variety of transactional structures including, for 

example, combinations of securities financing, OTC derivatives, and prime brokerage activities. 

To obtain information on the usage and pricing of such leverage, the Federal Reserve 

relies on a number of different indicators, including supervisory and market surveillance data, as 

well as ongoing dialog with a range of market participants to construct a composite picture of the 

extent to which leverage is being deployed, on what terms, and the channels through which 

leverage is being facilitated by dealers.  These indicators include results from the Senior Credit 

Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms (SCOOS), which was launched by the

Federal Reserve last year in June.5  This survey provides qualitative information on credit terms 

and availability of various forms of dealer-intermediated financing--including for securities 

positions--and OTC derivatives. 

The available qualitative and quantitative indicators suggest that dealer-intermediated 

leverage has risen modestly since its post-crisis nadir in 2009.  For example, responses to several 

consecutive SCOOSs point to an easing of price and nonprice credit terms applicable to a range 

of counterparties (including hedge funds, private equity firms, and other private pools of capital, 

shown in figure 5) since early 2010.  In addition, dealers have consistently reported an increase 

in demand for funding across various collateral types.  Furthermore, special questions included 

in the March 2011 SCOOS suggest an increase in the use of leverage by some traditionally 

unlevered investors (such as pension funds and insurance companies) as well as hedge funds 

during the previous six months.     

In spite of this increase, many indicators suggest that the overall use of financial leverage 

remains markedly below levels prevailing before the crisis and has increased only modestly over 

the past year.  For example, as shown in figure 6, activity in the triparty repo market has in fact 

changed little, on balance, over the past year, and haircuts on the most important types of 

collateral have been steady over this period.6  Of note, increases in the utilization of leverage 

have been driven by the financing of relatively liquid asset types (such as equities) through 

comparatively transparent transactions.  Moreover, issuance of structured products that embed 

leverage, which were originated in large volumes prior to the crisis, has not resumed on any 

significant scale.  More broadly, the appetite of most market participants for additional leverage

appears to remain generally muted, with most investors not fully using their existing funding 

capacity.  Therefore, the risk of a rapid and disorderly deleveraging in the event of a swift 

change in market sentiment seems to be limited at this point. 

 Nonetheless, two dynamics with respect to the use of leverage bear watching.  First, 

important classes of generally unlevered investors (for example, pension funds) are reportedly 

finding it difficult in the present low interest rate environment to meet nominal return targets and 

may be reaching for yield by assuming greater interest-rate and credit risk in their portfolios.  

While some investors have also apparently boosted returns by increasing leverage, we see little 

evidence at present that this behavior is occurring on any significant scale.  Second, additional 

funding is reportedly broadly available to traditionally levered investors such as hedge funds.  To 

the extent that investors choose to take advantage of the readily available funding for less liquid 

assets, their use of leverage could rise quickly, increasing the risks of a disorderly deleveraging. 

A Case Study: The Syndicated Leveraged Loan Market 

 I mentioned earlier that strong demand has been pushing prices higher in the 

syndicated loan market and figure 7 shows recent developments:  Inflows into this asset class 

have indeed been robust and prices have been rising quite rapidly.  An important characteristic of 

syndicated loans is that they are floating rate instruments, priced at a fixed spread to Libor (the 

London interbank offered rate).  In an environment where interest rates may be expected to rise, 

this characteristic may partly explain such strong investor interest.  

 To assess the potential financial stability ramifications of these developments, we have 

focused initially on two key questions.  First, to what degree would financial intermediaries be 

exposed to a rapid change in investor sentiment?  Recall that prior to the financial crisis, a 

number of important financial institutions, in their role as lead arrangers of syndicated loans, 


- 9 - 
 

 
 

amassed significant “pipelines” of very large deals, which effectively represented commitments 

to provide financing.  When investor interest waned, banks were left with notable positions in 

“hung” deals, which resulted in substantial mark-to-market losses.  Today, in contrast, banks 

report that they have significant risk mitigants in place to protect their balance sheets.  In 

particular, deals are smaller, financings are reportedly arranged on a “best efforts” basis, and 

banks are said to maintain considerable contractual flexibility post-commitment to adjust the 

pricing and structure of loans, at the expense of borrowers, to market-clearing levels.7  

 A second question is whether leveraged loans are being funded on any significant scale 

using mechanisms, such as repo funding, total return swaps and other OTC derivatives, and 

collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, that were prevalent before the crisis.  During the market 

disruption in 2007-08, the significant leverage deployed through these channels, and the 

operation of the associated mark-to-market triggers, clearly contributed to the disruptions in the 

loan market, and to the losses experienced by banks and other market participants.  When prices 

came under pressure, calls for additional collateral followed, leading in many cases to the sale of 

positions that put further pressure on valuations and started the cycle anew.  But, at present, a 

number of indicators, including SCOOS special questions focused on funding of syndicated 

leveraged loans, provide little evidence of heavy reliance on such mechanisms, suggesting that 

the potential for such a rapid and disorderly delevering is very limited. 

 These comforts aside, demand from unlevered investors, presumably “reaching for 

yield,” has persisted in recent months.  Strong inflows into the asset class have reportedly 

allowed borrowers to bargain for more attractive loan terms, especially given that many funds 

catering to retail and other unlevered investors have little choice but to immediately deploy 

                                                            
7 A “best efforts” syndication entails a commitment by the arranging banks for less than the entire amount of 
financing.  If the loan is undersubscribed, the deal may not close or terms may need to be adjusted to induce greater 
investor demand.

invested funds.  Manifestations of this dynamic include the reemergence of deals that do not 

provide investors with the traditional protection of maintenance covenants--so-called covenant 

lite structures--and of deals financing the distribution of dividends to equity-holders, as well as a 

gradual increase in the levering of the underlying corporate assets by borrowers.  None of these 

developments may, per se, be indicative of unwise or imprudent lending, and in fact each of 

these may respond to a perceived need on the part of some market participants.  However, the 

dynamics of competition are very much on display, including the resultant pressures on fund 

managers to accept and deploy incremental investments, and the pressures on arranging banks to 

maintain their market share.  Indeed, these circumstances were recently highlighted to me by 

market participants.  We will therefore continue to watch conditions in the leveraged loan market 

closely in the coming months, and we will speak out forcefully if we perceive pressures 

continuing to build.   

Tools for Addressing Financial Imbalances 

If substantial evidence of financial imbalances on a broader scale were to develop, 

particularly if accompanied by significant use of leverage, I believe that supervision and 

regulation should constitute our first line of defense.  Indeed, in the wake of the crisis, our 

supervisory process has been significantly modified to take more explicitly into account possible 

financial stability implications and effects on the broader economy, a perspective that is 

frequently described as “macroprudential.”  Our concerns now extend beyond the capacity of 

individual institutions to protect their capital and balance sheets.   

In taking this broader perspective, we continue to rely on many traditional supervisory 

tools.  For example, should they feel the need to more directly address a continued building of 

pressures in the leveraged loan market, supervisors might require institutions to strengthen their 


- 11 - 
 

 
 

underwriting standards while clarifying the degree to which anticipated distribution of loans 

through syndication constitutes risk mitigation.  In addition, supervisory expectations concerning 

risk-management standards applicable to the syndication activity--in particular, the management 

of “pipeline risk” related to the warehousing of loans awaiting distribution--could be made more 

stringent.      

The need to deploy an enhanced set of tools and standards to promote financial stability 

has been widely recognized in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  In the United States, for 

example, more rigorous prudential standards will be applied to systemically important financial 

institutions to ensure that these firms internalize the costs of the risks they pose to the financial 

system and the economy.  Likewise, systemically important institutions will be required to 

develop living wills, or plans to facilitate their resolution in the event of insolvency.  Novel tools 

may be needed, however, to limit--or lean against--the buildup of financial sector imbalances 

that span multiple institutions and markets.  Approaches that have been used in other countries 

when policymakers determine that credit growth and risk-taking have become excessive include, 

for example, restrictions on underwriting practices, such as limits on loan-to-value ratios, loan-

to-income ratios, and debt-to-income ratios.  Of course, the use of such tools must be carefully 

evaluated in the context of the particular imbalance that policymakers are seeking to address, and 

judged both on their potential benefits and potential costs.            

Should monetary policy itself be adjusted to address emerging financial imbalances?  

Given the damage that financial imbalances can cause if not addressed in a timely fashion, I 

would not categorically rule out the use of monetary policy when dangerous imbalances are 

building and prudential steps seem ineffective.  However, calibrating the magnitude of a 

monetary policy response to address financial imbalances--even assuming that these can be 


- 12 - 
 

 
 

identified at an early stage--is difficult at best given the bluntness of the monetary policy tool and 

the uncertain lags with which it operates.  For these reasons, the use of monetary policy to 

address financial imbalances should generally remain a last resort. 

Conclusion 

 The Federal Reserve is fully engaged in monitoring financial markets for potential 

imbalances and developing the tools necessary to carry out that task.  These ongoing efforts 

include attempting to recognize early signs of misaligned valuations in asset markets and 

increases in leverage.  At present, we see few indications of significant imbalances, and the use 

of leverage appears to remain well below pre-crisis levels.  That said, I’ve noted some recent 

developments that warrant close attention, including indications of potentially stretched 

valuations in certain U.S. financial markets and emerging signs that investors are reaching for 

yield.  Should broader concerns emerge, I believe that supervisory and regulatory tools, 

including new macroprudential approaches, rather than monetary policy, should serve as the first 

line of defense.
