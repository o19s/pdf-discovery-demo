Conference on Economic Opportunity and Inequality

The distribution of income and wealth in the United States has been widening 

more or less steadily for several decades, to a greater extent than in most advanced 

countries.1  This trend paused during the Great Recession because of larger wealth losses 

for those at the top of the distribution and because increased safety-net spending helped 

offset some income losses for those below the top.  But widening inequality resumed in 

the recovery, as the stock market rebounded, wage growth and the healing of the labor 

market have been slow, and the increase in home prices has not fully restored the housing 

wealth lost by the large majority of households for which it is their primary asset.   

The extent of and continuing increase in inequality in the United States greatly 

concern me.  The past several decades have seen the most sustained rise in inequality 

since the 19th century after more than 40 years of narrowing inequality following the 

Great Depression.  By some estimates, income and wealth inequality are near their 

highest levels in the past hundred years, much higher than the average during that time 

span and probably higher than for much of American history before then.2  It is no secret 

that the past few decades of widening inequality can be summed up as significant income 

and wealth gains for those at the very top and stagnant living standards for the majority.  I 

think it is appropriate to ask whether this trend is compatible with values rooted in our

nation’s history, among them the high value Americans have traditionally placed on 

equality of opportunity.   

Some degree of inequality in income and wealth, of course, would occur even 

with completely equal opportunity because variations in effort, skill, and luck will 

produce variations in outcomes.  Indeed, some variation in outcomes arguably contributes 

to economic growth because it creates incentives to work hard, get an education, save, 

invest, and undertake risk.  However, to the extent that opportunity itself is enhanced by 

access to economic resources, inequality of outcomes can exacerbate inequality of 

opportunity, thereby perpetuating a trend of increasing inequality.  Such a link is 

suggested by the “Great Gatsby Curve,” the finding that, among advanced economies, 

greater income inequality is associated with diminished intergenerational mobility.3  In 

such circumstances, society faces difficult questions of how best to fairly and justly 

promote equal opportunity.  My purpose today is not to provide answers to these 

contentious questions, but rather to provide a factual basis for further discussion.  I am 

pleased that this conference will focus on equality of economic opportunity and on ways 

to better promote it.  

In my remarks, I will review trends in income and wealth inequality over the past 

several decades, then identify and discuss four sources of economic opportunity in 

America--think of them as “building blocks” for the gains in income and wealth that most 

Americans hope are within reach of those who strive for them.  The first two are widely 

recognized as important sources of opportunity:  resources available for children and

affordable higher education.  The second two may come as more of a surprise:  business 

ownership and inheritances.  Like most sources of wealth, family ownership of 

businesses and inheritances are concentrated among households at the top of the 

distribution.  But both of these are less concentrated and more broadly distributed than 

other forms of wealth, and there is some basis for thinking that they may also play a role 

in providing economic opportunities to a considerable number of families below the top.   

In focusing on these four building blocks, I do not mean to suggest that they 

account for all economic opportunity, but I do believe they are all significant sources of 

opportunity for individuals and their families to improve their economic circumstances.  

Income and Wealth Inequality in the Survey of Consumer Finances 

I will start with the basics about widening inequality, drawing heavily on a trove 

of data generated by the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), 

the latest of which was conducted in 2013 and published last month.4  The SCF is broadly 

consistent with other data that show widening wealth and income inequality over the past 

several decades, but I am employing the SCF because it offers the added advantage of 

specific detail on income, wealth, and debt for each of 6,000 households surveyed.5  This 

detail from family balance sheets provides a glimpse of the relative access to the four 

sources of opportunity I will discuss. 

                                                 
4 Asset questions in the SCF are based on the value at the time of the survey.  Since most interviews were 

completed between April and December 2013, some of the asset values do not reflect price increases 

experienced in late 2013, and none reflect increases in 2014.  Income questions in the SCF refer to the prior 

calendar year, so the 2013 survey reports 2012 income.  See Jesse Bricker, Lisa J. Dettling, Alice 

Henriques, Joanne W. Hsu, Kevin B. Moore, John Sabelhaus, Jeffrey Thompson, and Richard A. Windle 

(2014), “Changes in U.S. Family Finances from 2010 to 2013:  Evidence from the Survey of Consumer 

Finances,” Federal Reserve Bulletin, vol. 100 (September), pp. 1-41, 

www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2014/articles/scf/scf.htm.   
5 “Households” and “families” are used interchangeably in these remarks because the SCF uses both 

interchangeably to describe its respondents.

While the recent trend of widening income and wealth inequality is clear, the 

implications for a particular family partly depend on whether that family’s living 

standards are rising or not as its relative position changes.  There have been some times 

of relative prosperity when income has grown for most households but inequality 

widened because the gains were proportionally larger for those at the top; widening 

inequality might not be as great a concern if living standards improve for most families.  

That was the case for much of the 1990s, when real incomes were rising for most 

households.  At other times, however, inequality has widened because income and wealth 

grew for those at the top and stagnated or fell for others.  And at still other times, 

inequality has widened when incomes were falling for most households, but the declines 

toward the bottom were proportionally larger.  Unfortunately, the past several decades of 

widening inequality has often involved stagnant or falling living standards for many 

families. 

Since the survey began in its current form in 1989, the SCF has shown a rise in 

the concentration of income in the top few percent of households, as shown in figure 1.6 

By definition, of course, the share of all income held by the rest, the vast majority of 

households, has fallen by the same amount.7  This concentration was the result of income 

and living standards rising much more quickly for those at the top.  After adjusting for 

                                                 
6 The share of income that went to the top 5 percent of households--a threshold of $230,000 in gross 

income in 2013--rose from 31 percent of income reported by all respondents in 1989 to 37 percent in 2007.  

The income share for this group fell in the financial crisis, to 34 percent in 2010, then rose in the recovery, 

regaining a 37 percent share in 2013. 
7 The top half of the distribution, except for the top 5 percent, earned 53 percent of all income in 1989 but 

only 51 percent in 2010. In 2013, households in the “next 45 percent” had incomes between $47,000 and 

$230,000.  While income has rebounded for the top 5 percent in the recovery, the share that went to the 

next 45 percent declined further to 49 percent in 2013.  The bottom half of the distribution saw their share 

of income fall from 16 percent in 1989 to 15 percent in 2007, edge up in 2010, and then reach a new low 

for the survey last year at 14 percent.

inflation, the average income of the top 5 percent of households grew by 38 percent from 

1989 to 2013, as we can see in figure 2.  By comparison, the average real income of the 

other 95 percent of households grew less than 10 percent.  Income inequality narrowed 

slightly during the Great Recession, as income fell more for the top than for others, but 

resumed widening in the recovery, and by 2013 it had nearly returned to the pre-recession 

peak.8  

The distribution of wealth is even more unequal than that of income, and the SCF 

shows that wealth inequality has increased more than income inequality since 1989.  As 

shown in figure 3, the wealthiest 5 percent of American households held 54 percent of all 

wealth reported in the 1989 survey.  Their share rose to 61 percent in 2010 and reached 

63 percent in 2013.  By contrast, the rest of those in the top half of the wealth 

distribution--families that in 2013 had a net worth between $81,000 and $1.9 million--

held 43 percent of wealth in 1989 and only 36 percent in 2013. 

The lower half of households by wealth held just 3 percent of wealth in 1989 and 

only 1 percent in 2013.  To put that in perspective, figure 4 shows that the average net 

worth of the lower half of the distribution, representing 62 million households, was 

$11,000 in 2013.9  About one-fourth of these families reported zero wealth or negative 

net worth, and a significant fraction of those said they were “underwater” on their home 

mortgages, owing more than the value of the home.10  This $11,000 average is 50 percent 

                                                 
8 Largely because of losses in income from financial holdings, the share of total income received by the top 

5 percent of households fell 3 percentage points from 2007 to 2010, with the next 45 percent and lower half 

of households each gaining about half of that share.  Some of the nominal income losses for households 

below the top 5 percent were offset by larger-than-normal transfer payments during the recession.  
9 All SCF income and wealth data prior to the 2013 survey are adjusted for inflation by expressing the 

values in 2013 dollars. 
10 In the 2013 SCF, 17 percent of all families reporting zero or negative net worth also reported they were 

underwater on their home mortgages.

lower than the average wealth of the lower half of families in 1989, adjusted for inflation.  

Average real wealth rose gradually for these families for most of those years, then 

dropped sharply after 2007.  Figure 5 shows that average wealth also grew steadily for 

the “next 45” percent of households before the crisis but didn’t fall nearly as much 

afterward.  Those next 45 households saw their wealth, measured in 2013 dollars, grow 

from an average of $323,000 in 1989 to $516,000 in 2007 and then fall to $424,000 in 

2013, a net gain of about one-third over 24 years.  Meanwhile, the average real wealth of 

families in the top 5 percent has nearly doubled, on net--from $3.6 million in 1989 to 

$6.8 million in 2013.  

Housing wealth--the net equity held by households, consisting of the value of 

their homes minus their mortgage debt--is the most important source of wealth for all but 

those at the very top.11  It accounted for three-fifths of wealth in 2013 for the lower half 

of families and two-fifths of wealth for the next 45.  But housing wealth was only one-

fifth of total wealth for the top 5 percent of families.  The share of housing in total net 

worth for all three groups has not changed much since 1989.  

Since housing accounts for a larger share of wealth for those in the bottom half of 

the wealth distribution, their overall wealth is affected more by changes in home prices.  

Furthermore, homeowners in the bottom half have been more highly leveraged on their 

homes, amplifying this difference.  As a result, while the SCF shows that all three groups 

saw proportionally similar increases and subsequent declines in home prices from 1989 to 

2013, the effects on net worth were greater for those in the bottom half of households by 

wealth.  Foreclosures and the dramatic fall in house prices affected many of these

families severely, pushing them well down the wealth distribution.  Figure 6 shows that 

homeowners in the bottom half of households by wealth reported 61 percent less home 

equity in 2013 than in 2007.  The next 45 reported a 29 percent loss of housing wealth, 

and the top 5 lost 20 percent. 

Fortunately, rebounding housing prices in 2013 and 2014 have restored a good 

deal of the loss in housing wealth, with the largest gains for those toward the bottom.  

Based on rising home prices alone and not counting possible changes in mortgage debt or 

other factors, Federal Reserve staff estimate that between 2013 and mid-2014, average 

home equity rose 49 percent for the lowest half of families by wealth that own homes.12  

The estimated gains are somewhat less for those with greater wealth.13  Homeowners in 

the bottom 50, which had an average overall net worth of $25,000 in 2013, would have 

seen their net worth increase to an average of $33,000 due solely to home price gains 

since 2013, a 32 percent increase.  

Another major source of wealth for many families is financial assets, including 

stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and private pensions.14  Figure 7 shows that the wealthiest 

5 percent of households held nearly two-thirds of all such assets in 2013, the next 

45 percent of families held about one-third, and the bottom half of households, just 

2 percent.  This figure may look familiar, since the distribution of financial wealth has 

                                                 
12 The house price data used are from CoreLogic, and data track price changes at the Core Based Statistical 

Area level between the survey month in 2013 and June 2014.  The average increase in home prices over 

this period was 8 percent.  No adjustments are made to account for possible changes in mortgage leverage. 
13 Home price gains in 2013 and 2014 are estimated to have raised the home equity of home-owning 

households in the next 45 percent of households in the wealth distribution by 12 percent, and by 9 percent 

for home-owning households in the top 5 percent of the wealth distribution. 
14 The SCF defines financial assets as liquid assets, certificates of deposit, directly held pooled investment 

funds, stocks, bonds, quasi-liquid assets (including retirement accounts), savings bonds, whole life 

insurance, other managed assets, and other financial assets.

concentrated at the top since 1989 at rates similar to those for overall wealth, which we 

saw in figure 3.15 

Those are the basics on wealth and income inequality from the SCF.  Other 

research tells us that inequality tends to persist from one generation to the next.  For 

example, one study that divides households by income found that 4 in 10 children raised 

in families in the lowest-income fifth of households remain in that quintile as adults.16  

Fewer than 1 in 10 children of families at the bottom later reach the top quintile.  The 

story is flipped for children raised in the highest-income households:  When they grow 

up, 4 in 10 stay at the top and fewer than 1 in 10 fall to the bottom.   

Research also indicates that economic mobility in the United States has not 

changed much in the last several decades; that mobility is lower in the United States than 

in most other advanced countries; and, as I noted earlier, that economic mobility and 

income inequality among advanced countries are negatively correlated.17  

Four Building Blocks of Opportunity 

An important factor influencing intergenerational mobility and trends in 

inequality over time is economic opportunity.  While we can measure overall mobility 

                                                 
15 In 1989, the top 5 percent of households held 54 percent of financial assets, the next 45 percent (that is, 

home-owning households in the 50th through 95th percentiles of the wealth distribution) held 42 percent, 

and the bottom half held 4 percent.

and inequality, summarizing opportunity is harder, which is why I intend to focus on 

some important sources of opportunity--the four building blocks I mentioned earlier.   

Two of those are so significant that you might call them “cornerstones” of 

opportunity, and you will not be surprised to hear that both are largely related to 

education.  The first of these cornerstones I would describe more fully as “resources 

available to children in their most formative years.”  The second is higher education that 

students and their families can afford. 

Two additional sources of opportunity are evident in the SCF.  They affect fewer 

families than the two cornerstones I have just identified, but enough families and to a 

sufficient extent that I believe they are also important sources of economic opportunity. 

The third building block of opportunity, as shown by the SCF, is ownership of a 

private business.18  This usually means ownership and sometimes direct management of a 

family business.  The fourth source of opportunity is inherited wealth.  As one would 

expect, inheritances are concentrated among the wealthiest families, but the SCF 

indicates they may also play an important role in the opportunities available to others. 

Resources Available for Children  

For households with children, family resources can pay for things that research 

shows enhance future earnings and other economic outcomes--homes in safer 

neighborhoods with good schools, for example, better nutrition and health care, early 

childhood education, intervention for learning disabilities, travel and other potentially 

                                                 
18 Business assets in the SCF include both actively and “non-actively” managed businesses but do not 

include ownership of publicly traded stock.

enriching experiences.19  Affluent families have significant resources for things that give 

children economic advantages as adults, and the SCF data I have cited indicate that many 

other households have very little to spare for this purpose.  These disparities extend to 

other household characteristics associated with better economic outcomes for offspring, 

such as homeownership rates, educational attainment of parents, and a stable family 

structure.20   

According to the SCF, the gap in wealth between families with children at the 

bottom and the top of the distribution has been growing steadily over the past 24 years, 

but that pace has accelerated recently.  Figure 8 shows that the median wealth for families 

with children in the lower half of the wealth distribution fell from $13,000 in 2007 to 

$8,000 in 2013, after adjusting for inflation, a loss of 40 percent.21  These wealth levels 

look small alongside the much higher wealth of the next 45 percent of households with 

children.  But these families also saw their median wealth fall dramatically--by one-third 

                                                 
19 See, for example, Janet Currie and Douglas Almond (2011), “Human Capital Development before Age 

Five,” ch. 15 in David Card and Orley Ashenfelter, eds., Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4 (Holland:  

Elsevier), pp. 1315-1486. 
20 Homeownership by parents is strongly associated with economic success for children; see Thomas P. 

Boehm and Alan M. Schlottmann (1999), “Does Home Ownership by Parents Have an Economic Impact 

on Their Children?” Journal of Housing Economics, vol. 8 (September), pp. 217-32, 

www.researchgate.net/publication/223016312_Does_Home_Ownership_by_Parents_Have_an_Economic_

Impact_on_Their_Children.  Ninety-seven percent of top-earning families with children own a home, 

compared with fewer than half of the bottom 50 percent of families with children; educational attainment of 

parents is strongly predictive of outcomes for children that determine earnings.  See Ayana Douglas-Hall 

and Michelle Chau (2007), “Parents’ Low Education Leads to Low Income, Despite Full-Time 

Employment” (New York:  National Center for Children in Poverty, Columbia University, November), 

www.nccp.org/publications/pub_786.html.  A considerable body of literature establishes the correlation 

between educational attainment of parents and their children.  Other research has identified that this 

relationship is causal; see, for example, Philip Oreopoulos, Marianne E. Page, and Ann Huff Stevens 

(2006), “The Intergenerational Effects of Compulsory Schooling,” Journal of Labor Economics, vol. 24 

(October), pp. 729-60.  Eighty-six percent of top-earning households in the SCF with children are headed 

by a college graduate, compared with 12 percent in the bottom half of households with children; children 

raised by a single parent earn less as adults.  See Mary Ann Powell and Toby L. Parcel (1997), “Effects of 

Family Structure on the Earnings Attainment Process:  Differences by Gender,” Journal of Marriage and 

Family, vol. 59 (May), pp. 419-33.  Only 4 percent of top-earning households with children are headed by 

unmarried parents, compared with 47 percent for the lower half of households with children. 
21 Distributional statistics for families with children are based on a sorting of only families with children.

in real terms--from $344,000 in 2007 to $229,000 in 2013.  The top 5 percent of families 

with children saw their median wealth fall only 9 percent, from $3.5 million in 2007 to 

$3.2 million in 2013, after inflation. 

For families below the top, public funding plays an important role in providing 

resources to children that influence future levels of income and wealth.  Such funding has 

the potential to help equalize these resources and the opportunities they confer. 

Social safety-net spending is an important form of public funding that helps offset 

disparities in family resources for children.  Spending for income security programs since 

1989 and until recently was fairly stable, ranging between 1.2 and 1.7 percent of gross 

domestic product (GDP), with higher levels in this range related to recessions.  However, 

such spending rose to 2.4 percent of GDP in 2009 and 3 percent in 2010.22  Researchers 

estimate that the increase in the poverty rate because of the recession would have been 

much larger without the effects of income security programs.23  

Public funding of education is another way that governments can help offset the 

advantages some households have in resources available for children.  One of the most 

consequential examples is early childhood education.  Research shows that children from 

lower-income households who get good-quality pre-Kindergarten education are more 

likely to graduate from high school and attend college as well as hold a job and have 

higher earnings, and they are less likely to be incarcerated or receive public assistance.24

Figure 9 shows that access to quality early childhood education has improved since the 

1990s, but it remains limited--41 percent of children were enrolled in state or federally 

supported programs in 2013.  Gains in enrollment have stalled since 2010, as has growth 

in funding, in both cases because of budget cuts related to the Great Recession.  These 

cuts have reduced per-pupil spending in state-funded programs by 12 percent after 

inflation, and access to such programs, most of which are limited to lower-income 

families, varies considerably from state to state and within states, since local funding is 

often important.25  In 2010, the United States ranked 28th out of 38 advanced countries in 

the share of four-year-olds enrolled in public or private early childhood education.26 

Similarly, the quality and the funding levels of public education at the primary 

and secondary levels vary widely, and this unevenness limits public education’s 

equalizing effect.  The United States is one of the few advanced economies in which 

public education spending is often lower for students in lower-income households than 

for students in higher-income households.27  Some countries strive for more or less equal 

funding, and others actually require higher funding in schools serving students from

lower-income families, expressly for the purpose of reducing inequality in resources for 

children.   

A major reason the United States is different is that we are one of the few 

advanced nations that funds primary and secondary public education mainly through 

subnational taxation.  Half of U.S. public school funding comes from local property 

taxes, a much higher share than in other advanced countries, and thus the inequalities in 

housing wealth and income I have described enhance the ability of more-affluent school 

districts to spend more on public schools.  Some states have acted to equalize spending to 

some extent in recent years, but there is still significant variation among and within 

states.  Even after adjusting for regional differences in costs and student needs, there is 

wide variation in public school funding in the United States.28 

Spending is not the only determinant of outcomes in public education.  Research 

shows that higher-quality teachers raise the educational attainment and the future 

earnings of students.29  Better-quality teachers can help equalize some of the 

disadvantages in opportunity faced by students from lower-income households, but here, 

too, there are forces that work against raising teacher quality for these students.  Research 

shows that, for a variety of reasons, including inequality in teacher pay, the best teachers 

tend to migrate to and concentrate in schools in higher-income areas.30  Even within

districts and in individual schools, where teacher pay is often uniform based on 

experience, factors beyond pay tend to lead more experienced and better-performing 

teachers to migrate to schools and to classrooms with more-advantaged students.31 

Higher Education that Families Can Afford 

For many individuals and families, higher education is the other cornerstone of 

economic opportunity.  The premium in lifetime earnings because of higher education 

has increased over the past few decades, reflecting greater demand for college-educated 

workers.  By one measure, the median annual earnings of full-time workers with a four-

year bachelor’s degree are 79 percent higher than the median for those with only a high 

school diploma.32  The wage premium for a graduate degree is significantly higher than 

the premium for a college degree.  Despite escalating costs for college, the net returns for 

a degree are high enough that college still offers a considerable economic opportunity to 

most people.33

31 Better and more-experienced teachers tend to move to better-resourced schools, including those with 

more active outside funding, or those with more-advantaged students, such as magnet schools.  Even within 

schools, more experienced and higher performing teachers are more likely to teach Advanced Placement 

classes which tend to serve more advantaged students.  The result is that lower income and lower achieving 

students are more likely to be taught by less experienced and lower performing teachers.  See Charles 

Clotfelter, Helen Ladd, Jacob Vigdor, and Justin Wheeler (2007), “High Poverty Schools and the 

Distribution of Teachers and Principals,” North Carolina Law Review, vol. 85 (2), pp. 1345-79; Charles

Along with other data, the SCF shows that most students and their families are 

having a harder time affording college.  College costs have risen much faster than income 

for the large majority of households since 2001 and have become especially burdensome 

for households in the bottom half of the earnings distribution. 

Rising college costs, the greater numbers of students pursuing higher education, 

and the recent trends in income and wealth have led to a dramatic increase in student loan 

debt.  Outstanding student loan debt quadrupled from $260 billion in 2004 to $1.1 trillion 

this year.  Sorting families by wealth, the SCF shows that the relative burden of education 

debt has long been higher for families with lower net worth, and that this disparity has 

grown much wider in the past couple decades.  Figure 10 shows that from 1995 to 2013, 

outstanding education debt grew from 26 percent of average yearly income for the lower 

half of households to 58 percent of income.34  The education debt burden was lower and 

grew a little less sharply for the next 45 percent of families and was much lower and 

grew not at all for the top 5 percent.35 

Higher education has been and remains a potent source of economic opportunity 

in America, but I fear the large and growing burden of paying for it may make it harder 

for many young people to take advantage of the opportunity higher education offers.  

Opportunities to Build Wealth through Business Ownership 

For many people, the opportunity to build a business has long been an important 

part of the American dream.  In addition to housing and financial assets, the SCF shows 

                                                 
15 percent.  See Jaison R. Abel and Richard Deitz (2014), “Do the Benefits of College Still Outweigh the 

Costs?” Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Current Issues in Economics and Finance, vol. 20 (3),

34 Education debt in the SCF reflects the total amount of debt outstanding at the time of the survey.

that ownership of private businesses is a significant source of wealth and can be a vital 

source of opportunity for many households to improve their economic circumstances and 

position in the wealth distribution. 

While business wealth is highly concentrated at the top of the distribution, it also 

represents a significant component of wealth for some other households. 36  Figure 11 

shows that slightly more than half of the top 5 percent of households have a share in a 

private business.  The average value of these holdings is nearly $4 million.  Only 

14 percent of families in the next 45 have ownership in a private business, but for those 

that do, this type of wealth constitutes a substantial portion of their assets--the average 

amount of this business equity is nearly $200,000, representing more than one-third of 

their net worth.  Only 3 percent of the bottom half of households hold equity in a private 

business, but it is a big share of wealth for those few.37  The average amount of this 

wealth is close to $20,000, 60 percent of the average net worth for these households.38  

Owning a business is risky, and most new businesses close within a few years. 

But research shows that business ownership is associated with higher levels of economic 

mobility.39  However, it appears that it has become harder to start and build businesses.  

The pace of new business creation has gradually declined over the past couple of 

                                                 
36 The SCF does not ask households whether they started businesses that closed, so reported business 

ownership and wealth is largely related only to those businesses that succeed. 
37 Distributional statistics for business ownership and assets exclude outliers with large negative net worth. 
38 Business wealth took a big hit due to the recession and has only partly recovered for most families.  For 

the bottom half of the distribution, the $20,000 average in business wealth in 2013 was down from $29,000, 

after adjusting for inflation, in 2007. The nearly $200,000 held by the next 45 percent with businesses was 

down from $228,000 in 2007.  The $4 million in business wealth of the top 5 percent in 2013 was down, in 

real terms, from $4.4 million in 2007.

Owners,” Industrial Relations, vol. 43 (July), pp. 634-59; Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Harvey S. Rosen, and 

Robert Weathers (2000), “Horatio Alger Meets the Mobility Tables,” Small Business Economics, vol. 14,

decades, and the number of new firms declined sharply from 2006 through 2009.40  The 

latest SCF shows that the percentage of the next 45 that own a business has fallen to a 25-

year low, and equity in those businesses, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest point since 

the mid-1990s.  One reason to be concerned about the apparent decline in new business 

formation is that it may serve to depress the pace of productivity, real wage growth, and 

employment.41  Another reason is that a slowdown in business formation may threaten 

what I believe likely has been a significant source of economic opportunity for many 

families below the very top in income and wealth.  

Inheritances 

Along with other economic advantages, it is likely that large inheritances play a 

role in the fairly limited intergenerational mobility that I described earlier.42  But 

inheritances are also common among households below the top of the wealth distribution 

and sizable enough that I believe they may well play a role in helping these families 

economically.  

Figure 12 shows that half of the top 5 percent of households by wealth reported 

receiving an inheritance at some time, but a considerable number of others did as well--

almost 30 percent of the next 45 percent and 12 percent of the bottom 50.  Inheritances 

are concentrated at the top of the wealth distribution but less so than total wealth.  Just 

over half of the total value of inheritances went to the top 5 percent and 40 percent went 

to households in the next 45.  Seven percent of inheritances were shared among 

households in the bottom 50 percent, a group that together held only 1 percent of all 

wealth in 2013.43   

The average inheritance reported by those in the top 5 percent who had received 

them was $1.1 million.  That amount dwarfs the $183,000 average among the next 

45 percent and the $68,000 reported among the bottom half of households.  But compared 

with the typical wealth of these households, the additive effect of bequests of this size is 

significant for the millions of households below the top 5 that receive them.  

The average age for receiving an inheritance is 40, when many parents are trying 

to save for and secure the opportunities of higher education for their children, move up to 

a larger home or one in a better neighborhood, launch a business, switch careers, or 

perhaps relocate to seek more opportunity. Considering the overall picture of limited 

resources for most families that I have described today, I think the effects of inheritances 

for the sizable minority below the top that receive one are likely a significant source of 

economic opportunity.  

Conclusion 

 In closing, let me say that, with these examples, I have only just touched the 

surface of the important topic of economic opportunity, and I look forward to learning 

                                                 
43 Reported inheritances can have been received at any point in the respondent’s life.  As with other forms 

of wealth cited in these remarks, inheritances have been adjusted for inflation and are expressed in 2013 

dollars.

more from the work presented at this conference.  As I noted at the outset, research about 

the causes and implications of inequality is ongoing, and I hope that this conference helps 

spur further study of economic opportunity and its effects on economic mobility.  Using 

the SCF and other sources, I have tried to offer some observations about how access to 

four specific sources of opportunity may vary across households, but I cannot offer any 

conclusions about how much these factors influence income and wealth inequality.  I do 

believe that these are important questions, and I hope that further research will help 

answer them.
