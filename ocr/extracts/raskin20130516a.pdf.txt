Thank you.  I am very pleased to be here among an audience of professional 

economists, which is certainly preferable to appearing before an audience of 

unprofessional economists.  I like your kind!  Your talents are needed now more than 

ever as we try to put the tools of the economic profession to work for the common good.   

It’s easy to be an economist who looks back on crises and crashes and tries to explain 

why they happened, but much harder to be an economist whose efforts manage to help 

stop them from happening in the first place.  Economic policymaking, at its best, reflects 

a continuous struggle to make sure that data and explanations of such data are consistent 

with real experience.  If we’re to engage in this struggle honestly, it’s no easy task.  It 

involves understanding not just the reliability and signal in various data, but also 

questioning whether the data accords with our understanding of actual experience.  So, to 

get this right requires many different perspectives, not just on the data but on the 

underlying realities the data are trying to capture.  Government economists understand 

that non-economists bring something valuable to the table in policymaking--a grounded 

perspective in what is happening in the economy.  

With that said, what is really happening now in the American economy?  What do 

the economic data we see at the Federal Reserve currently show, and how do we think 

these data line up with the economic realities of most American households and 

businesses?  In my remarks today I will offer my assessment of recent economic 

developments and the economic outlook, and I will discuss the actions that the Federal 

Reserve has been taking, in light of its view of developments and the outlook, to support 

the economic recovery.  Before I begin, I should note that the views that I will be 


 - 2 -

presenting are my own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) or the Board of Governors.   

Recent Economic and Financial Developments 

For the past three and a half years the U.S. economy has been in a recovery--

albeit a very weak one--from a severe financial crisis and the deepest recession of the 

post-World War II period.  The unemployment rate, which reached a high of 10 percent 

in the fall of 2009, has since come down 2-1/2 percentage points, to 7.5 percent in April.   

The increase in economic activity and the decline in the unemployment rate are, 

of course, welcome, but we still have a long way to go to reach what feels like a healthy 

economy.  In fact, the pace of recovery has been slower than most had expected.  The gap 

between actual output and the economy’s potential remains quite large, according to 

estimates from the Congressional Budget Office, and the unemployment rate today 

remains well above levels seen prior to the recession, and well above the level that the 

Committee thinks can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved.  In addition, 

the number of long-term unemployed--people who have been unemployed for 27 weeks 

or more--remains historically high.   

My interpretation of the economic data that we have received over the past few 

quarters is that the recovery has continued to gain traction.  The Bureau of Economic 

Analysis reported last month that real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at an annual 

rate of 2-1/2 percent in the first quarter of this year after barely expanding at all in the 

fourth quarter of 2012.  The step-up in growth in the first quarter partly reflected a 

rebound from last year’s drought and Hurricane Sandy.  Smoothing through these factors, 


 - 3 -

real GDP was about 1-3/4 percent above its year-earlier level in the first quarter, a modest 

gain that is about in line with the pace of growth during much of the recovery.   

The strength of the recovery among the components of GDP has been mixed 

recently.  In terms of the housing sector, there is no question that many communities and 

neighborhoods were devastated by the effects of the financial crisis.  Recently, we see 

that overall demand has been strengthening, with both home sales and prices rising 

markedly in many areas.  Both new and existing home sales have moved up, on net, since 

late 2011, and housing starts averaged an annual rate of nearly 1 million units in the first 

quarter of this year, up considerably from the extremely low levels that prevailed through 

2011.  Inventories of new homes for sale have become quite lean in most markets over 

the past year, a notable change from earlier in the recovery.  The increase in activity in 

the housing sector has been driven by historically low mortgage rates, growing optimism 

about future house prices, continued gains in the job market, and sizable purchases of 

homes by investors.   

Elsewhere in the household sector, consumer spending--about two-thirds of 

overall final demand--has continued growing at a moderate pace.  On the whole, families 

have benefited from the modest improvement in the labor market, and rising stock prices 

and rebounding home values have helped some households recoup part of the wealth they 

lost during the recession.   

However, overall wage growth has been anemic, and many households have not 

seen their circumstances improve materially.  As I described in a speech last month, 

globalization and technological change have continued to shift the occupations and 

industrial distribution of new jobs available.  These currents of globalization and 


 - 4 -

technological change continue on their path, making it more likely that workers who were 

laid off during the recession would be unable to find reemployment that is of comparable 

quality to their previous jobs.1  About two-thirds of all job losses in the recession were in 

middle-wage occupations--such as manufacturing, skilled construction, and office 

administration jobs--but these occupations have accounted for less than one-fourth of the 

job growth during the recovery.2  By contrast, lower-wage occupations, such as retail 

sales, food service, and other lower-paying service jobs, accounted for only one-fifth of 

job losses during the recession but more than one-half of total job gains during the 

recovery.  As a result of these trends in job creation, which could well have been 

exacerbated by the severe nature of the crisis, the earnings potential for many households 

likely remains below what they had anticipated in the years before the recession.  

Moreover, as you all know, the temporary payroll tax cut has now expired, and many 

households have seen their disposable incomes reduced for this reason as well.     

Spending in the business sector recently has increased only modestly, perhaps due 

in part to the effect of these recent tax changes on consumers.  Real spending on 

equipment and software rose about 4 percent over the past 12 months, according to the 

most recent GDP report, a modest gain for this category of spending.  Indicators for 

capital investment in the months ahead, including new orders for durable capital goods 

and survey measures of business sentiment, suggest that growth in business spending on 

new equipment and software is likely to remain modest in the coming quarters.

Turning to the government sector, the legislated reduction in spending by the 

federal government is exerting a clear and continuing drag on economic activity.  Even 

prior to the bulk of the spending cuts associated with sequestration, real purchases by the 

federal government were reported to have dropped at an annual rate of more than 8 

percent in the first quarter of this year, following an even larger drop in the fourth quarter 

of last year.  These cuts in federal spending are likely to be an important influence on the 

near-term prospects for economic growth, and I will say more about this issue in a 

moment.   

In contrast to the federal government, the budget outlook for state and local 

government continues to improve, and the drag on economic activity from this sector’s 

cutbacks in spending has diminished considerably.     

Reflecting some of these mixed influences, as I already noted, real GDP has been 

rising at a very modest rate, and the labor market has shown similarly modest gains over 

the past year, with the unemployment rate coming down about 1/2 percentage point.  To 

more fully understand the experience of the 11.7 million Americans who can’t find work, 

we look to broader measures of labor underutilization, which take into account job 

seekers who have stopped looking for work because they have become discouraged, and 

people working part time but who would prefer to work full time.  Recently, these 

numbers seem to be coming down.  The gains in payroll employment over this period 

have been about in line with the decline in the unemployment rate, although, as is typical, 

the pace of job gains has been somewhat erratic in recent months.  Since the beginning of 

the year, the increases in payroll employment have averaged 196,000 per month, a little 

above the 183,000 average monthly gains observed during 2012.

Other indicators from the labor market have also shown some improvement 

recently.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance have declined since last summer, 

and the number of job openings appears to be increasing.  I hope these indicators mean 

we are turning the corner on some of the painful costs associated with being unemployed 

or underemployed in America.     

Turning to inflation, recent data show that price pressures have remained 

subdued.  Both total and core inflation were only about 1 percent over the 12 months 

ending in March, below the FOMC’s long-run objective of 2 percent.  Inflation is being 

restrained by the continued slack in labor and product markets, while stable inflation 

expectations have offset disinflationary pressures to some extent.  Moreover, the increase 

in gasoline prices that we saw earlier in the year appears to have fully reversed, and the 

path of oil futures prices is downward-sloping, suggesting that energy prices are likely to 

hold down headline inflation rates in the years ahead.   

The Economic Outlook 

Let me now turn to the outlook.  As my Federal Reserve colleagues and I have 

noted in the past, the pace of the economic recovery has been restrained by lingering 

effects of the financial crisis.  Assessing the current strength of the headwinds related to 

these lingering effects is an important determinant of the economic outlook for the 

coming years.   

Unfortunately, current federal fiscal policy is one headwind to the recovery that 

has intensified this year.  In fact, federal fiscal policy has been tightening since 2011, 

after having been quite expansionary during the recession and early in the recovery.  


 - 7 -

More recently, actions by the Administration and the Congress to reduce the budget 

deficit have led to further tightening of federal fiscal policy.   

As I already mentioned, both the tax legislation signed into law in January and the 

sharp spending cuts associated with sequestration will likely significantly hinder GDP 

growth this year.  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that these 

changes in fiscal policy would reduce GDP growth by 1-1/2 percentage points this year 

relative to what we otherwise would have achieved.3  Looking further ahead, fiscal policy 

seems likely to remain restrictive at the federal level.     

The headwinds from the housing sector have eased, and housing market activity is 

likely to continue to contribute to GDP growth over the next few years.  These headwinds 

had been substantial, as the aftermath of the financial crisis and housing bubble left many 

homeowners underwater on their mortgages, a large overhang of vacant homes, and 

mortgage credit very hard to obtain for anyone without an excellent credit record and a 

sizable down payment.  The rise in house prices over the past year or so has lifted 

household net worth and pushed some homeowners above water on their mortgages.  

These developments may help to ease credit for many households as well, although 

mortgage credit remains very tight.     

In a speech last month, I described how the net decline in housing wealth since 

the recession has had particularly acute effects on the balance sheets of lower- and 

middle-income households, which tend to hold a relatively high share of their total wealth 

in their homes.4  Households at the bottom of the income distribution have also had a

harder time than others finding jobs during the recovery and their wages have continued 

to stagnate.  In my view, the large and increasing amount of inequality in income and 

wealth, which has been an ongoing development for decades, may have exacerbated the 

crisis and I think more research is required to determine whether it may also pose a 

significant headwind to the recovery from the crisis for years to come.  So, while I am 

hopeful that pressures will ease further as home prices continue to rebound, I also believe 

that some of the restraints on the recovery may be quite long-lasting.   

The headwind from the financial sector also has diminished somewhat over the 

past year and should present less of a restraint on economic growth than has been the case 

in the recent past.  U.S. equity prices are up more than 10 percent so far this year 

following last year’s 13 percent increase.  Risk spreads embedded in the interest rates 

paid by many American businesses, although still above their pre-crisis levels, have also 

moved down substantially over the past year to levels that are moderate, given the state of 

the broader economy.   

The situation in Europe, although still uncertain, appears to have improved since 

last summer--aided importantly by the policies of the European Central Bank (ECB)--and 

these developments have led to an improvement in financial conditions globally.  Policy 

actions and promises, including the ECB’s program to purchase the sovereign debt of 

vulnerable euro-area countries and discussions about creating a banking union, appear to 

have helped market participants negotiate past some recent hurdles, including the 

challenges in forming a governing coalition in Italy and the severe banking difficulties in 

Cyprus.  If policymakers in Europe can follow through on their commitments to financial 

integration and structural reforms, among other things, financial stress in Europe should 


 - 9 -

continue to lessen, and European economies should gradually recover from their current 

slump.  If the economy in Europe were to begin to grow again, it could support global 

economic growth more broadly.   

The financial condition of the U.S. banking sector has also continued to improve 

from the perspective of regulatory capital.  While much work remains for regulators and 

banks implementing pending capital requirements, most large, medium-sized, and 

community banks are in stronger capital positions today than they were prior to the 

financial crisis.  

Although not all, some consumers at least, are seeing the benefits of 

improvements in financial markets.  In combination with low interest rates, the easing of 

financial stress has allowed some homeowners to refinance their mortgages to lower their 

monthly payments, and some types of loans, such as those for purchasing a new or used 

car, have become available to more people.  That said, we clearly still have a long way to 

go in assuring that Americans have access to affordable credit.  As I noted, an especially 

large number of people are unable to obtain mortgage credit, and credit card borrowing is 

also tight.   

Taken together, the incoming data and my own analysis of recent developments in 

fiscal policy suggest that the recovery will continue at a moderate pace, and the 

unemployment rate will fall gradually.  According to the Summary of Economic 

Projections that was released by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank 

presidents after the March FOMC meeting, my colleagues and I expected real GDP 

growth to step up moderately this year, rising roughly 2-1/2 percent after having risen 

1-3/4 percent in 2012.  In the projection, participants also expected the unemployment 


 - 10 -

rate to be in the range of 7.3 to 7.5 percent by the end of the year.  Looking a bit further 

ahead, FOMC participants largely expected the unemployment rate to continue receding, 

but it was expected to remain above its long-run sustainable level for several years.  

Meanwhile, inflation was expected to remain close to or a little below the Committee’s 

objective of 2 percent, consistent with ongoing slack in the labor and product markets and 

well-anchored inflation expectations.   

Monetary Policy Developments 

In light of this outlook and the risks around the outlook, it has been appropriate 

for the Federal Reserve to continue to pursue a highly accommodative monetary policy.  

As you all know, during the financial crisis and at the onset of the recession, the Federal 

Reserve took strong easing measures, cutting the target for the federal funds rate--the 

traditional tool of monetary policy--to nearly zero by the end of 2008.  During the 

recovery, we have provided additional accommodation through two nontraditional policy 

tools aimed at putting downward pressure on longer-term interest rates even with short-

term rates stuck at zero:  (1) purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage backed 

securities and (2) communication about the future path of the federal funds rate.   

Our most recent policy actions have sought to strengthen the recovery in the face 

of only slow improvements in labor market conditions and subdued inflationary 

pressures.  After last September’s policy meeting, the FOMC announced that the Federal 

Reserve would continue asset purchases until the outlook for the labor market has 

improved substantially in the context of price stability.     

Then, at the meeting in December, the FOMC voted to continue purchasing 

longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion each month and agency 


 - 11 -

mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion each month, and we have maintained 

that pace of asset purchases so far this year.  In considering changes to the pace of asset 

purchases in the future, we take into account judgments about both the efficacy and 

potential costs of these purchases, including potential risks to inflation and financial 

stability, as well as the extent of progress toward our economic objectives.   

At its December meeting, the FOMC also recast its forward guidance to clarify 

how the target for the federal funds rate is expected to depend on future economic 

developments.  Specifically, we said that we anticipate that an exceptionally low funds 

rate is likely to be warranted at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 

6-1/2 percent, inflation over the period between one and two years ahead is projected to 

be no more than 1/2 percentage point above 2 percent, and longer-term inflation 

expectations remain well anchored.  These thresholds are intended to make monetary 

policy more transparent and predictable to the public by making more explicit our 

intention to maintain policy accommodation as long as needed to promote a stronger 

recovery in the context of price stability.   

Although it is still too early to assess the full effects of the most recent policy 

actions, available research suggests that our previous asset purchases have eased financial 

conditions and provided meaningful support to the economic recovery.5   

Given its statutory mandate, the FOMC’s policy actions and communications 

have naturally sought to lower interest rates as a means of strengthening aggregate 

demand, promoting the pace of recovery in the labor market, and keeping inflation from

falling further below the rate preferred by the Committee over the longer run.  We will 

continue to calibrate monetary policy--including both the ongoing pace of asset purchases 

and communications about the likely path of the federal funds rate--in light of our 

interpretations of the latest data and the implications of those interpretations for the 

outlook for economic activity, labor market conditions, and inflation.   

Conclusion 

In summary, the U.S. economy has continued to recover from the effects of the 

financial crisis and deep recession, though at a pace that has been disappointingly slow.  

The recovery does appear to have picked up steam in some sectors, most notably in 

housing, likely reflecting the easing of some of the headwinds that had been holding back 

the pace of the recovery in earlier years.  However, federal fiscal policy remains an 

important source of restraint.   

In light of these factors, most members of the FOMC project a modest 

improvement in the pace of the recovery this year and next, and, accordingly, a modest 

decline in the unemployment rate.  The Federal Reserve will continue to conduct 

monetary policy so as to promote a stronger economic recovery in the context of price 

stability.
