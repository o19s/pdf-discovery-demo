It is a pleasure to be here with you at the American Bar Association banking law 

committee annual meeting.1  Thank you to Meg Tahyar, my longtime friend and colleague, for 

inviting me to speak today.  These are still the early days of my tenure at the Federal 

Reserve--last weekend marked my first three months as the first Vice Chairman for 

Supervision.  In those three months, people have had a lot of questions for me, but the most 

frequently asked question has been:  What’s next?  Today I hope to give you some insights into 

how I am approaching the work of evaluating and improving the post-crisis regulatory regime 

and to outline some specific areas that are emerging as areas of focus early in my tenure.  Some 

of those areas are closer to being ready for action, while others are topics that I believe are 

important and would benefit from more attention and discussion.  My hope is that you will come 

away from our time together with a better sense of my preliminary thinking for charting a course 

forward on financial regulation.  

Efficiency, Transparency, and Simplicity of Regulation 

Before I delve into specifics, let me say a few words about the principles that are guiding 

my approach to evaluating changes to the current regime.  The body of post-crisis financial 

regulation is broad in scope, complicated in detail, and extraordinarily ambitious in its 

objectives.  Core aspects of that project have resulted in critical gains to our financial system: 

higher and better quality capital, an innovative stress testing regime, new liquidity regulation, 

and improvements in the resolvability of large firms.  We undoubtedly have a stronger and more 

resilient financial system due in significant part to the gains from those core reforms.  These 

achievements are consistent with the responsibility of the Federal Reserve to be a steward of a 

                                                            
1 The views I express here are my own and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System.

safe financial system, and with the goal of maintaining the ability of banks to lend through the 

business cycle.  

 That said, the Federal Reserve and our colleagues at other agencies have now spent the 

better part of the past decade building out and standing up the post-crisis regulatory regime.  At 

this point, we have completed the bulk of the work of post-crisis regulation, with an important 

exception being the U.S. implementation of the recently concluded Basel III “end game” 

agreement on bank capital standards at the Basel Committee.  As such, now is an eminently 

natural and expected time to step back and assess those efforts.  It is our responsibility to ensure 

that they are working as intended and--given the breadth and complexity of this new body of 

regulation--it is inevitable that we will be able to improve them, especially with the benefit of 

experience and hindsight. 

In undertaking this review and assessment, in addition to ensuring that we are satisfied 

with the effectiveness of these regulations, I believe that we have an opportunity to improve the 

efficiency, transparency, and simplicity of regulation.  By efficiency I mean the degree to which 

the net cost of regulation--whether in reduced economic growth or in increased frictions in the 

financial system--is outweighed by the benefits of the regulation.  In other words, if we have a 

choice between two methods of equal effectiveness in achieving a goal, we should strive to 

choose the one that is less burdensome for both the system and regulators.   

Efficiency of regulation can be improved through a variety of means.  For example, it can 

mean achieving a given regulation’s objective using fewer tools.  It can mean addressing 

unintended adverse consequences to the industry and the broader public from a regulation or 

eliminating perverse incentives created by a regulation.  It can mean calibrating a given 

regulation more precisely to the risks in need of mitigation.  It can also mean simpler

examination procedures for bank supervisors, or less intrusive examinations for well managed 

firms.  In our approach to assessing post-crisis regulation, we should consider all of these ways 

of improving efficiency.  

Transparency is an objective that ought to particularly resonate with this audience.  As 

lawyers, we were all trained to view transparency as a necessary precondition to the core 

democratic ideal of government accountability--the governed have a right to know the rules 

imposed on them by the government.  In addition, as any good lawyer also recognizes, there are 

valuable, practical benefits to transparency around rulemaking; even good ideas can improve as a 

result of exposure to a variety of perspectives.  

Finally, simplicity of regulation is a principle that promotes public understanding of 

regulation, promotes meaningful compliance by the industry with regulation, and reduces 

unexpected negative synergies among regulations.  Confusion that results from overly complex 

regulation does not advance the goal of a safe system.   

Common Ground Areas of Improvement    

When I arrived at the Federal Reserve, the early stages of reflection on how to improve 

the cost-benefit balance of post-crisis regulation had already begun, mainly in a few narrow areas 

of focus.  These were areas of low-hanging fruit in which relatively broad consensus was reached 

that efficiency enhancements were available with no material cost to the resiliency or 

resolvability of the banking system.  My colleague and Chairman-nominee Jay Powell spoke 

about five of these areas last summer when he served as the Board’s oversight governor for 

supervision and regulation: small bank capital simplification, burden reduction in resolution 

planning, enhancements to stress testing, leverage ratio recalibration, and Volcker rule

simplification.2  I wholeheartedly support these initiatives, and I am pleased that some of them 

have progressed even in the months since the summer.  

The banking agencies recently proposed changes to the capital rules for smaller firms, 

consistent with last year’s Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act report, 

which is a positive step toward meaningful burden relief for smaller banks.3  The Federal 

Reserve, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, extended the upcoming 

resolution planning cycles for the eight most systemic domestic banking firms and for foreign 

banks with limited U.S. operations in order to allow for more time between submissions.4  I 

believe we should continue to improve the resolution planning process in light of the substantial 

progress made by firms over the past few years, including a permanent extension of submission 

cycles from annual to once every two years and reduced burden for banking firms with less 

significant systemic footprints.  And, most recently, the Federal Reserve released a package of 

proposed enhancements to the transparency of our stress testing program, which is currently out 

for comment.5  The progress you have seen in those areas represents constructive early steps. 

 Leverage ratio recalibration also is among the Federal Reserve’s highest-priority, near-

term initiatives.  We have made considerable progress on that front in the past few months, and I 

expect that you will see a proposal on this topic relatively soon.  Finally, the relevant agencies 

have begun work on a proposal to streamline the Volcker rule.  This project is a quite

comprehensive and substantial undertaking as well as a five-agency endeavor.  As such, it will 

naturally take a bit of work for the agencies to congeal around a thoughtful Volcker rule 2.0 

proposal for public review.  Volcker rule reform remains a priority in the Federal Reserve’s 

regulatory efforts.  

Emerging Areas for Review 

With that update on the familiar, I will turn to my own impressions of what is next for 

post-crisis regulation.  In my early days as the Vice Chairman for Supervision, I asked our staff 

to conduct a comprehensive review of the regulations in the core areas of reform that I outlined 

earlier--capital, stress testing, liquidity, and resolution.  The objective is to consider the effect of 

those regulatory frameworks on resiliency and resolvability of the financial system, on credit 

availability and economic growth, and more broadly to evaluate their costs and benefits.  This is 

a comprehensive and serious process, and work is still underway.  I should note, however, that I 

have already formed views on a few areas that warrant more focus, and that I will be working 

with my colleagues on the Board to constructively consider.   

I will start with the issue of tailoring supervision and regulation to the size, systemic 

footprint, risk profile, and business model of banking firms.  The Federal Reserve has devoted 

considerable energy in its post-crisis regulatory work to incorporate the tailoring concept in its 

regulation and supervision across the spectrum of small, medium, and large firms.  A recent 

example of this approach is our late 2017 proposal to simplify capital requirements for small- 

and medium-sized banking firms.  In my view, there is further work for the Federal Reserve and 

the other banking agencies to do on the tailoring front.   

I would emphasize that tailoring is not an objective limited in scope to a subset of the 

smallest firms.  As my colleagues and I have said before, the character of our regulation should 


- 6 - 
 

match the character of the risk at the institution.  Accordingly, we should also be looking at 

additional opportunities for more tailoring for larger, non-Global Systemically Important Banks, 

or non-G-SIBs. In this regard, I support congressional efforts regarding tailoring, whether by 

raising the current $50 billion statutory threshold for application of enhanced prudential 

standards or by articulating a so-called factors-based threshold.  Irrespective of where the 

legislative efforts land, I believe we at the Federal Reserve have the responsibility to ensure that 

we do further tailoring for the institutions that remain subject to our rules to ensure that 

regulation matches the risk of the firm.  

Take for example large non-G-SIBs whose failure would not individually pose a risk to 

U.S. financial stability.  Even without financial stability implications, the distress or failure of 

these firms still could harm the U.S. economy by, for example, significantly disrupting the flow 

of credit to households and businesses.  In my view, this tranche of the U.S. banking system 

ought to be subject to regulations that are generally stricter than those that apply to small banking 

firms, but that are also meaningfully less strict than those that apply to the G-SIBs.  The Board 

has effected this sort of G-SIB versus non-G-SIB tailoring among large banks in many areas of 

the regulatory framework.  Most notably, each of the risk-based capital requirements, leverage 

requirements, stress testing requirements, and total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) requirements 

is calibrated substantially more strictly for G-SIBs than for large non-G-SIBs.  However, in some 

key regulations, there is no distinction between the requirements for large non-G-SIBs and G-

SIBs.  

Liquidity regulation, for example, does not have a G-SIB versus non-G-SIB gradation.  In 

particular, the full liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement and internal stress testing 

requirements of enhanced prudential standards apply to large, non-G-SIB banks in the same way 


- 7 - 
 

that they apply to G-SIB banks.  I believe it is time to take concrete steps toward calibrating 

liquidity requirements differently for large, non-G-SIBs than for G-SIBs.  And I see prospects for 

further liquidity tailoring in that the content and frequency of LCR reporting are the same for the 

range of firms currently subject to the modified LCR as they are for the large non-G-SIBs that 

are subject to the full LCR.  We should also explore opportunities to apply additional tailoring 

for these firms in other areas, such as single counterparty credit limits and resolution planning 

requirements. 

Another area that I think we should revisit are the “advanced approaches” thresholds that 

identify internationally active banks.  These thresholds are significant not only for identifying 

which banking firms are subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements, but 

also for identifying which firms are subject to various other Basel Committee standards, such as 

the supplementary leverage ratio, the countercyclical capital buffer, and the LCR.  The metrics 

used to identify internationally active firms--$250 billion in total assets or $10 billion in on-

balance-sheet foreign exposures--were formulated well over a decade ago, were the result of a 

defensible but not ineluctable analysis, and have not been refined since then.  We should explore 

ways to bring these criteria into better alignment with our objectives.  

A third area in which I will be working with my Board colleagues is a meaningful 

simplification of our framework of loss absorbency requirements.  There are different ways to 

count the number of loss absorbency constraints that our large banking firms face--which is 

perhaps in itself an indication of a surfeit of complexity if we can’t be perfectly sure of how to 

count them--but the number I come up with is 24 total requirements in the framework.  While I 

do not know precisely the socially optimal number of loss absorbency requirements for large 

banking firms, I am reasonably certain that 24 is too many.  Candidates for simplification 


- 8 - 
 

include: elimination of the advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements; one or more 

ratios in stress testing; and some simplification of our TLAC rule.  I am not the first Federal 

Reserve governor to mention some of these possibilities, and we should put them back on the 

table in the context of a more holistic discussion of streamlining these requirements.  Let me be 

clear, however, that while I am advocating a simplification of large bank loss absorbency 

requirements, I am not advocating an enervation of the regulatory capital regime applicable to 

large banking firms.  

Although not a post-crisis regulation, the Board’s complex and occasionally opaque 

framework for making determinations of control under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC 

Act) is another area that is ripe for re-examination through the lenses of efficiency, transparency, 

and simplicity.  As you know, a determination of control under the BHC Act is significant 

because even remote entities in a controlled group can be subject to the BHC Act’s restrictions 

on activities and a host of other regulatory requirements.  Under the Board’s control framework--

built up piecemeal over many decades--the practical determinants of when one company is 

deemed to control another are now quite a bit more ornate than the basic standards set forth in 

the statute and in some cases cannot be discovered except through supplication to someone who 

has spent a long apprenticeship in the art of Fed interpretation.  The process can be burdensome 

and time-consuming both for the requester and Federal Reserve staff.  We are taking a serious 

look at rationalizing and recalibrating this framework.   

Finally, as I mentioned earlier, an enhanced stress testing transparency package was 

released for public comment last month.  I personally believe that our stress testing disclosures 

can go further.  I appreciate the risks to the financial system of the industry converging on the 

Federal Reserve’s stress testing model too completely, so I am hesitant to support complete 


- 9 - 
 

disclosure of our models for that reason.  However, I believe that the disclosure we have 

provided does not go far enough to provide visibility into the supervisory models that often 

deliver a firm’s binding capital constraint.  It is important in any proposal to receive comments, 

and I can say that I and my colleagues on the Board will be paying particularly close attention to 

your comments on how we might improve this current proposal. 

Concluding Remarks 

 To conclude, I hope that these remarks give you a sense of our approach to analyzing and 

improving post-crisis regulation.  As I mentioned earlier, the areas of core reform--capital, 

liquidity, stress testing, and resolution--have produced a stronger and more resilient system and 

should be preserved.  We have made great progress, but there is further work to do.  Some clear 

improvements are in the offing in the relatively near future.  Other areas will benefit from longer 

term discussion.  I look forward to engaging with you and the public more broadly as I help to 

chart a course for the important work ahead.
