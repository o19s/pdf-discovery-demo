Bank Structure Conference 


Chicago 








May 8, 2014



Among the questions posed by the organizers of this 50
th

 Annual Conference on Bank 

Structure and Competition is how the “regulatory-supervisory framework has fundamentally 

changed.”   I think one answer is that the aims and scope of prudential regulation have been 

fundamentally redefined since the financial crisis.  Most significantly, a concern with financial 

stability and an increased emphasis on macroprudential regulation have informed major changes 

in both banking law and supervision.  This salutary shift in perspective has important 

implications for prudential regulation.  One is that prudential regulation must deal with threats to 

financial stability whether or not those threats emanate from traditional banking organizations.  

Hence the need to broaden the perimeter of prudential regulation, both to certain nonbank 

financial institutions and to certain activities by all financial actors.  

A second implication—to which I will devote most of my remarks this morning—is that 

the aims of prudential regulation for traditional banking organizations should vary according to 

the size, scope, and range of activities of the organizations.  By specifying these aims with more 

precision, we can shape both a more effective regulatory system and a more efficient one.  That 

is, once we have specified the regulatory aims for a particular type of financial institution, we 

can more effectively rationalize and, as appropriate, differentiate the rules and requirements to be 

applied to each kind of institution.   

The Legacy of a Unitary Approach to Bank Regulation 

 When I was teaching banking law prior to my appointment to the Board of Governors, I 

noticed an interesting disconnect in the best casebooks in the field.  An introductory chapter on 

the history and purposes of bank regulation revealed a complicated set of issues concerning 

changes in the structure and activities of banks, which, among other things, suggested that the 

rationales for regulating banks might vary depending on the size, business model, and affiliations 


- 2 - 
 


of a bank.  Yet the remaining chapters of the casebooks treated bank regulation as a more or less 

unitary endeavor—with prudential rules applicable in about the same way to the activities and 

affiliations of all banking organizations, and only to banking organizations.   

To be sure, topics such as bank affiliations with nonbank financial institutions were, for 

practical reasons, more focused on larger banks.  And there were a few measures directed at the 

more complicated balance sheets of larger banks, such as the Basel II internal ratings-based 

(IRB) approach to regulatory capital, although there was no evidence the underlying purpose of 

capital regulation differed.  But in all the chapters elaborating applicable doctrine and rules, there 

was little hint that the purposes and principles of bank regulation might vary across the bank 

population.  And, to the extent that nonbank financial institutions such as broker-dealers, 

investment companies, or insurance companies were covered, the pedagogical point seemed to 

be that the aims of regulating these kinds of firms were dominantly investor and customer 

protection—not prudential considerations such as limiting moral hazard, much less fostering 

financial stability. 

 The reason for this disconnect was, to a great extent, that pre-crisis statutes and 

regulations reflected what I have termed a unitary approach to banking regulation.  The core of 

banking regulation could be explained with a relatively simple narrative, by which deposit 

insurance and access to the discount window had been granted to depository institutions in order 

to forestall runs and panics.  The resulting moral hazard and the use of insured deposits as a 

funding source for these institutions justified everything from capital requirements to limitations 

on banks getting into nonbanking businesses.  Even when traditional banks were permitted to 

affiliate with other kinds of financial firms, laws such as the Bank Holding Company Act

 were oriented mostly toward protecting the insured 

depository institution and the federal deposit insurance fund (DIF) from possible depredation by 

those nonbank  businesses.  The activities of broker-dealers, for example, were relevant to 

prudential regulation only insofar as they affected an affiliated depository institution.   

 Of course, banking law had not only tried to protect the DIF from the risky activities of 

banks and their affiliates.  It had also, albeit far less explicitly, tried to protect banks from 

nonbank competition and, to some degree, from each other.
3
  Just as banks were supposed to 

stick to their knitting—the business of banking—so everyone else was supposed to stay out of 

that business.  But as we all know, the distinction between demand for commercial bank loans 

and for investment bank underwriting of public debt issuance was never absolute, and in the 

1970s it began to erode more rapidly with the growth of capital markets and financial 

innovations such as money market funds.   

The financial crisis has confirmed that the pre-crisis regulatory structure reflected a view 

of the financial system that was at once too broad and too narrow.  It was too broad in that 

prudential rules generally applied to all banks and bank holding companies through a 

microprudential approach focused on the soundness of each individual bank.  The rules were 

implemented somewhat differently, based on the size and relative complexity of banking 

organizations, and separate supervisory portfolios were created.  But the principles informing 

regulation were basically the same whether the institution was a community bank or a holding 

company with a $1 trillion balance sheet whose failure might shake the entire financial system.

 For example, restrictions on branching across state lines and, in some cases, within states limited competition 

significantly until they were loosened through statutory changes, such as the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking & 

Branching Efficiency Act, P.L. 103-328 (1994).

The prudential regulatory structure was too narrow in that it did not extend to firms and 

activities outside of banking organizations, even those that could pose a threat to financial 

stability, because the soundness of the federal deposit insurance system was not implicated.  

Thus Lehman Brothers, whose failure did seriously shake the financial system, was not subject to 

even the microprudential standards applicable to bank holding companies.  The run on the repo 

market involved a wide range of market actors of different sizes, operating under different 

regulatory constraints.   

Redefining Prudential Regulation 

 It is important to recognize that the statutory and administrative changes in regulation 

following the financial crisis were not only about strengthening existing regulation following 30 

years of largely deregulatory measures that had preceded the crisis.  The turmoil that attended the 

collapse of several large nonbank financial institutions, and the extraordinary government 

measures necessary to contain that turmoil, had quickly changed into a consensus—previously 

the minority view—that prudential regulation should be broadened to better safeguard the 

financial system as a whole.  This perspective was embraced by Congress in the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), which directed federal banking 

and market regulators to add to their existing mandates the responsibility for protecting financial 

stability.  Dodd-Frank provided numerous new authorities for executing this new mission. 

  One regulatory innovation in Dodd-Frank that is particularly salient for present purposes 

was the creation of different categories of banking organizations—largely, but not exclusively, 

on the basis of total assets—to which different regulatory requirements are to apply.  Most 

prominently, section 165 requires that “in order to prevent or mitigate risks to the financial 

stability of the United States,” the Federal Reserve Board is to establish for all bank holding 


- 5 - 
 


companies with at least $50 billion in assets prudential standards that “are more stringent” than 

generally applicable standards and that “increase in stringency” based on a variety of factors 

related to the systemic importance of these institutions.
4
  These standards must cover capital, 

liquidity, risk management, resolution planning, and concentration limits; the Federal Reserve 

may add other standards as it finds appropriate.
5
  Section 165 also establishes requirements for 

the establishment of a risk committee and for stress testing, but these are applicable in at least 

some respects to all bank holding companies with at least $10 billion in assets.   

 In implementing the section 165 requirement of increasing stringency for enhanced 

prudential standards applicable to banking organizations of increasing systemic importance, the 

Federal Reserve has essentially created several categories within the universe of banking 

organizations with $50 billion or more in assets.  All firms in this universe will be subject to the 

basic enhanced standards, including supervisory stress tests, capital plan submissions, resolution 

plan requirements, single counterparty credit limits, and a modified form of the Liquidity 

Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement that was part of Basel III.  Firms with at least $250 billion in 

assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign assets are also subject to the advanced approach 

risk-based capital requirements of Basel II, the Basel III supplementary leverage ratio, the full 

LCR requirement, and the countercyclical capital buffer provision of Basel III.
6
  The eight U.S. 

firms designated as global systemically important banks will be additionally subject to risk-based 

capital surcharges, the enhanced Basel III supplementary leverage ratio, tighter single 

counterparty credit limits, and a long-term debt requirement designed to support the 

                                                           
4
 Section 165 of Dodd-Frank also requires that these special prudential standards apply to any nonbank financial 

company designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. 
5
 Dodd-Frank also uses the $50 billion threshold in other parts of the law, such as to define the universe of firms that 

must pay the Federal Reserve for the cost of examination and supervision, and that are subject to ex post 

assessments in the event that taxpayers were to bear any loss as a result of the resolution of a firm under Title II of 

the law. 
6
 The $250 billion/$10 billion threshold does not appear in Dodd-Frank.  It was a pre-existing regulatory category 

created to identify the firms subject to the so-called advanced approaches risk-based capital requirements of Basel II.

effectiveness of orderly resolution processes.  In addition, the supervision of these firms is 

overseen by the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee (LISCC), an inter-

disciplinary group created by the Federal Reserve Board in 2010.
7
 

 Thus, there are regulatory categories for banks with $10 billion or more in assets, with 

$50 billion in assets, with either $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in foreign assets, and with a 

combination of large asset holdings and other characteristics that have resulted in their being 

designated of global systemic importance.  In fact, Dodd-Frank creates another category of banks 

in making its provision on incentive compensation applicable to banking organizations with at 

least $1 billion in assets.  Clearly, the unitary approach of the pre-crisis period has been 

abandoned.  This is an important move in the right direction.  But in terms of differentiating 

regulatory aims, Dodd-Frank really identifies only one additional objective—that of preventing 

or mitigating risks to U.S. financial stability.  By developing this objective a bit more, and by 

introducing other salient considerations, we may be able to specify the varying aims of 

regulation for different kinds of banks in a manner that helps us rationalize applicable regulatory 

structures.  

Specifying Regulatory Aims 

 Let me begin with what I regard as relatively straightforward cases in specifying 

regulatory aims—those of the very largest banking organizations and of small ones.  The largest, 

of course, have commanded enormous attention, with too-big-to-fail concerns often dominating 

the public debate on regulatory reform in the aftermath of the financial crisis.  There is now a 

consensus among banking authorities, both U.S. and foreign, that the failure of financial

institutions of sufficient combined size, interconnectedness, and leverage could threaten the 

entire financial system, and, therefore, must be subject to a stricter regulatory regime. 

The special regulatory aims for such institutions should reflect this systemic focus.  The 

very large negative externalities associated with such failures could be realized through a classic 

domino effect or through contagion effects.  As the financial crisis showed, losses in a tail event 

are likely to be correlated for large firms deeply engaged in trading, structured products, and 

other capital market instruments, and relying on similar sources of short-term funding.  Thus, the 

regulatory framework should aim to reduce the chances of distress or failure at such firms to a 

greater extent than traditional, microprudential regulation would.  Moreover, it should explicitly 

take into account the correlations and inter-dependencies in asset holdings and funding.  Finally, 

the regulatory system should aim to offset the perception of too-big-to-fail status, which carries 

with it the possibility of funding advantages in normal times, and protection of creditors and 

perhaps even shareholders in highly stressed times.  The systemic perspective and consequent 

aim of protecting financial stability argue for the stronger and broader regulatory measures that 

have been undertaken in recent years.  

At the other end of the spectrum are community banks, conventionally defined as those 

with less than $10 billion in assets.  The roughly 5,700 banks in this group constitute 98 percent 

of insured commercial banks in the United States, but hold just under 20 percent of the aggregate 

assets of all commercial banks.  Indeed, 90 percent of community banks are what supervisors 

classify as “small” community banks—those with less than $1 billion in assets.  While these 

banks will suffer the fallout from systemic problems, they are unlikely to cause such problems.  

The regulatory aim, therefore, is about as close as can be to the traditional microprudential bank 

regulatory aims of protecting the federal DIF and limiting the use of insured deposits by 


- 8 - 
 


restricting the scope of bank activities.  It is true that the relative lack of geographic and portfolio 

diversification in many community banks can make them vulnerable to localized economic 

problems.  But that is just the kind of problem that traditional microprudential regulation has 

been concerned with addressing. 

What, then, of the 80 or so U.S. banks that have assets of $10 billion or more, but are not 

among the eight large, complex institutions that have been designated of global systemic 

importance?  Obviously they vary enormously in size, from just over $10 billion in assets all the 

way up to very large regional banks with hundreds of billions in assets.  They bridge the $50 

billion threshold for enhanced prudential standards established by Dodd-Frank.  Yet, whatever 

their size, most banking organizations in this group are overwhelmingly recognizable as 

traditional commercial banks (though a few do have significant capital market or other 

activities).  

 It is with this similarity in mind that some executives of some pretty sizable banks have 

described their institutions to me as essentially a community bank, but with a bigger balance 

sheet.  But there are at least two reasons why the aims for prudential regulation of such 

institutions might reach beyond conventional microprudential purposes.  First, some at the higher 

end of this range may have a large enough systemic footprint that their stress or failure could 

have material effects on the rest of the financial system, though less than the LISCC firms.  

Second, more than one-third of U.S. commercial banking assets are held by these 80 banks.  If a 

number of these banks simultaneously came under pressure or failed, a harmful contraction of 

credit availability in significant regions or sectors of the economy could ensue, even if there were 

little chance of a financial crisis.  Thus, particularly to the degree that there are correlations in the 


- 9 - 
 


risks associated with loans held across such institutions, there should be a macroprudential 

objective in the regulation of at least some of these firms.   

 Of course, I would not lump all 80 of these institutions into the same category for 

purposes of specifying the aims of regulation.  In particular, only a small fraction of these firms 

have a significant enough systemic footprint that their stress or failure would impose sizable 

negative externalities on the rest of the financial system.  And the lines delineating the possible 

categories are not as easy to draw as for community banks and LISCC firms.  Nonetheless, I will 

suggest in a few moments some possible classifications for this group of banks, along with 

examples of the varying regulations that might apply. 

Rationalizing the Regulatory Framework 

   The preceding observations have portrayed the prudential regulatory framework as one 

that should be constructed with different aims in mind.  With respect to all depository 

institutions, this framework maintains the traditional aim of protecting the DIF and limiting the 

use of insured deposits to engage in nonbank activities.  With respect to banks of a certain size—

even those predominantly involved in conventional lending activities—a macroprudential aim 

should be added.  Finally, with respect to banking organizations of such size and complexity that 

serious stress or failure could pose risks to the entire financial system, a financial stability aim 

should be the basis for additional forms of regulation.  As suggested in section 165 of Dodd-

Frank, the stringency of these additional regulations should increase in proportion to the systemic 

importance of the banking organizations. 

 Let me now give a few examples of how specifying these aims can help us think through 

ways in which the current overlays of regulatory and supervisory requirements might be 

rationalized.  In part, such a rationalization is motivated by the familiar goal of limiting 


- 10 - 
 


regulatory costs that are not necessary to achieve a given set of regulatory aims, thereby lowering 

the cost of the underlying economic activity.  But it is also motivated by the advantage to be 

gained if supervisory resources can be deployed where their payoff in achieving well-specified 

regulatory aims will be highest.   

Community banks.  I will begin again with community banks.  Community bankers often 

argue that they are subject to a range of rules and requirements that are not really necessary 

given the relevant regulatory aim which, as previously suggested, is quite straightforward.  That 

regulatory aim needs to be implemented with an eye to the context in which community banks 

operate.  One obvious point of context is that any regulatory requirement is likely to be 

disproportionately costly for community banks, since the fixed costs associated with compliance 

must be spread over a smaller base of assets.   

A second important point of context is the business model of community banks.  As is 

well-known, over the past few decades they have substantially reduced their presence in lines of 

business such as consumer lending in the face of competition from larger banks benefiting from 

economies of scale.  Today, as a group, their most important forms of lending are to small- and 

medium-sized businesses.  Smaller community banks—those with less than $1 billion in assets—

account for nearly a quarter of commercial and industrial lending, and nearly 40 percent of 

commercial real estate lending, to small- and medium-sized businesses, despite their having less 

than 10 percent of total commercial banking assets. 

This state of affairs is not surprising when one considers that credit extension to smaller 

firms is an area in which the relationship lending model of community banks retains a 

comparative advantage.  It means that community banks are of special significance to local 

economies.  It also means that, particularly in rural areas, the disappearance of community banks 


- 11 - 
 


could augur a permanent falloff in this kind of credit, at least a portion of which may not be 

maintained in the more standardized approach to lending characteristic of larger banks.   

 Banking regulators have taken a number of steps to try to avoid unnecessary regulatory 

costs for community banks, such as fashioning simpler compliance requirements and identifying 

which provisions of new regulations are of relevance to smaller banks.  But a number of new 

statutory provisions apply explicitly to some smaller banks or, by failing to exclude any banks 

from coverage, apply to all banks.  This means that smaller banks do need to expend at least 

some compliance effort.  And, even where regulatory frameworks try to place a lesser burden on 

smaller banks, there may be some risk of “supervisory trickle down,” whereby supervisors 

informally, and perhaps not wholly intentionally, create compliance expectations for smaller 

banks that resemble expectations created for larger institutions. 

 It would be worthwhile to have a policy discussion of statutes that might be amended 

explicitly to exclude community banks (which, again, are generally defined as those with less 

than $10 billion in assets) from their coverage.  In my view, two candidates would be the 

Volcker rule and the incentive compensation requirements in section 956 of Dodd-Frank.  The 

concerns addressed by these statutory provisions are substantially greater at larger institutions 

and, even where a practice at a smaller bank might raise concerns, the supervisory process 

remains available to address what would likely be unusual circumstances.  Indeed, relieving both 

banks and supervisors of the need to focus on formal compliance with a range of regulations less 

relevant to community bank practice would free them to focus on the actual problems that may 

exist at smaller banks.     

 Middle-range banks.   As I have already suggested, financial stability and 

macroprudential aims do not apply equally to all 80 of the banks in this wide category of firms 


- 12 - 
 


holding over $10 billion in assets, other than the LISCC banking organizations.  While it is 

reasonable to adopt a macroprudential aim for all firms in this category, few of these banks have 

the kind of systemic footprint that would warrant extensive special regulation for financial 

stability purposes.  In establishing requirements for firm (though not supervisory) stress testing 

and risk-management committees for all bank holding companies in this group, but mandating 

that only bank holding companies of $50 billion or more be subject to enhanced prudential 

standards, Congress has reflected a similar judgment.  The key question is whether $50 billion is 

the right line to have drawn.   

 Experience to date suggests to me, at least, that the line might better be drawn at a higher 

asset level—$100 billion, perhaps.   Requirements such as resolution planning and the quite 

elaborate requirements of our supervisory stress testing process do not seem to me to be 

necessary for banks between $50 billion and $100 billion in assets.  If the line were redrawn at a 

higher figure, we might explore simpler methods for promoting macroprudential aims with 

respect to banks above $10 billion in assets but below the new threshold. 

 Were such a change to be adopted, bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in 

assets would not be subject to any of the enhanced prudential requirements of section 165 of 

Dodd-Frank; bank holding companies with assets between $100 billion and $250 billion would 

be subject to supervisory stress testing and a basic set of the section 165 requirements; and 

holding companies with $250 billion or more in assets would be subject to the supplementary 

leverage ratio, the full LCR, and the countercyclical capital buffer provision.  Of course, this is 

not the only way to draw the lines, and there could be reasons for applying additional 

requirements to specific banks, even if they fall below the presumptive asset threshold.  But I use 


- 13 - 
 


this example to illustrate how the specification of aims and the progressive stringency of section 

165 could be usefully combined. 

 Largest institutions.  Specifying prudential regulatory aims in the context of community 

and middle-range banks suggests a rationalization that could possibly eliminate certain 

requirements as they apply to some of these banks.  In the case of the LISCC institutions, 

however, I believe there are additional requirements needed to implement prudential aims 

associated with financial stability.  These include capital surcharges and minimum amounts of 

“gone concern” loss absorbing capacity, among others.  Most important is continued work on the 

vulnerabilities posed by short-term wholesale funding and, more generally, by large trading 

books, including maturity matched books of securities financing transactions.  The regulatory 

response to these vulnerabilities will likely require some combination of measures directed at 

capital, liquidity requirements, and resolution procedures.  There is also a need for a 

complementary set of measures such as minimum margining requirements applicable to all 

securities financing transactions, whether or not they involve systemically important firms. 

But there are some opportunities for rationalization even with respect to regulation of the 

larger institutions.  While necessary new rules will now be applied to these institutions, vestiges 

of the pre-crisis regulatory approach that did not rest on well-specified regulatory aims are still in 

place and might sensibly be modified or removed.  Most prominent in this regard is the Basel II 

IRB approach for risk-weighted capital requirements.  The IRB approach, which generally 

applies in the United States to all bank holding companies with $250 billion or more in assets, 

was developed a decade ago in an effort to align risk weightings more closely to the increasingly 

sophisticated quantitative risk-assessment techniques in the financial industry.   


- 14 - 
 


At the time of its development, the IRB approach seemed intended to result in a modest 

decline in risk-weighted capital requirements, a goal that the financial crisis revealed to be badly 

misguided.  But even with the higher capital ratios required by Basel III, the IRB approach is 

problematic.  The combined complexity and opacity of risk weights generated by each banking 

organization for purposes of its regulatory capital requirement create manifold risks of gaming, 

mistake, and monitoring difficulty.  The IRB approach contributes little to market understanding 

of large banks’ balance sheets, and thus fails to strengthen market discipline.  And the relatively 

short, backward-looking basis for generating risk weights makes the resulting capital standards 

likely to be excessively pro-cyclical and insufficiently sensitive to tail risk.  That is, the IRB 

approach—for all its complexity and expense—does not do a very good job of advancing the 

financial stability and macroprudential aims of prudential regulation.  Yet a capital measure that 

incorporates these aims is precisely what is needed to complement the traditional 

microprudential elements of our capital standards. 

 The supervisory stress tests developed by the Federal Reserve over the past five years 

provide a much better risk-sensitive basis for setting minimum capital requirements.  They do 

not rely on firms’ own loss estimates.  They are based on adverse scenarios that would affect the 

entire economy and take correlated asset holdings into account.  As we gain experience, we have 

been enhancing the macroprudential features of the annual stress test exercise.  And, of course, 

the disclosure of the results helps inform counterparties and investors, thereby increasing market 

discipline.  They are undoubtedly a substantial amount of work for both the banks and 

supervisors but, unlike the IRB approach, the benefits seem worth the work.

8
 Under the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review program, bank holding companies 

participating in the supervisory stress tests must demonstrate their capacity for sound quantitative risk assessment 

and management, but not for purposes of setting regulatory capital requirements. 


- 15 - 
 


  For all these reasons, I believe we should consider discarding the IRB approach to risk-

weighted capital requirements.  With the Collins Amendment
9
 providing a standardized, 

statutory floor for risk-based capital; the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio providing a 

stronger back-up capital measure; and the stress tests providing a better risk-sensitive measure 

that incorporates a macroprudential dimension, the IRB approach has little useful role to play.  

We would continue to expect that firms practice sound quantitative risk management using 

internal models and other techniques.  Indeed, the qualitative assessment included in our annual 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise is designed to ensure that the 

firms have this capacity.  But, in light of all that has happened in the last decade, I see little 

reason to maintain the requirements of the IRB approach for our largest banks. 

Of course, the IRB approach was agreed internationally as part of the Basel II framework 

concluded in 2004.  It would be best if all the Basel Committee countries moved together to 

adopt standardized risk-weighted and supervisory stress testing requirements for all 

internationally active banks.  This would be a somewhat complicated shift for a number of 

reasons, including the likely appropriateness of applying different adverse scenarios for different 

parts of the world and the challenges in conducting a peer review at the Basel Committee of 

supervisory stress tests by member countries.  Yet, as documented by the Basel Committee’s 

work on divergence in risk weightings by banks applying IRB methods, Basel II created its own 

problems of consistency and transparency.  There is no reason to believe that the task of creating 

an oversight and review framework for supervisory stress testing would be any more difficult.

 Section 171 of Dodd-Frank, popularly known as the Collins Amendment, requires that the federal banking 

agencies establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all banking organizations that are not less than 

“generally applicable” risk-based capital requirements.

Conclusion 

 In practical terms, the unitary approach to banking regulation has been supplanted by 

various statutory, regulatory, and supervisory responses to the financial crisis.  In particular, the 

aim of protecting financial stability has figured prominently in those responses, though a broader 

macroprudential aim can be detected as well.  I have tried today to suggest that an explicit effort 

to specify relevant aims as they pertain to different kinds of banking organizations can provide a 

basis for rationalizing applicable regulatory frameworks—sometimes by paring back or 

foregoing regulation for certain kinds of firms, and sometimes by adding a regulatory measure 

where the relevant aim has not been adequately promoted by existing measures. 

 By design and necessity, I have offered only a handful of illustrations as to how this 

perspective might lead to certain regulatory changes.  I look forward to debate on the merits of 

these, and other, possible implications of a more precise specification of prudential regulatory 

aims.  I also look forward to seeing new editions of banking law casebooks that differentiate 

regulatory measures with an eye to these multiple aims and their differential application to 

various banking organizations.
