When the central banks in many advanced economies embarked on 

unconventional monetary policy, it raised concerns that there might be differences in the 

cross-border transmission of unconventional relative to conventional monetary policy.1  

These concerns were sufficient to warrant a special Group of Seven (G-7) statement in 

2013 establishing ground rules to address possible exchange rate effects of the changing 

composition of monetary policy.2  

Today the world confronts similar questions in reverse.  In the United States, in 

my assessment, normalization of the federal funds rate is now well under way, and the 

Federal Reserve is advancing plans to allow the balance sheet to run off at a gradual and 

predictable pace.  And for the first time in many years, the global economy is 

experiencing synchronous growth, and authorities in the euro area and the United 

Kingdom are beginning to discuss the time when the need for monetary accommodation 

will diminish.  

Unlike in previous tightening cycles, many central banks currently have two tools 

for removing accommodation.  They can therefore pursue alternative normalization 

strategies--first seeking to guide policy rates higher before initiating balance sheet runoff, 

as in the United States, or instead starting to shrink the balance sheet before initiating a

remain oriented towards meeting our respective domestic objectives using domestic instruments, and that 
we will not target exchange rates.”  See Group of Seven (2013), “Statement by G7 Finance Ministers and 
Central Bank Governors,” February 12, paragraph 1, www.g8.utoronto.ca/finance/fm130212.htm.  The 
corresponding Group of Twenty statement included the new commitment:  “We will not target our 
exchange rates for competitive purposes.”  See Group of Twenty (2013), “Communiqué of Meeting of G20 
Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors,” February 16, paragraph 5,

tightening of short-term rates, or undertaking both in tandem.  Shrinking the balance 

sheet and raising the policy rate can both contribute to achieving the domestic goals of 

monetary policy, but it is an open question whether alternative normalization approaches 

might have materially different implications for the composition of demand and for cross-

border spillovers, including through exchange rates and other financial channels.   

Before discussing the cross-border effects of normalization, it is worth noting that 

the two tools for removing accommodation--raising policy rates and reducing central 

bank balance sheets--appear to affect domestic output and inflation in a qualitatively 

similar way.  This means that central banks can substitute between raising the policy rate 

and shrinking the balance sheet to remove accommodation, just as both were used to 

support the recovery following the Great Recession.   

Insofar as a range of approaches is likely to be consistent with achieving a central 

bank’s domestic objectives, the choice of normalization strategy may be influenced by 

other considerations, including the ease of implementing and communicating policy 

changes, or the desire to minimize possible credit market distortions associated with the 

balance sheet.  In the case of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) decided to delay balance sheet normalization until the federal funds rate had 

reached a high enough level to enable it to be cut materially if economic conditions 

deteriorate, thus guarding against the risk of returning to the effective lower bound (ELB) 

in an environment with a historically low neutral interest rate.3  The greater familiarity 

and past experience with the federal funds rate also weighed in favor of this instrument

initially.  Separately, for those central banks that, unlike the Federal Reserve, moved to 

negative interest rates, there may be special considerations associated with raising policy 

rates back into positive territory.   

One question that naturally arises is whether the major central banks’ 

normalization plans may have material implications for cross-border spillovers--an 

important issue that until very recently had received scant attention.  This question is a 

natural extension of the literature examining the cross-border spillovers of the 

unconventional policy actions taken by the major central banks to provide 

accommodation.   

Although this literature suggests there are good reasons to expect broadly similar 

cross-border spillovers from tightening through policy rates as through balance sheet 

runoff, the effects may not be exactly equivalent.  The balance sheet might affect certain 

aspects of the economy and financial markets differently than the short-term rate due to 

the fact that the balance sheet more directly affects term premiums on longer-term 

securities, while the short-term rate more directly affects money market rates.  As a 

result, similar to the domestic effects, while the international spillovers of conventional 

and unconventional monetary policy may operate broadly similarly, the relative 

magnitude of the different channels may be sufficiently different that, on net, the two 

policy strategies have distinct effects.  For example, as will be discussed at greater length 

shortly, the two strategies may have very different implications for the exchange rate.  

Moreover, as was evident with the European Central Bank’s (ECB) asset purchases in 

late 2014 and early 2015, and as we have seen again in reverse in recent weeks, in 

addition to the standard demand and exchange rate channels, expected or actual asset

purchases may have spillovers to foreign financial conditions--by lowering term 

premiums and the associated longer-term foreign bond yields--that are greater than 

conventional monetary policy.    

To explore possible differences, it is useful to compare two different approaches 

to policy normalization, each of which is designed to have identical effects on aggregate 

domestic activity and thus, at least in the long run, on inflation.  At one extreme, a central 

bank could opt to tighten primarily through conventional policy hikes, while maintaining 

the balance sheet by reinvesting the proceeds of maturing assets.  At the other extreme, a 

central bank could rely primarily on reducing the balance sheet, while keeping policy 

rates unchanged in the near term. 

The question is whether there are circumstances in which the choice of 

normalization strategies, which are similarly effective in achieving domestic mandates, 

might matter for the global economy.  Where the two approaches have entirely equivalent 

effects, the central bank could freely substitute between them without changing the 

composition of home demand, and net exports, the exchange rate, and foreign output 

would also be unaffected.   

Conversely, under different assumptions about the transmission channels of 

monetary policy, alternative approaches to normalization can have quite different 

implications for foreign economies.  Most prominently, the exchange rate may be more 

sensitive to the path of short term rates than to balance sheet adjustments, as some 

research suggests.4  Although several papers using an event study approach find on 

balance little disparity in the exchange rate sensitivity to short-term compared to long-

                                                 
4 See, for instance, Stavrakeva and Tang (2016).  


 - 5 - 

term interest rates, this lack of empirical consensus may simply reflect the difficulty of 

disentangling changes in short-term and longer-term interest rates, which are highly 

correlated.5 

Indeed, the greater sensitivity of exchange rates to expected short-term interest 

rates than to term premiums was a key rationale behind the Operation Twist strategy in 

the early 1960s.6  Under Operation Twist, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury made 

large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities to drive down yields and 

stimulate the economy, which was suffering from an unemployment rate of nearly 7 

percent.  This policy was combined with a modest increase in short-term interest rates 

intended to alleviate the capital outflow pressures that threatened the sustainability of the 

Bretton Woods global monetary system.  Ultimately, this policy mix did succeed in 

reducing long-term interest rates, and also contributed to a reduction in private capital 

outflows that relieved pressure on U.S. international reserves, at least for a time.   

Let’s turn to a simulation of a highly stylized model to explore how a greater 

sensitivity of the exchange rate to conventional policy relative to balance sheet actions 

can make a difference in terms of cross-border transmission.  In particular, let’s assume a 

100-basis-point rise in long-term yields coming from the conventional channel of higher 

policy rates has double the effect on the exchange rate as a 100 basis point rise in yields 

coming from higher term premiums.7  If a large country, which is already at potential, 

experiences a favorable domestic demand shock, it would need to tighten monetary 

                                                 
5 See Glick and Leduc (2015), Ferrari, Kearns, and Schrimpf (2016), and Swanson (2017); Swanson 
attempts to identify separately the effects of forward guidance and asset purchases.  
6 See Ross (1966), Modigliani and Sutch (1966), Stein (1965), and Alon and Swanson (2011).   
7 This simulation is shown in figure 1 in the appendix.  The stylized model is composed of two identical 
countries that are linked through trade flows.  The model is calibrated so that either type of policy action 
keeps the home country’s GDP at baseline.

policy to return output to potential.  If the central bank chooses to use the short-term 

interest rate as its active policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, the current and 

expected path of short-term interest rates rises, putting upward pressure on long-term 

bond yields and causing the real exchange rate to appreciate.  The stronger currency 

coupled with some initial expansion of domestic demand in turn cause a deterioration in 

real net exports.   

Turning to the effects abroad, the decline in domestic real net exports corresponds 

to an increase in foreign net exports, which will tend to boost foreign GDP, other things 

being equal.  How this affects a particular foreign economy will depend on its 

circumstances and the corresponding policy response of the foreign central bank.  In the 

case where the foreign economy is pinned at the effective lower bound, the increase in 

net exports will provide a welcome boost to aggregate demand.  By contrast, if foreign 

output is already near potential, the foreign central bank will need to respond by 

tightening policy in order to keep its economy in balance.   

Now, let’s instead consider tightening through the balance sheet.  If the same 

amount of policy tightening in the country experiencing a positive demand shock is 

achieved exclusively through a reduction in the balance sheet, while keeping the policy 

rate unchanged, the exchange rate would appreciate to a smaller degree, reflecting the 

lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to the term premium than to policy rates.  

Net exports would decline by less--reflecting both the smaller exchange rate appreciation 

and the smaller rise in domestic demand--and similarly this would result in smaller cross-

border spillovers to foreign GDP.     


 - 7 - 

Thus, for a foreign economy that is at the effective lower bound, tightening in the 

home country through balance-sheet policy will be less welcome than through short-term 

rates.  The foreign economy will experience less exchange rate depreciation, and so less 

of a boost to net exports.  In addition, the stimulus to the foreign economy could be 

further diluted to the extent that the balance sheet policy boosted term premiums on its 

long-term bonds and hence tightened financial conditions, although this effect has not 

been built into the simulation model.  By contrast, for a foreign economy that is close to 

potential, adjustment through the balance sheet in the home country will mean less of a 

need for the foreign central bank to respond by tightening policy than under home 

country adjustment through conventional policy. 

So far, we have considered the case of central banks with freely floating exchange 

rates and well-anchored inflation expectations.  What about central banks with managed 

exchange rates or weakly anchored inflation expectations?  To keep the analysis simple, 

let’s assume a foreign central bank aims to completely stabilize its exchange rate vis-à-

vis a core country.  Let’s again consider circumstances in which the core country 

experiences a positive demand shock that calls for policy tightening.  Although the 

pegging economy is likely to experience spillovers under either approach to 

normalization in the core country, the spillovers are likely to be greater when the core 

country tightens through the policy rate.  The tightening in the core country will compel 

the country that is fixing its exchange rate to tighten policy in sync and the core country’s 

currency will rise more against its trading partners with conventional tightening, leading 

to greater effective appreciation of the pegging country’s currency as well.  Although the 

pegging economy will benefit somewhat from the stronger demand of the core country, 


 - 8 - 

that benefit is likely to be outweighed by the adverse effects of a tightening of domestic 

monetary policy when domestic conditions would not otherwise call for it.  Such 

considerations may have played a role in the market dynamics experienced by China as 

discussions about initiating rate hikes progressed in the United States in the second half 

of 2015 and early 2016.8     

Next let’s explore alternative approaches to policy normalization by countries 

facing a similar need to tighten.  This question is timely; with synchronous expansions 

now underway, we may be approaching a turning point before too long.  In particular, 

let’s consider the case when two large countries, which are assumed identical for the sake 

of simplicity, experience the same positive shock to domestic demand.  Under these 

assumptions, if both economies were to choose the same normalization strategy--putting 

primary reliance on either the balance sheet or short-term interest rates--the implications 

for the exchange rate and net exports are the same:  In both cases, the exchange rate 

between the two countries does not change, and neither do net exports between the 

countries.  Each central bank would adjust interest rates by the same amount--enough to 

offset the stimulus from the demand shock--and with interest differentials unchanged, 

there would be no pressure on the exchange rate between them to move.9  Of course, if 

there are other economies in the rest of the world that do not experience the same shock, 

the choice of normalization strategy does matter, similar to the analysis of spillovers from 

                                                 
8 See Brainard (2015a).  A number of recent studies have considered financial spillovers to EMEs, 
including Rey (2014) and Bowman, Londono, and Sapriza (2015).  The analysis of Hofmann, Shim, and 
Shin (2016) suggests that EMEs may be hurt more if their banks or nonfinancial corporations have 
relatively large dollar liabilities, as the larger dollar appreciation associated with the policy rate tool would 
precipitate greater EME balance sheet deterioration in this case. 
9 In this simple example, in which the two countries are hit by identical shocks, the offset in spillovers 
between the two economies will be complete.  If one country faces a larger aggregate demand shock than 
the other, then the situation becomes more like the one-country case we examined before, the policy 
adjustments lead to spillovers of different magnitudes, and the offset will be partial.

the single core country, presumably magnified by the larger combined global weight of 

the two economies. 

Now let’s turn to the case in which the two central banks choose to rely on 

different policy tools. 10  In this case, one country responds to the positive shock by 

hiking its policy rate to reduce output to its initial level, while the second country 

responds by shrinking its balance sheet.  The country that relies on the policy rate to 

make the adjustment experiences an appreciation in the exchange rate, a deterioration in 

net exports and some expansion of domestic demand, while the country that chooses to 

rely solely on the balance sheet for tightening experiences a depreciation of its exchange 

rate and an increase in net exports.  Thus, while both countries achieve their domestic 

stabilization objectives, whether the requisite policy tightening occurs through increases 

in policy rates or reductions in the balance sheet matters for the composition of demand, 

the external balance, and the exchange rate.   

  I highlighted at the outset the commitment adopted by many leading nations to 

set monetary policy to achieve domestic objectives such that the exchange rate would not 

be a primary consideration in the setting of monetary policy.  In the case that balance-

sheet and conventional monetary policies have equivalent effects on both domestic 

spending and the exchange rate, this common principle is straightforward.  But if the 

cross-border spillovers of reductions in the balance sheet and increases in the policy rate 

are not equivalent, the sequencing of policy rate and balance sheet normalization could 

have important implications for the exchange rate and external balance.   

                                                 
10 This simulation is shown in figure 2 in the appendix.

Finally, in circumstances where a major central bank is continuing to expand its 

balance sheet or maintaining a large balance sheet over a sustained period, this policy 

would likely exert downward pressure on term premiums around the globe, especially in 

those foreign economies whose bonds were perceived as close substitutes.  Indeed, until 

very recently, it had been notable how little long yields moved up in the United States 

even as discussions of balance sheet normalization have moved to the forefront.  This 

likely reflects at least in part the expectation that ongoing asset purchase programs in 

other advanced economies would continue holding down long-term yields globally.  The 

tide seems to have turned in recent weeks, as long yields in the U.S. have increased 

notably on market perceptions that foreign officials are beginning to deliberate their own 

normalization strategies.   

I have used a simple stylized model to illustrate circumstances in which the 

choice of normalization strategies adopted by major central banks can potentially be quite 

consequential.  If anything, the analysis presented here serves to highlight the importance 

of research assessing this question from both an empirical and theoretical perspective.      

Let me conclude by returning to the policy choices facing central banks.  The 

Federal Reserve chose to remove accommodation initially through increases in the 

federal funds rate.  In light of recent policy moves, I consider normalization of the federal 

funds rate to be well under way.  If the data continue to confirm a strong labor market 

and firming economic activity, I believe it would be appropriate relatively soon to 

commence the gradual and predictable process of allowing the balance sheet to run off.   

Once that process begins, I will want to assess the inflation process closely before 

making a determination on further adjustments to the federal funds rate in light of the 


 - 11 - 

recent softness in core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation.  In my view, 

the neutral level of the federal funds rate is likely to remain close to zero in real terms 

over the medium term.  If that is the case, we would not have much more additional work 

to do on moving to a neutral stance.  I will want to monitor inflation developments 

carefully, and to move cautiously on further increases in the federal funds rate, so as to 

help guide inflation back up around our symmetric target. 

Meanwhile, in recent days, we have begun to hear acknowledgement from other 

major central banks that they too are seeing conditions that suggest policy normalization 

could be on the table before too long, against the backdrop of a brighter global outlook.  

As I just discussed, the pace and timing of how central banks around the world proceed 

with normalization, and the importance of balance sheet policy relative to changes in 

short term rates in these normalization plans, could have important implications for 

exchange rates and financial conditions globally.

Appendix:  Description of Stylized Model and Simulation Results 
 
 

A.  Model Description 

The model is a stylized open economy model that includes two symmetric 

countries linked through trade flows.  The model is specified in real terms under the 

implicit assumption that inflation is constant (so that real and nominal variables move by 

the same amount).  Moreover, the model abstracts from any financial linkages between 

the two economies, including the possibility that monetary policy actions in one country 

could directly affect yields in the other (e.g., through portfolio balance channels), though 

such effects are clearly important empirically.    

The two countries include a “Home” (H) county and a “Foreign” (F) country of 

equal size.  Variables in the foreign country are denoted with an asterisk.  In each 

country, the national accounting identity specifies that output, y, is equal to the sum of 

absorption d and net exports nx, that is: 

,
,

nxdy
nxdy
−=

+=
∗∗


where the second equation incorporates the global resource constraint that nx + nx* = 0.  

Here output (y) and absorption (d) are expressed in percent deviation from their 

respective steady states, while net exports are expressed as share of output, and are equal 

to zero in the steady state (that is, prior to any shocks).

Home and foreign absorption depend on long–term interest rates according to the 

following expressions: 

( )
( ) ,

Here rc is the component of long–term interest rates that is driven by 

conventional monetary policy, ru is the component of long–term interest rates that is 

driven by unconventional monetary policy, and u is an exogenous aggregate demand 

shock (with autocorrelation given by ρ).  These interest rate components are assumed to 

have identical effects on aggregate demand, with the parameter σ determining the 

sensitivity of aggregate demand to either component (n..b., interest rates are expressed in 

percentage points deviation from the steady state). 

Net exports are assumed to fall if the real exchange rate (e) rises/appreciates, and 

also if domestic demand is higher relative to foreign demand (since this boost imports).  

Thus: 

( )∗−−−= ddenx αη  

where η is the elasticity of net exports with respect to the exchange rate, and α is the 

elasticity of net exports to the differential between home and foreign absorption.  The real 

exchange rate is expressed in percent deviation from the steady state. 

The exchange rate is determined according to an interest rate parity condition 

which implies that the exchange rate appreciates when domestic interest rates are higher

than foreign interest rates, with elasticities ( φc and φu ) that can differ depending on 

whether interest rate movements are driven by conventional or unconventional policy: 

( ) ( ).∗∗ −+−= rururcrce uc φφ  

The model is closed by specifying the behavior of the monetary authority.  We 

assume that the monetary authority can adjust either the interest rate associated with 

conventional policy (rc), or the interest rate linked to balance sheet actions (ru), or both, 

to affect output (its goal variable).  The conventional feedback rule is thus:

The system above contains 10 equations in 10 endogenous variables (y, y*, d, d*, 

nx, e, rc, rc*, ru, ru*), as well two shocks, u and u*, that can move GDP, its components, 

exchange rates 

B.  Simulation Results 

Figures 1 and 2 show the results of simulating the model under alternative 

assumptions about the shocks and monetary policy reaction.  In each case, the economy 

starts in steady state with all variables at zero and experiences a demand shock in period 

1 that dies out with an autocorrelation ρ of 0.95.  All parameter values are reported in 

Table 1.

Figure 1.  Home Demand Shock 
Figure 1 illustrates the case of a favorable demand shock in the home country. 

The solid lines illustrate the case when Home uses the short-term interest rate as its active 

policy tool, and keeps its balance sheet on hold, consistent with a desire to delay balance 

sheet normalization.   

The policy reaction is calibrated to be sufficiently aggressive that home GDP 

always remains at baseline (see column 2 of Table 1).  The higher policy rate path (that 

is, higher rc) causes the long-term interest rate (panel A) to rise, which in turn induces the 

real exchange rate to appreciate (panel B).  The stronger currency and an expansion in 

domestic absorption (panel C) causes a deterioration in net exports (panel D).  At the end 

of the period shown, domestic demand has nearly returned to baseline, while net exports 

are just a bit below baseline--consistent with Home country’s GDP remaining at baseline 

(panel E).  Because foreign monetary policy rates is assumed to remain on hold, foreign 

GDP (panel F) rises by the improvement in its net exports (that is, by the mirror image of 

panel D, given that foreign domestic absorption is unchanged).  

The dashed lines illustrate the case of a favorable demand shock in the Home 

country when the central bank opts to tighten exclusively through reducing its balance 

sheet (again, by enough to keep output at potential--see column 3 of Table 1).  Long-term 

interest rates (panel A) rise in response, but the exchange rate appreciates less in this case 

(panel B), reflecting the lower assumed sensitivity of the exchange rate to unconventional 

monetary policy actions (φu < φc ).  Net exports decline (panel D) by less--reflecting both 

the smaller exchange rate appreciation and a smaller rise in absorption (panel C)--which 

translates into less of a boost to foreign GDP (panel F) than when the home country 

adjusts through conventional policy. 


 - 16 - 

Figure 2.  Common Demand Shock, Asymmetric Policy Tightening across Countries 

Figure 2 shows a simulation in which the demand shock is assumed to be 

common across countries ( u = u* ).  The home country is assumed to pursue a policy of 

actively adjusting its policy rate, while the foreign Country is assumed to rely exclusively 

on normalizing through the balance sheet.  In each case, the central banks of the two 

countries tighten policy aggressively enough to keep output at potential (see the 

parameter settings in column 4 of Table 1). 

As policy rates rise in the home country (panel A) and the exchange rate is more 

sensitive to policy rates than to the balance sheet, the home country's exchange rate 

(panel B) appreciates, while its net exports (panel D) decline.  Although GDP remains at 

baseline in each country (panels E and F) given our assumption that monetary policy 

keeps output at potential (which is unchanged), the alternative policy normalization 

choices clearly have important effects--even under a common shock--on both exchange 

rates and the composition of demand in each country.  In particular, because exchange 

rates in the foreign country are less sensitive to balance sheet than to interest rate policy, 

the foreign central bank must enact a relatively larger interest rate tightening in order to 

keep its GDP at potential.
