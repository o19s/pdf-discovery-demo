Innovation in digital finance, loosely referred to as fintech, is capturing 

imaginations from Silicon Valley to Chicago to Wall Street.  We’re seeing a steady 

stream of announcements of new startups and partnerships, and consumers are 

downloading fintech apps at an even faster pace.  

Financial products, services, and transactions lend themselves to successive 

waves of technological disruption because they can readily be represented as streams of 

numerical information ripe for digitization.  However, as technological tools used by the 

industry change over time, it is important to keep sight of their impact on the public, 

whether it be on families seeking to own their own home, seniors seeking financial 

security, young adults seeking to invest in education and training, or small businesses 

attempting to smooth through volatile revenues and expenses.   

Current developments in the digitization of finance are important and deserving of 

serious and sustained engagement on the part of policymakers and regulators.  The 

Federal Reserve Board has established a multi-disciplinary working group that is engaged 

in a 360-degree analysis of fintech innovation.  We are bringing together the best 

thinking across the Federal Reserve System, spanning key areas of responsibility, from 

supervision to community development, from financial stability to payments.  As 

policymakers, we want to facilitate innovation where it has the potential to yield public 

benefit, while ensuring that risks are thoroughly understood and managed.  That 

orientation may have different implications in the arena of consumer and small business 

finance, for instance, as compared with payment, clearing, and settlement in the 

wholesale financial markets. 1

Technological and Organizational Changes in Payment, Clearing, and Settlement  

Today, I will focus on newly emerging distributed ledger technologies and related 

protocols, which were inspired originally by Bitcoin, and their potentially important 

applications to payment, clearing, and settlement in the wholesale markets. 

Successive waves of technological advance have swept through payment, 

clearing, and settlement over the past two centuries.  In the 19th century, railroads and the 

telegraph helped improve speed and logistics.  In the second half of the 20th century, 

computers were introduced to deal with the clearing of overwhelming volumes of paper 

checks and stock certificates stimulated by post-war growth.  Starting at about the same 

time and continuing through today, new electronic networks have been established to 

allow high-speed computerized financial communication.  As automation has evolved, 

payment, clearing, and settlement systems have been developed for conducting and 

processing transactions within and between firms.  However, many of these systems have 

historically operated in silos, which can be hard to streamline or replace.  In some areas, 

business processes may still rely heavily on manual or semi-automated procedures. 

 Over time, banks and other firms have organized various types of clearinghouses 

to coordinate clearing and settlement activities in order to reduce costs and risks.  The 

adoption of multilateral clearing in the United States was a key organizational innovation 

that began with the founding of the New York Clearing House in the 1850s.  This led to 

notable efficiencies and risk reduction in the clearing of checks.  Multilateral clearing 

was also used early on to improve clearing in the securities and derivatives markets.  By 

the 1970s, the United States turned to technologies based on the centralized custody and 

clearing of book-entry securities in order to respond to the paperwork crisis in the 


 - 3 - 

equities markets.  Following the recent financial crisis, the United States--along with 

many other countries--expanded the scope of central clearing to help address problems in 

the bilateral clearing of derivatives contracts.   

Today, the possible development and application of distributed ledger technology 

has raised questions about potentially far reaching changes to multilateral clearinghouses 

and the roles of financial institutions as intermediaries in trading, clearing, and settlement 

for their clients.  In the extreme, distributed ledger technologies are seen as enabling a 

much larger universe of  financial actors to transact directly with other financial actors 

and to exchange assets versus funds (that is, to “clear” and settle the underlying 

transactions) virtually instantaneously without the help of intermediaries both within and 

across borders.  This dramatic reduction in frictions would be facilitated by distributed 

ledgers shared across various networks of financial actors that would keep a complete 

and accurate record of all transactions, and meet appropriate goals for transparency, 

privacy, and security.   

At this stage, such a sea-change may sound like a remote possibility, particularly 

for the high volume and highly regulated clearing and settlement functions of the 

wholesale financial markets.  But profound disruptions are not unprecedented in this 

arena.  In the early 1960s, the use of computerized book-entry securities systems to 

streamline custody, clearing, and settlement in the securities markets may have seemed 

like a technologist’s pipe dream.  But these technologies became an important part of 

industry-wide changes in the 1970s.  Today we rely on these types of systems for the 

daily operation of the markets.   


 - 4 - 

Given this backdrop, it is important to give promising technologies the serious 

consideration they merit, seek to understand their opportunities and risks, and actively 

engage in dialogue about their potential uses and evolution.  At the Federal Reserve, we 

approach these issues from the perspective of policymakers safeguarding the public 

interest in safe and sound core banking institutions, financial stability, particularly as it 

pertains to the wholesale financial markets, and the security and efficiency of the 

payment system.   

Distributed ledger technology was introduced for the transfer and record-keeping 

of Bitcoin and other digital currencies.  The essential advantage of the technology is that 

it provides a credible way to transfer an asset without the need for trust in intermediaries 

or counterparties, much like a physical cash transaction.  To do that, a transfer process 

must be able to credibly confirm that a sender of an asset is the owner and has enough of 

the asset to make the transfer to the receiver.  This requires a secure system or protocol to 

transfer assets (the rails), protection against assets being transferred twice (the so-called 

double spend problem), and an immutable record of asset ownership that can be 

automatically and securely updated (the ledger).  The tokenization of digital assets can 

facilitate the transfer process. 

The genuinely innovative aspect of the technology combines a number of 

different core elements that support the transfer process and recordkeeping:    

o Peer-to-peer networking and distributed data storage provide multiple copies 

of a single ledger across participants in the system so that all participants have 

a shared history of all transactions in the system. 


 - 5 - 

o Cryptography, in the form of hashes and digital signatures, provides a secure 

way to initiate a transaction that helps verify ownership and the availability of 

the asset for transfer.  

o Consensus algorithms provide a process for transactions to be confirmed and 

added to the single ledger. 

While Bitcoin was originally associated with the concept of a universally available, 

publicly shared digital ledger technology without any central authority, many of the use 

cases that are currently under development and discussion rely on “permissioned” ledgers 

in which only permitted, known participants can validate transactions.  These in turn can 

be either public or private in terms of access to the ledger.   

The resulting Internet of Value holds out the promise of addressing important 

frictions and reducing intermediation steps in the clearing and settlement process.  For 

example, in cross-border payments, faster processing and reduced costs relative to current 

correspondent banking are cited as specific potential benefits.  Reducing intermediation 

steps in cross-border payments may help reduce costs and counterparty risks and may 

additionally improve financial transparency.    

In securities clearing and settlement, the potential shift to one master record 

shared among participants has some appeal.  Having one immutable record may have the 

potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for reconciliation by avoiding duplicative 

records that have different details related to a transaction that is being cleared and settled.  

This also can lead to greater transparency, reduced costs, and faster securities settlement.  

Likewise, digital ledgers may improve collateral management by improving the tracking 

of ownership and transactions. 


 - 6 - 

For derivatives, there is interest in the potential for digital ledger protocols to 

enable self-execution and possibly self-enforcement of contractual clauses, in the context 

of “smart contracts.”  

As we engage with industry and stakeholders to assess the potential applications 

of digital ledger and related technologies in the payment, clearing, and settlement arena, 

we will be guided by the principles of efficiency, safety and integrity, and financial 

stability. 

Efficiency  

Many are excited about the potential for these new technologies to reduce costs 

and frictions, such as those associated with collateral management and custodial services, 

reduce settlement risk, enhance security, increase transparency, and offer new services.  

But there are also concerns about the costs and risks from the early adoption of rapidly 

evolving and uncertain technologies and technological hurdles in integrating new 

technologies into legacy systems and achieving interoperability across different ledgers 

and networks.  There are questions about the need for substantial new investments to 

obtain capabilities like real-time processing where these capabilities already exist at some 

of the industry’s core infrastructures.  There are also cautions that realizing the full 

potential of distributed ledger technologies could take many years. 

Much of the case for adopting distributed ledger technologies revolves around 

achieving greater efficiency and reducing time and risks to post-trade clearing and 

settlement.  But first, important technological challenges will need to be addressed to 

permit widespread adoption and migration away from legacy systems and networks.  

These include the need for standardization, the development of protocols that will permit 


 - 7 - 

interoperability between other ledgers and networks, and the reduction of computational 

intensity and costs. 

Moreover, distributed ledgers will have to compete with other options and 

priorities of financial firms and clearinghouses in a highly regulated financial ecosystem.  

Thus, a major threshold question for the adoption of distributed ledger technology within 

and between groups of firms engaging in particular types of transactions is whether the 

advantages outweigh the costs of replacing legacy systems.  

In some cases, where distributed ledger technology can be employed internally 

within a firm to automate and speed up business processes, traditional business case 

analysis would presumably lead to efficient technology choices.  By contrast, where 

coordinated industry-level decisions would be needed to develop distributed ledgers 

shared by multiple firms, the case must be compelling for entire networks of market 

participants that will need to make the investments, as well as for the broader public 

interest. 

This set of competing considerations suggests there are likely to be a spectrum of 

cases.  At one end are the high-volume, heavily regulated markets that have made large 

investments in central clearing to provide safe and efficient clearing and settlement for 

the industry and the public.  These markets must always actively consider technological 

and other enhancements to strengthen efficiency and safety.  But as a practical matter, the 

large-scale adoption of wholly new clearing technologies to replace existing legacy 

technologies for major markets may face a significant hurdle initially, such that 

incremental change or delayed adoption until the technology has achieved greater 

maturity and standardization may be more likely. 


 - 8 - 

At the other end of the spectrum, there appear to be some markets or segments 

where clearing practices are relatively cumbersome and outmoded, and the network 

hurdles to the adoption of new technologies are lower.  Improvements in smaller markets 

would also provide an opportunity for market participants to gain operational and 

business experience with distributed ledger technologies that could help inform and 

strengthen the case for broader applications over time. 

A middle case would involve the application of distributed ledger technologies to 

bilateral clearing even where improvements have already been made since the financial 

crisis.  A threshold issue will be the design and safety of new technologies and whether 

firms will want to share a distributed ledger to manage transactions with their different 

counterparties and customers.  No doubt much will depend not only on cost but also on a 

host of business, technical, security, and other issues.  Even so, change might hold 

promise for improving bilateral clearing, and might also help us think about the long-run 

trade-offs between bilateral and central clearing.       

An assessment of the longer-term potential for deployment of distributed ledger 

technology naturally raises questions about whether it might ultimately impact the 

organizational structure for clearing and settlement.  As multilateral clearing 

organizations have strengthened and spread across many of the major asset classes traded 

in the markets, they have enabled coordinated action on governance, rules, technology, 

and risk management.  It is possible that new technologies could substantially change the 

way these functions are pursued, but it would be surprising if they would obviate the need 

for multilateral clearing in the major markets.  Governance, in particular, is a core 

function that is inescapably necessary if multilateral activity, even activity dealing with 


 - 9 - 

distributed ledgers, is to operate effectively.  Indeed, if new technologies could lower the 

costs of multilateral clearing relative to bilateral clearing in new market segments, 

multilateral clearing could even grow. 

    Today’s clearing houses will likely continue to play a central role in highly 

regulated markets and be well positioned to evaluate and implement new clearing 

technologies, while continuing to provide core governance functions in the market.  

Nonetheless, it is also possible that if distributed ledgers ultimately cross asset classes 

and even industries, traditional clearinghouses serving specific market segments might 

have to evolve or new organizations might develop to provide an optimal approach to 

implementation.  Moreover, in principle, the use of distributed ledgers in new market 

segments may call for new clearing arrangements more in tune with new technologies.  

Similarly, organizations that can provide governance or other coordinating functions in 

bilaterally cleared markets may also require organizational structures somewhat different 

from traditional clearinghouses.  We will be following these issues with interest.   

Safety, Integrity, and Financial Stability 

 Safety and integrity in clearing and settlement is a critical, long-standing public 

policy objective of the Federal Reserve, and is critical for broader financial stability.  

Regardless of the technologies employed, if risks to clearing and settlement are not 

identified and addressed, then banks, dealers, and other firms will not be able to manage 

their obligations and market functioning may be impaired.  This is a key reason why 

major clearing and settlement systems are highly regulated.  Hence, the fundamental 

threshold test for new technologies will be whether they can be deployed and operated 

safely, with the requisite high degree of operational and financial integrity, security, and 


 - 10 - 

resilience across a wide range of adverse scenarios.  Regulators and the public need to 

know that if adverse scenarios do occur, there will be robust management and governance 

to respond effectively.   

  Digital ledger technologies will need to be able to address the range of issues 

revolving around the confidentiality and security of firm and client records and data on 

the one hand, as well as law enforcement requirements and issues on the other.  New 

technologies must be robust in practice, not just in theory, to attacks on security, and 

must be able to maintain appropriate confidentiality for records and data.   

In addition, it will be important that digital ledger technologies can meet the 

requirements of law enforcement and other regulators to address money laundering, 

terrorist financing, and other key law enforcement concerns.  Indeed, there is some 

potential that the new technologies could enable improved authorized access to certain 

data records in a much more efficient and comprehensive manner than has previously 

been possible, thereby potentially reducing costs associated with complying with the 

Bank Secrecy Act.      

Overall we should be optimistic that a range of new technologies hold the promise 

of providing more robust security, resilience, and information.  We cannot afford to 

assume that change necessarily equals greater risk.  Of course, much will depend on the 

technology itself, its scalability, its level of maturity, the controls and environment 

surrounding it, the standardization and accessibility of transactions data, the quality of 

management and governance, and the policy environment in which it is deployed.

Key Challenges Going Forward 

 Today, many industry participants are experimenting with distributed ledger 

technology in controlled, permissioned environments.  If some of these experiments bear 

fruit, it will be important to address the challenge of how they would scale and achieve 

diffusion.  In addition, determining exactly how the different distributed ledger 

technologies interoperate with each other, and legacy systems, will be critical.  New and 

highly fragmented “shared systems” may create unintended consequences even as they 

aim to address problems created by today’s siloed operations.  Since distributed ledgers 

often involve shared databases, it will also be important to effectively manage access 

rights as information flows back and forth through shared systems.  There may well be a 

tradeoff between the privacy of trading partners and competitors on the one hand, and the 

ability to leverage shared transactions records for faster and cheaper settlement on the 

other hand.  And of course, development of sound risk-management, resiliency, and 

recovery procedures will be necessary to address operational risks.  The Federal Reserve 

will continue to engage actively with the industry, stakeholders, and our regulatory 

colleagues as the industry works through these challenges and the technology evolves. 

I want to close by remembering a simple point that central bankers and markets 

have learned through hard lessons over many years.  The daily operation of markets and 

their clearing and settlement functions are built on trust and confidence.  Market 

participants trust that clearing and settlement functions and institutions will work 

properly every day.  Confidence has built over time that when market participants trade, 

accurate and timely clearing and settlement will follow.  Any disruption to this 

confidence comes at great cost to market integrity and financial stability.  This is a matter 


 - 12 - 

of fundamental public interest.  In safeguarding the public interest, the first line of inquiry 

and protection will always rest with those closest to the technology innovations and to the 

organizations that consider adopting the technology.  But regulators also should seek to 

analyze the implications of technology developments through constructive and timely 

engagement.  We should be attentive to the potential benefits of these new technologies, 

and prepared to make the necessary regulatory adjustments if their safety and integrity is 

proven and their potential benefits found to be in the public interest.
