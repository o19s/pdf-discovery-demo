before the 

Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations 

of the 

Committee on Financial Services 

U.S. House of Representatives 

Washington, D.C.

Chairman McHenry, Ranking Member Green, and other members of the subcommittee, 

thank you for the opportunity to testify about the Federal Reserve’s supervisory activities 

pertaining to banking organizations and their account relationships with law-abiding businesses.  

In my testimony, I will describe the legal framework governing the establishment and 

maintenance of customer accounts and the regulatory expectations the Federal Reserve has 

established for the banking organizations we supervise.  I will also highlight related aspects of 

our examination and enforcement process in this area.  

Let me begin by saying that the Federal Reserve believes it is important that banking 

organizations provide services to consumers and businesses whose activities comply with 

applicable laws.  It is equally important that the banks we supervise do not facilitate or 

participate in illegal activity.  Indeed, during the past several years the Federal Reserve has 

provided information to the banking organizations we supervise to clarify the requirements for 

providing account services to law-abiding businesses.  

Legal Framework and the Federal Reserve’s Regulatory Expectations 

Congress, through the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), requires banking organizations to 

establish and maintain anti-money-laundering (AML) programs designed to detect when services 

provided by the organization are being used for illegal purposes.  By law, each Federal Reserve-

regulated institution, like other depository institutions, must have a BSA program that contains 

four critical elements, including a system of internal controls to ensure ongoing compliance with 

the BSA, independent testing of the bank’s compliance with the BSA, training of appropriate 

bank personnel, and the designation of an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring 

day-to-day compliance with the BSA.1  Under the general rubric of “know your customer” laws 

1  See 31 U.S.C. § 5318(h) and Board of Governors Regulation H (12 C.F.R. § 208.63) (BSA program requirements 
for state member banks).

and regulations, each banking organization is also required to maintain a customer identification 

program as part of the BSA compliance program and perform due diligence on its customers.2  

In addition, a banking organization must identify and report known or suspected criminal 

violations of the BSA or certain other federal laws and suspicious transactions related to money-

laundering activity.3  Criminal prosecutors at the Department of Justice and other law 

enforcement officials have direct access to the database that holds these Suspicious Activity 

Reports and rely on this information to initiate criminal investigations. 

The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have published an 

examination manual intended to provide practical and flexible guidance to examiners and 

banking organizations regarding acceptable customer due-diligence and risk-mitigation practices 

as part of an effective BSA program.4  The Federal Reserve expects a banking organization to 

maintain adequate policies and procedures to address risks associated with customer 

relationships.  The scope of these policies and procedures will depend on the banking 

organization’s ongoing assessment of the risks posed by the particular customer relationship.  A 

banking organization takes many factors into account when conducting a customer risk 

assessment including, in particular, the standards the customer has in place to ensure compliance 

with applicable laws and regulations, and the relationship the customer seeks with the banking 

organization.  It is essential that banking organizations make a judgment as to customers with 

respect to the level of risk they pose.  

2  See 31 C.F.R. § 103.121 and Board of Governors Regulations H and K at 12 C.F.R. §§ 208.63(b)(2), 211.5(m)(2), 
and 211.24(j)(2) (customer identification requirements). 
3  See 12 C.F.R. § 208.62 and Regulations K and Y at 12 C.F.R. §§ 211.5(k), 211.24(f), and 225.4(f) (suspicious 
activity reporting requirements). 
4  See Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (2010), “Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering 
Examination Manual” (April 29).

The purpose of these policies is to ensure banking organizations provide services to law-

abiding customers.  The decision to establish, limit, or terminate a particular customer 

relationship is a decision for the banking organization.  This decision may be based on various 

factors, including a banking organization’s assessment of the risks associated with offering 

banking services to a particular customer, and its capacity and systems to effectively manage 

those risks.  It is not the Board’s policy to discourage banking organizations from offering 

services to any class of law-abiding financial services consumers or businesses.  

Payment Services Offered by Nonbanks 

Many of the questions that have arisen with respect to the customer due-diligence 

expectations of the federal banking agencies relate to the involvement of nonbanks as 

intermediaries or providers of financial services, including money services businesses (MSBs) 

and third-party payment processors (TPPPs).  MSBs provide financial services, such as check 

cashing, money remittance, and other services, to customers that do not have traditional bank 

accounts.  Some MSBs include large, globally active companies while others are small 

businesses such as gas stations and convenience stores offering financial products and services.  

By comparison, TPPPs are bank customers that provide payment-processing services to 

merchants and other entities such as telemarketers and online businesses.  Both MSBs and 

TPPPs engage in transactions with individuals and companies who are not direct customers of 

the bank.  

The Federal Reserve follows guidance issued in 2005 by the federal banking agencies 

and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) governing account relationships with 


- 4 - 
 
MSBs.5  That guidance confirms that banking organizations may provide banking services to 

MSBs that operate lawfully.  The guidance is intended to assist banks in the decision to open and 

maintain accounts for legitimate businesses by identifying the programs and procedures they 

should have in place to perform customer due diligence and monitoring of these customers for 

suspicious activity.  

The Federal Reserve also follows the interagency examination manual and related 

guidance issued by FinCEN when evaluating the procedures banking organizations use to 

manage account relationships with TPPPs.6  These entities often use their commercial bank 

accounts to conduct payment processing for their merchant clients.  The guidance is designed to 

assist banking organizations in designing and implementing policies and systems for monitoring 

and managing the risks associated with the payment and lending products they offer.  The 

objective of the guidance and the Federal Reserve’s supervisory activities is to direct banking 

organizations to take appropriate steps to offer their services to legitimate and law-abiding 

customers, and to minimize the risk of facilitating money laundering, terrorist financing, or other 

illicit activity.  

Examination and Enforcement Process 

In 1986, Congress included in the Money Laundering Control Act the requirement that 

the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies examine the AML program and 

procedures banking organizations use to assure compliance with the BSA and report problems 

5  See Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision (2005), “Interagency Interpretive Guidance on Providing Banking 
Services to Money Services Businesses Operating in the United States” (April 26).

Third-Party Payment Processors” (October 22).

with a bank’s procedures to management.  Under the Money Laundering Control Act, the federal 

banking agencies are required to take formal, public action against a financial institution that 

fails to establish and maintain the required program or correct problems with the program that 

were previously reported to the institution by the supervisors.  

Consistent with this mandate, the Federal Reserve generally conducts regular on-site 

examinations of each bank it is charged with supervising on an alternating basis with state 

banking supervisors.  As part of these examinations, examiners review the institution’s AML 

procedures and its compliance with the BSA.  For large, complex banking organizations, the 

safety and soundness examination process is continuous, and anti-money-laundering and BSA 

compliance is incorporated into the examination process.  

When we find that a bank has not adopted a program and procedures that properly meet 

the bank’s BSA obligations, the matter is discussed with bank management and noted in the 

institution’s report of examination.  The Federal Reserve’s enforcement actions under the BSA 

typically are aimed at correcting deficiencies in an organization’s policies and procedures for 

monitoring account activities and identifying unlawful or suspicious transactions.  

Recent Justice Department Initiative 

Finally, regarding the focus of this hearing, Operation Choke Point is an initiative of the 

Department of Justice and not an initiative of the Federal Reserve.  The Department of Justice 

has the sole authority to indict or seek criminal fines or other sanctions and to criminally 

prosecute individuals and businesses for their actions.  As we have testified previously, the 

Federal Reserve cooperates with other agencies in various enforcement actions, including by

providing information in response to subpoenas issued by the Justice Department or other federal 

law enforcement authorities.7 

Thank you very much for inviting me to present the Federal Reserve’s views on these 

important issues.  I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have.
