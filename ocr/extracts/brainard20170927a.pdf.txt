Labor Market Disparities and Economic Performance 

Remarks by 

Lael Brainard 

Member 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at 

“Banking and the Economy:  A Forum for Minority Bankers,” a conference hosted by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 

Kansas City, Missouri 

September 27, 2017 



I would like to thank President George and her staff at the Federal Reserve Bank 

of Kansas City for inviting me to participate in today’s conference, which is a joint effort 

of the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, 

Richmond, and St. Louis as well as the Federal Reserve Board.1  

Diversity in Financial Services  

As you may know, this is the second minority bankers forum hosted by the 

Federal Reserve System.  Diversity and inclusion are important to the strength of the 

banking industry, and therefore I am pleased that the Federal Reserve System is 

sponsoring this conference.  Among other benefits, diversity and inclusion strengthen 

organizations by improving deliberations and decisionmaking.  Banks with more diverse 

workforces are also better able to reach broader groups of customers, especially 

customers who have historically been underbanked, when they show that serving those 

customers is a top priority.  One of the most effective ways of showing a commitment to 

a diverse customer base is showing a commitment to a diverse workforce. 

We now have substantial empirical evidence documenting the benefits of 

diversity in broadening the range of ideas and perspectives that are brought to bear on 

solving problems, and thereby contributing to better outcomes, in research, policy, and 

business.  Studies suggest that increased diversity alters group dynamics and 

decisionmaking in positive ways.  Microeconomic experiments and other research have 

confirmed these ideas.  One experiment found that greater racial diversity helped groups 

of business students outperform other students in solving problems.  And another found

the Federal Open Market Committee.

similar benefits from gender diversity.  A study of 2.5 million research papers across the 

sciences found that those written by ethnically diverse research teams received more 

citations and had a greater influence than papers by authors with the same ethnicity.2 

As a bank regulator, the Federal Reserve has an interest in promoting diversity in 

the financial services industry.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is 

actively engaged in developing diverse talent in the financial services industry as a key 

partner of the Financial Services Pipeline Initiative (FSP).  The FSP is a collaborative of 

about 20 financial services organizations that are working together to increase the 

representation of Latinos and African Americans, at all levels, within the Chicago-area 

financial services industry. The members of this initiative recognize they have a 

collective interest in developing a diverse pipeline of talent.  They are more likely to be 

more successful in achieving their internal pipeline goals if they succeed in improving 

diversity and inclusion in the finance workforce more broadly.  

Another example of our work to promote diversity at banking institutions is the 

standards developed by the Board’s Office of Minority and Women Inclusion to promote 

transparency and awareness of diversity policies and practices within banking 

institutions.  The Board encourages banking institutions not only to provide their policies, 

practices, and self-assessment information to the Board, but also to disclose this 

information to the public.  We hope that this new self-assessment tool will help 

individual banks achieve their own diversity and inclusion goals and contribute to greater 

diversity in the banking industry more generally.

I also want to take this opportunity to update you on what we are doing to 

preserve and promote Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs).  Though I know that only 

some of you work for MDIs, the Federal Reserve recognizes their vital role in serving 

low- and moderate-income and minority communities as well as bringing diversity to the 

field of banking.  I make a point of meeting with the leadership of MDIs as I travel 

around the country so I can hear firsthand about the challenges these institutions face and 

the important work they are doing to provide financial services to minority and 

historically underserved populations.  I have heard from CEOs of MDIs about how 

challenging it can be to simultaneously serve their target market and be a bank of choice 

in a competitive banking market.  Some have managed to thread that needle successfully 

by remaining firmly rooted and accessible in the communities they serve as well as 

maintaining their focus on trust, loyalty, and personalized relationship banking, which is 

a particular strength and competitive advantage for MDIs. 

The Federal Reserve has developed a national outreach program called the 

Partnership for Progress to assist MDIs in confronting business model challenges, 

cultivating safe banking practices, and competing more efficiently.  Recently, the Board 

doubled its resources for this program to better support MDIs.  We brought to bear the 

resources of our community development function, which promotes economic growth 

and financial stability in lower-income communities.  Combining the resources of our 

banking and supervision staff with our community development staff allows us to be 

more creative in supporting MDIs around the country.  Recognizing that there has been a 

dearth of MDI research in recent decades, last year, for the first time, we commissioned 

two external researchers to develop papers on MDIs.  The resulting new papers, along

with another written by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, were 

presented at the interagency biennial MDI conference this past April in Los Angeles.  We 

are in the process of commissioning research for next year in an effort to deepen our 

understanding of these unique institutions. 

Labor Market Disparities  

Turning to the workforce more broadly, I want to spend some of my time today 

talking about disparities and share some findings from a conference we hosted yesterday 

at the Board titled “Disparities in the Labor Market:  What Are We Missing?”  In 

fulfilling its dual mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has set a target 

of 2 percent for inflation but does not have a similarly fixed numerical goal for maximum 

employment.  That is because the level of maximum employment depends on 

“nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market,” which 

“may change over time and may not be directly measurable.”3  Understanding how close 

the labor market is to our full-employment goal requires consulting a variety of evidence 

along with a healthy dose of judgment.  This approach to maximum employment has 

allowed the FOMC to navigate the current expansion in a way that has likely brought 

more people back into productive employment than might have been the case with a fixed 

unemployment rate target based on pre-crisis standards.  

The Federal Reserve is also keenly interested in disparities in employment, labor 

force participation, income, and wealth because they may have implications for the 

growth capacity of the economy.  When we consider appropriate monetary policy, we 

need to have a good sense of how fast the economy can grow without fueling excessive

website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomc_longerrungoals.pdf.

price inflation.  At a time when the retirement of the baby-boom generation looks likely 

to be something of a drag on the growth of the labor force, it is especially important to 

consider whether relatively low levels of employment and labor force participation for 

some prime working-age groups represent slack that, if successfully tapped, could 

increase the labor force and boost economic activity.  

More broadly, when a person who was previously unemployed or discouraged 

secures a job, not only does it boost the economy, but that person also may gain a greater 

sense of economic security, self-sufficiency, and self-worth and be better able to invest in 

their family’s future.  With a richer understanding of economic or social barriers that 

inhibit labor market success and prosperity for some groups, we may better grasp how 

much these individuals can be helped by broad economic expansion and how much 

targeted intervention is required through other policy means.4   

There is also an important connection between the economy’s potential growth 

rate and equality of opportunity.  Large disparities in opportunity based on race, ethnicity, 

gender, or geography mean that the enterprise, exertion, and investments of households 

and businesses from different groups are not rewarded commensurately.  To the extent 

that disparities in income and wealth across race, ethnicity, gender, or geography reflect 

such disparities in opportunity, families and small businesses from the disadvantaged 

groups will then underinvest in education or business endeavors, and potential growth 

will fall short of the levels it might otherwise attain.5

demographic groups, see Carpenter and Rodgers (2004). 
5 For more on inequality of opportunity see Marrero and Rodriquez (2013).

Aside from reducing the long-run productive potential of the economy, 

persistently high levels of income and wealth inequality may also have implications for 

the robustness of consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of aggregate 

spending in the United States.  The gaps in household income and wealth between the 

richest and poorest households are at historically high levels, as income and wealth have 

increasingly accrued to the very richest households.  For example, results from the 

Federal Reserve’s latest Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), which is due to be released 

soon, indicate that the share of income held by the top 1 percent of households reached 

24 percent in 2015, up from 17 percent in 1988.  The share of wealth held by the top 

1 percent rose to 39 percent in 2016, up from 30 percent in 1989.6  Some research 

suggests that widening income and wealth inequality may damp consumer spending in 

the aggregate, as the wealthiest households are likely to save a much larger proportion of 

any additional income they earn relative to households in lower income groups that are 

likely to spend a higher proportion on goods and services.7   

Disparities by Race and Ethnicity 

 When we disaggregate the economy-wide labor market statistics, we find 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic disparities.8  In August, the national 

unemployment rate of 4.4 percent, which is low by historical standards, masked 

substantial differences across different demographic groups.  As shown in figure 1, 

unemployment rates ranged from 3.9 percent for whites to 4 percent for Asians,

these data, see Bricker and others (forthcoming).

income and wealth inequality and consumer spending.

5.2 percent for Hispanics, and 7.7 percent for African Americans.  Labor force 

participation rates, shown in figure 2, also differ substantially, although by less than 

unemployment rates, with the rate for African Americans lowest at 62.2 percent.  These 

differences are not a recent development--similar differences across racial and ethnic 

dimensions have existed for as long as these data have been collected.  Even more 

striking, a significant portion of the gaps in unemployment rates across racial and ethnic 

groups cannot be attributed to differences in their underlying characteristics, such as age 

and education levels.9   

 Although the differences in employment rates between racial and ethnic groups 

are still quite large, they have narrowed recently, after having widened considerably 

during the recession, and are near their lowest levels in decades.  Differences in 

unemployment rates across racial and ethnic groups tend to widen sharply during 

recessions, as less advantaged groups shoulder an outsized share of total layoffs, and 

these differences shrink during recoveries.  For example, in the second quarter of 2017, 

the unemployment rate for black adult men was a little more than 3 percentage points 

higher than for white adult men.  This differential, while sizable, is nonetheless close to 

the smallest gap seen since comparable data became available in the mid-1970s.  

Differences in unemployment rates are similarly near historical lows for black women 

relative to white women, and for Hispanics relative to whites.  Since racial disparities 

tend to get smaller throughout the course of an economic expansion, it seems likely that 

                                                 
9 See Cajner and others (2017) for more on racial gaps and the labor market.

racial differences in unemployment rates will continue to shrink if the overall 

unemployment rate falls further.10   

More broadly, the persistent disparities in employment outcomes are mirrored in 

significant and persistent racial and ethnic differences in families’ income and wealth.  

According to forthcoming findings from the latest SCF and as shown in figure 3, the 

average income for white families in 2015 was about $123,000 per year, compared with 

$54,000 for black families and $57,000 for Hispanic families.11  Disparities in wealth, 

shown in figure 4, are even larger:  Average wealth holdings for white families in 2016 

were about $933,000, compared with $191,000 for Hispanic families and $138,000 for 

black families.12  Moreover, these racial and ethnic gaps in average family income and 

wealth have generally widened rather than narrowed over the past few decades.  Based on 

SCF data, median family wealth has grown much more rapidly for white families than for 

other families over the past few decades, while median family incomes have risen by 

about the same amount for white, black, and Hispanic families.   

As the economic expansion continues and brings more Americans off the 

sidelines and into productive employment, it seems likely that the positive trends in 

employment and participation rates for historically disadvantaged groups will continue.  

                                                 
10 Data on recent estimates of unemployment rates for adult men (20 years and older) by race and ethnicity 
are available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Historical gaps are provided by Cajner and others 
(2017). 
11 Staff calculations from forthcoming SCF data.  Recent estimates of household income from Current 
Population Survey data and reported by the Census in Semega, Fontenot, and Kollar (2017) are 
qualitatively similar, in that between 2013 and 2016 for both sets of data, family income has increased for 
whites, blacks, and Hispanics (with greater increases, in percentage terms, for black and Hispanic families). 
12 Racial and ethnic differences in median income and wealth are somewhat smaller.  For example, in 2016 
median income for white families was about $61,000, compared with $35,000 for black families and 
$39,000 for Hispanic families.  Median wealth was about $171,000 for white families, compared with 
about $20,000 for black and Hispanic families. The larger gap in average income and wealth than median 
income and wealth reflects a greater concentration of income and wealth among the wealthiest white 
families than for other races and ethnicities.

That said, the benefits of a lengthy recovery can only go so far, as the research points to 

some barriers to labor market outcomes for particular groups that appear to be structural.  

After controlling for sectoral and educational differences, the research suggests that these 

factors include discrimination as well as differences in access to quality education and 

informal social networks that may be an important source of information and support 

regarding employment opportunities.13   

Federal Reserve Work on Labor Market Disparities 

While the policy tools available to the Federal Reserve are not well suited to 

addressing the barriers that contribute to persistent disparities in labor market outcomes, 

understanding these barriers and efforts to address them is vital in assessing maximum 

employment as well as potential growth.  The Federal Reserve is deeply engaged in 

understanding disparities through our data collection, research collaboration, and 

community development work.  One way the Federal Reserve seeks to obtain a clearer 

picture is by collecting data ourselves.  For instance, some of the data I have cited today 

come from the Federal Reserve’s triennial Survey of Consumer Finances, which provides 

detailed information on income and wealth holdings by demographic groups.  The Survey 

of Household Economics and Decisionmaking provides a portrait of household finances, 

employment, housing, and debt; the Survey of Young Workers provides insights into 

younger adults’ employment experiences soon after entering the labor force; and the 

Enterprising and Informal Work Activities Survey provides information about income 

                                                 
13 For example, see Fryer (2011) and Ritter and Taylor (2011).

generating activities that are often outside the scope of other employment and income 

surveys.14   

 Each recent edition of the semiannual Monetary Policy Report (MPR) has focused on 

some aspect of the comparative economic experience of different racial and ethnic groups. In 

addition, as indicated in the minutes published after each meeting of the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC), Federal Reserve staff regularly report on the differential 

labor experiences of different racial and ethnic groups as background for the FOMC’s 

deliberations on monetary policy.   

 Across the Federal Reserve System, a variety of initiatives are aimed at 

understanding economic disparities and how to foster more-inclusive growth.  The 

Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis 

brings together researchers from a variety of fields to analyze barriers to economic 

opportunity and advancement.  The Economic Growth and Mobility Project at the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia aims to bring together researchers with community 

stakeholders to focus on differences in poverty and economic mobility across 

demographic characteristics.  The Investing in America’s Workforce Initiative is a 

collaboration between the Federal Reserve System and academic research institutions to 

promote investment in workforce skills that better align with employers’ needs.15

 In short, a deeper understanding of labor market disparities is central to the 

mission of the Federal Reserve because it may help us better assess full employment, 

where resources may be underutilized, and the likely evolution of the labor market and 

overall economic activity.    Let me conclude by thanking you again for having me here 

today and allowing me the opportunity to explore some of the factors that influence labor 

market disparities.
