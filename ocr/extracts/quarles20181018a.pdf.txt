Thank you for having me.1  I very much appreciate the opportunity to speak to 

this distinguished group and look forward to my discussion with Greg Ip.  Now almost 

exactly a year into my appointment as Vice Chairman for Supervision, I have, as might 

be expected, spoken publicly most often about banking and the financial system more 

generally.  However, supervision and regulation are not all that I do at the Federal 

Reserve, and I welcome this opportunity to speak to another part of my day job, as a 

member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  Today I would like to offer 

my take on the economic outlook, which is optimistic, and explain how I view my 

optimism as consistent with the continued gradual pace of policy tightening that many 

Committee participants have projected.  In particular, I will explain how my views on 

potential growth help shape my outlook, both for the economy and for the appropriate 

path of monetary policy.  Relatedly, I will discuss the uncertainties that arise when a 

central element of the outlook--in this case, the potential capacity of the economy--is 

unknown and largely unobservable.  Such uncertainty can complicate policymaking in 

even what appears to be a very healthy economy, providing a further argument for 

gradualism.   

Where We Are Now 

In previous remarks on the economic outlook, delivered at a National Association 

for Business Economics conference in February, I characterized the U.S. economy as 

being in a “good spot” and asked if the economy had reached a positive turning point

Reserve System.

following an extended period of post-crisis slow growth.  I argued that while it might be 

too soon to call a turning point, there was a definite possibility of an upside surprise.2 

So now that we are fairly deep into 2018, where do we stand overall?  My view 

has not changed all that much from February.  While many other forecasters had to revise 

up their forecasts over the course of the year, my own outlook is basically unchanged, 

because the economy is evolving essentially as I expected at the outset of the year.  The 

economy remains in a good spot.  Gross domestic product increased a robust 

3-1/4 percent in the first half of the year, and indicators suggest continued strong growth 

through the summer.  Economic conditions are as close to meeting the Federal Reserve’s 

dual mandate for monetary policy--maximum sustainable employment and price 

stability--as they have been in a long time.  Inflation is in line with the Committee’s 

2 percent objective, and the unemployment rate is at nearly a 50-year low.      

How long can this strong growth be sustained?  The answer depends largely on 

what form growth takes.  Growth that is supported by increases in the productive capacity 

of the economy should be durable.  However, if growth primarily reflects strong demand 

that stretches production beyond its sustainable capacity, the economy will run into 

constraints that will result in slower growth, higher prices, or a potentially destabilizing 

buildup of financial imbalances.  So, which is it?  Unfortunately, it is very difficult to tell.  

I will return to that question shortly. 

That said, I see many reasons to be optimistic about the growth of the potential 

capacity of the economy over the next few years.  In part, my optimism is rooted in the

view that many of the factors that have been weighing on potential growth since the 

financial crisis could be lifting.  So, have we reached the turning point?  While I believe 

the issue remains unresolved, the recent evidence is encouraging. 

Have We Reached a Turning Point? 

Why am I optimistic about the economy’s supply potential?  The growth of 

potential can, at the most basic level, be broken down into two factors:  the supply of 

labor and the productivity of that labor.  Productivity, in turn, is importantly affected by 

changes in the stock of capital--that is, machines and factories--as well as technological 

advances and improved production methods.  I see reasons to be hopeful about both 

factors. 

Let us start with labor.  For some time, the contribution of the labor force to 

potential growth has been held down by the predictable drag of baby boomers moving 

into retirement.  However, the decline in labor force participation following the financial 

crisis exceeded even what might be expected given this long-standing downward trend-- 

in particular, as the participation of prime-age workers (those between the ages of 25 and 

54) fell and teenagers exited the workforce in droves.  The reasons behind the fall in 

participation among non-retirement-age workers have been the subject of much debate.  

However, I see little reason to assume that it will be permanent, and we have already seen 

some signs of a turnaround.  Thus, I think there is some potential for labor force 

participation to move up, perhaps as workers respond to the incentives of plentiful job 

opportunities and higher wages, thereby adding to the productive capacity of the 

economy and pushing back the constraints on growth.

Some recent labor force trends have been promising.  For example, the two-

decade-long trend increase in the population not in the labor force on account of 

disability peaked in 2014 and has started to move down quite rapidly--again, for reasons 

that defy easy explanation but may reflect the general improvement in labor market 

opportunities.3 

I will now turn to productivity.  Labor productivity has averaged an annual 

growth rate of only 3/4 percent since 2011, far below the 2-1/4 percent pace that 

prevailed in the two decades before the financial crisis.  Although there are competing 

theories, the productivity decline is not well understood, and a consensus explanation has 

yet to emerge.  As such, the slowdown could reverse unpredictably as well.  The most 

recent data have been moving in the right direction, but only haltingly, with labor 

productivity increasing about 1-1/4 percent over the past year.   

There are reasons that productivity growth could shake off some of its recent 

torpidity.  I would like to start with the capital stock.  After a few years of abysmal 

business-sector investment spending, it appears as though the drought has broken.  After 

picking up in 2017, business fixed investment climbed a robust 10 percent at an annual 

rate in the first half of this year, likely supported by lower corporate tax rates and other 

incentives in last year’s tax bill.  Also, indicators for investment, including orders and 

shipments of nondefense capital goods, point toward continued strength, and survey 

evidence points to high business optimism and solid capital expenditure plans.  More 

capital should allow labor to be more productive.

York Times, March 15.

I am also a bit of a techno-enthusiast.  We are in the early stages of a more 

widespread application of a wave of new technologies, such as 5G communications, AI 

(artificial intelligence) and machine learning, and 3-D printing.  It might be that the 

productivity gains associated with these and other new technologies are embodied in new 

capital equipment and will only now start to become apparent as the investment drought 

of recent years comes to an end.  A tighter economy could also create incentives for firms 

to revamp their production methods to save on scarce labor resources. 

To summarize, the economy has been doing very well.  Whether this performance 

is sustained will be importantly determined by whether growth is supported by increases 

in the economy’s potential.  I am hopeful that potential growth, and particularly 

productivity, could accelerate from its relatively anemic pace of late, sustaining growth 

without overheating the economy.  The more the economy’s potential growth increases, 

the more gradual we can be in our removal of monetary policy accommodation.  Thus, an 

assessment of the pace of potential growth will be an important input into what I view as 

the appropriate path of policy to achieve our objectives of maximum sustainable 

employment and price stability.    

The Difficulty in Identifying Potential 

The tricky thing, as I pointed out earlier, is that potential output is unobserved and 

can only be inferred from the behavior of other measured economic indicators.  

Traditionally, as taught in Econ 101, inflation provides a signal on whether the economy 

is operating above or below its potential level.  If inflation moves up in a sustained 

manner, not just because of temporary shocks, then the economy is likely operating 

above its productive capacity, as firms have the leeway to raise prices given the strength 


 - 6 - 

of demand.  Likewise, if inflation moves down persistently, then the economy is likely 

operating with some slack, as firms restrain prices to sell their products in the face of 

weak demand.     

If inflation is the primary indicator of the economy’s position relative to potential, 

how confident can we be in the quality of the signal?  It has been noted--quite frequently, 

I might add--that the relationship between inflation and the tightness of the economy has 

gotten weaker, which is to say that inflation appears to be less affected by movements in 

economic slack or tightness, traditionally measured by the unemployment rate, than in the 

past.  As the role of slack in explaining inflation has diminished, inflation expectations 

have assumed greater importance.  However, it is reasonable to ask, if inflation is, in fact, 

now largely a reflection of inflation expectations, is inflation still a good indicator of the 

cyclical state of the economy?  Or, more directly, can we count on inflation to warn us in 

time if the economy is overheating? 

To be a little controversial, perhaps what we are witnessing with inflation is an 

application of what has been called Goodhart’s law, named after Charles Goodhart, the 

distinguished scholar of central banking at the London School of Economics.4  The law 

can be summarized as the idea that if an indicator becomes a target of policy, that 

indicator loses its value as a gauge of the state of the economy.  Rather, the indicator 

becomes a signal of the public’s belief in the competence and commitment of the 

government agency that is targeting the indicator.   

                                                 
4 For the original formulation of the law, see C.A.E. Goodhart (1975), “Problems of Monetary 
Management:  The U.K. Experience,” in Papers in Monetary Economics, vol. I (Sydney:  Reserve Bank of 
Australia).

Something along these lines could be happening to inflation, especially given the 

important role of expected inflation in the behavior of actual inflation.  Perhaps inflation 

is just sending a signal of people’s trust in the Fed’s ability to meet its inflation objective.  

If so, no complaints here.  That is a good thing.  However, a problem does arise if the Fed 

remains reliant on inflation as our only gauge of the economy’s position relative to its 

potential.  There are risks in pushing the economy into a place it does not want to go if 

we limit ourselves to navigating by what might be a faulty indicator.  Anchored inflation 

expectations might mask the inflation signal coming from an overheated economy for a 

period, but I have no doubt that prices would eventually move up in response to resource 

constraints.  The ultimate price, from the perspective of the dual mandate, would be an 

unanchoring of inflation expectations.   

Of course, I view this more as a risk than my baseline expectation.  As I have 

said, I am optimistic about potential growth, and I expect that even relatively strong 

growth can be met without running into economic constraints.  However, I also think that 

we should pay attention to other indicators of tightness and overheating in addition to 

inflation.  There are other signs of potential besides inflation, including, but not limited 

to, direct measures of labor utilization or indications of shortages and bottlenecks in 

production.     

Policy Considerations 

How should these thoughts affect monetary policy?  I began my remarks by 

noting that there may be reason to think that the productive capacity of our economy 

could be accelerating, which would allow a more gradual withdrawal of accommodation 

without overheating.  But I have noted as well that there may be reason to think that 


 - 8 - 

resource constraints could be more binding than current inflation measures would 

traditionally indicate, which would call for a more athletic response.  Moreover, there is 

today a higher degree of uncertainty about many of these factors--measures of labor 

slack, the relation between labor slack and inflation, the sensitivity of current inflation 

measures to actual resource constraints, and the future growth of productivity, to name a 

few--than there has been for many years.  In such an environment, some have argued that 

this greater uncertainty leaves policymakers without a clear guide and market participants 

without a firm anchor, meaning policy itself could drift--perhaps dangerously.   

I do not think that is the case at all.  Instead, I think this situation reinforces and 

supports the importance of a clear, steady strategy and a gradual, predictable approach to 

the removal of accommodation as we continue to monitor the data.  The analogy I 

frequently use is the old pilot’s adage of “Don’t chase the needles.”  The control panel of 

any airplane has an instrument to guide your course:  a circular gauge with a vertical bar, 

or “needle,” running through the center of it.  If the bar moves sideways to the left, you 

are drifting off course and should change course to the left until the bar comes back into 

the center of the circle; if it moves to the right, you change course to the right.  Today 

these instruments get their inputs from the plane’s GPS (Global Positioning System) and 

are fairly sensitive and accurate, but decades ago, when I was a young man first learning 

to fly in the clouds, they got their information from radio beacons stationed on the ground 

and were quite squirrelly.  The bar could wander from side to side for a while for any of a 

number of reasons--distance from the beacon, the angle you were approaching it from, 

interference from other instruments on the panel, sunspots, or rain--and because of this 

uncertainty, the first rule taught to us as young pilots was, “Don’t chase the needles.”   


 - 9 - 

Precisely because of the uncertainty around the course inputs, the right strategy 

was to set a course based on your knowledge of the destination, winds, and performance 

of your plane; communicate that course clearly to air traffic control so everyone knew 

what you were doing; and then stick to that course steadily even as the course needle 

might waver from side to side across your instrument.  If the needle moved to one side 

substantially and stayed there pretty consistently, then you would make a small, firm 

correction--but even then, only gradually and with clear communication about what you 

were doing.  In a world where you had great confidence in the sensitivity of your 

instrument, such as in today’s GPS-based avionics, you could respond immediately to 

moment-to-moment changes in your course readings, but in the world of radio beacons 

and sunspots, “chasing the needles” would at best lead to inefficient fishtailing across the 

sky, and at worst to a substantial deviation from your destination. 

Today uncertainty around many of the macroeconomic inputs to monetary policy 

decisions argues for just the same approach to navigation.  Rather than meaning that 

policy will drift because of this uncertainty, it means that policymakers should chart a 

course that is stable, gradual, and predictable; communicate it clearly; and then follow 

that course through the temporarily shifting and sometimes conflicting signs from the 

economy unless some strong and steady signal requires a firm but moderate correction.  

Given that the economy has performed fundamentally as I expected at the outset of this 

year, the right strategy is to maintain the gradual course that I have thought appropriate 

for some time now.  Put another way, while I think that there is enough reason to think 

that the productive capacity of our economy might be increasing so that we should not 

feel compelled to accelerate our pace, I also think there is enough doubt about current 


 - 10 - 

inflation as an infallibly reliable measure of current resource constraints that the 

continued gradual removal of accommodation is appropriate.  Like pilots back in the days 

of radio beacons, don’t chase the needles.
