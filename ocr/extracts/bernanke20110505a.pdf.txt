 The recent financial crisis revealed critical gaps and weaknesses in the U.S. 

financial system and the financial regulatory framework.  The Congress and the 

Administration last year provided a roadmap for addressing many of these problems, in 

the form of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-

Frank Act)--the topic of this year’s conference. 

Legislative reforms in any complex area always face the risk of fighting the last 

war, responding to the causes of the last crisis without sufficient attention to where new 

problems may arise.  To their credit, the authors of the Dodd-Frank Act attempted to 

reduce this risk by building in a number of features aimed at helping our system of 

financial oversight adapt over time to changes in the financial environment.  Notably, a 

central element of the legislation is the requirement that the Federal Reserve and other 

financial regulatory agencies adopt a so-called macroprudential approach--that is, an 

approach that supplements traditional supervision and regulation of individual firms or 

markets with explicit consideration of threats to the stability of the financial system as a 

whole.  The act also created a new Financial Stability Oversight Council, whose 

membership comprises a diverse group of federal and state financial regulators, to 

coordinate the government’s efforts to identify and respond to systemic risks. 

The explicit incorporation of macroprudential considerations in the nation’s 

framework for financial oversight represents a major innovation in our thinking about 

financial regulation, one that is taking hold abroad as well as in the United States.  This 

new direction is constructive and necessary, I believe, but it also poses considerable 

conceptual and operational challenges in its implementation.  In my remarks today I will 

briefly discuss the rationale for macroprudential supervision and regulation, describe the 


 - 2 -

new structure of macroprudential supervision and regulation in the United States, and 

explain how we at the Fed are doing our part to implement the macroprudential approach 

to financial oversight.  

Macroprudential Supervision and Regulation 

Ultimately, the goal of macroprudential supervision and regulation is to minimize 

the risk of financial disruptions that are sufficiently severe to inflict significant damage 

on the broader economy.  The systemic orientation of the macroprudential approach may 

be contrasted with that of the traditional, or “microprudential,” approach to regulation 

and supervision, which is concerned primarily with the safety and soundness of 

individual institutions, markets, or infrastructures. 

Relative to traditional regulation and supervision, executing a macroprudential 

approach to oversight can involve heavier informational requirements and more-complex 

analytic frameworks.  In particular, because of the highly interconnected nature of our 

financial system, macroprudential oversight must be concerned with all major segments 

of the financial sector, including financial institutions, markets, and infrastructures; it 

must also place particular emphasis on understanding the complex linkages and 

interdependencies among institutions and markets, as these linkages determine how 

instability may be propagated throughout the system.  Moreover, broadly speaking, 

macroprudential regulators must be concerned with at least two types of risks.  The first 

type encompasses aspects of the structure of the financial system--such as gaps in 

regulatory coverage or the evolution of shadow banking--that pose ongoing risks to 

financial stability.  The second class of risks are those that vary over time with financial 


 - 3 -

or economic circumstances, such as widespread buildups of leverage in good times that 

could ultimately unwind in destabilizing ways.  

To be sure, a macroprudential approach to oversight does not avoid the need for 

careful microprudential regulation and supervision.  The oversight of individual 

institutions serves many purposes beyond the enhancement of systemic stability, 

including the protection of the deposit insurance fund, the detection of money laundering 

and other forms of financial crime, and the prevention of unlawful discrimination or 

abusive lending practices.  Equally important, however, is that microprudential oversight 

also provides the knowledge base on which a more systemic approach must be built; we 

cannot understand what is going on in the system as a whole without a clear view of 

developments within key firms and markets.  Without a strong microprudential 

framework to underpin them, macroprudential policies would be ineffective. 

That said, a key lesson of the crisis is that a purely microprudential approach, 

focused on the conditions of individual firms or markets, may fail to detect important 

systemic or cross-cutting risks.  For example, a traditional microprudential examination 

might find that an individual financial institution is relying heavily on short-term 

wholesale funding, which may or may not induce a supervisory response.  The 

implications of that finding for the stability of the broader system, however, cannot be 

determined without knowing what is happening outside that particular firm.  Are other, 

similar financial firms also highly reliant on short-term funding?  If so, are the sources of 

short-term funding heavily concentrated?  Is the market for short-term funding likely to 

be stable in a period of high uncertainty, or is it vulnerable to runs?  If short-term funding 

were suddenly to become unavailable, how would the borrowing firms react--for 


 - 4 -

example, would they be forced into a fire sale of assets, which itself could be 

destabilizing, or would they cease to provide funding or critical services for other 

financial actors?  Finally, what implications would these developments have for the 

broader economy?  The analysis of risks from a systemic perspective, not just from the 

perspective of an individual firm, is the hallmark of macroprudential regulation and 

supervision.  And the remedies that might emerge from such an analysis could well be 

more far-reaching and more structural in nature than simply requiring a few firms to 

modify their funding patterns. 

Implementing the Macroprudential Approach in the United States 

Let me be more concrete and talk about the implementation of the 

macroprudential approach in the context of the evolving U.S. regulatory system. 

The first required element of macroprudential oversight is a system for 

monitoring evolving risks to financial stability.  Beyond assigning individual regulatory 

agencies this responsibility, the Dodd-Frank Act took the additional step of setting up a 

new body, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, as I mentioned earlier.  The council 

is charged with monitoring the U.S. financial system, identifying risks that threaten the 

stability of that system, and promoting market discipline and other conditions that 

mitigate excessive risk-taking in financial markets.  The council is made up of 10 voting 

members--including the Federal Reserve--and 5 nonvoting members, who serve in an 

advisory capacity.1    

                                                 
1 The Secretary of the Treasury serves as the chairman of the Financial Stability Oversight Council. Other 
voting members include the heads of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the National Credit Union Administration, the Bureau 
of Consumer Financial Protection, and an independent insurance expert appointed by the President. The 
latter two seats are not yet filled.

The regulatory agencies represented on the council oversee a wide range of 

participants in the U.S. financial system.  The broad membership of the council is 

intended to limit the tendency of regulators to focus narrowly on the institutions and 

markets within their jurisdictions while overlooking risks from interdependencies that cut 

across jurisdictions.  The council also facilitates coordination and information sharing 

among member agencies.  By breaking down the silos that in the past sometimes 

discouraged agencies from looking beyond their specific responsibilities, the council 

should help identify and eliminate gaps and weaknesses within the regulatory structure.   

The Dodd-Frank Act also established--within the Treasury Department--the 

Office of Financial Research, which is responsible for improving the quality of financial 

data available to policymakers.  The oversight council may direct the research office to 

collect information from certain individual financial companies to assess risks to the 

financial system.  This collection and analysis of financial-sector data should allow 

regulators to see more of the financial landscape and better equip them to identify 

systemic risks and other emerging threats.   

To digress for a moment, it’s interesting that the United States isn’t the only 

jurisdiction that has recently created a new institutional structure to implement 

macroprudential policies.  Notably, the European Union (EU) established the European 

Systemic Risk Board, which is responsible for the macroprudential oversight of the EU’s 

financial system.  The board will collect and analyze information on the EU’s financial 

system, identify and prioritize systemic risks, and issue warnings and recommendations 

to national and European authorities.  It will also work closely with the three newly 

created European Supervisory Authorities, which in turn are charged with coordinating 


 - 6 -

prudential regulations for banking, insurance, and securities among EU member states.2  

In the United Kingdom, the government plans to move its microprudential regulatory 

authority back into the Bank of England and create a new Financial Policy Committee to 

implement macroprudential policies.  (Former Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman 

Donald Kohn has been tapped to serve on the Financial Policy Committee, which must 

make him one of the few people to have served as a top financial regulator in two 

different countries.)  The U.K. committee is expected to identify and monitor systemic 

risks and take actions to remove or reduce them.  And it will operate a new resolution 

regime for failing financial firms.  

 The monitoring efforts of the Financial Stability Oversight Council in the United 

States are already well under way.  Staff members from the member agencies have 

established working groups with responsibility for specific sectors or aspects of the 

financial system and are making regular presentations to the council.  This work will also 

be reflected in the council’s required annual report to the Congress on financial stability, 

which is expected to be released in the summer. 

 Of course, the identification of threats to financial stability must be followed by 

appropriate remedies.  The powers of the council itself are relatively limited in this 

regard, at least under most circumstances.  Perhaps its most important responsibility is 

the designation of certain nonbank financial firms and financial market utilities as 

systemically important and thereby subject to additional regulation and oversight by the 

Federal Reserve and other member agencies, including the Commodity Futures Trading 

Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  To make those 

                                                 
2 The three authorities are the European Securities and Markets Authority, the European Banking 
Authority, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. 


 - 7 -

designations, the council will need to determine criteria for identifying firms whose 

financial distress would impose the greatest risks to financial stability.  Of course, this 

task requires continued development of an analytical framework for understanding 

systemic risk and its sources. 

Although the council’s own powers are circumscribed to some degree, the 

potential benefits of its ability to foster cooperative work among U.S. regulatory agencies 

should not be underestimated.  To cite just one example, the stability of money market 

mutual funds--which suffered dramatic runs that worsened funding conditions at the 

height of the crisis--is clearly a systemic issue, not just an industry issue.  The SEC, 

which has already issued rules to increase the stability of money market mutual funds, is 

appropriately taking the lead in investigating whether further steps are necessary.  Under 

the aegis of the council, however, the SEC has consulted with other agencies, including 

the Federal Reserve, which have provided their own analyses and perspectives.  In 

particular, interagency consultation has helped clarify the potential systemic implications 

of instability in the money market mutual fund industry.  The Federal Reserve will be 

among the agencies participating in a roundtable on money fund regulation sponsored by 

the SEC later this month. 

Understandably, given the damage wrought by the crisis, the council and its 

members remain focused on addressing possible sources of financial instability, including 

both structural problems and risks arising from ongoing economic or financial 

developments.  However, no one’s interests are served by the imposition of ineffective or 

burdensome rules that lead to excessive increases in costs or unnecessary restrictions in 

the supply of credit.  Increased coordination and cooperation among regulators, under the 


 - 8 -

auspices of the council where appropriate, should serve not only to improve our 

management of systemic risk, but also reduce the extent of duplicative, inconsistent, or 

ineffective rulemakings.  More generally, in evaluating alternative approaches to 

mitigating systemic risks, regulators must aim to avoid stifling reasonable risk-taking and 

innovation in financial markets, as these factors play an important role in fostering 

broader productivity gains, economic growth, and job creation.  

Macroprudential Policy at the Federal Reserve 

As I have mentioned, besides creating new institutions like the Financial Stability 

Oversight Council, the Dodd-Frank Act has also imposed a macroprudential mandate on 

individual agencies, including the Federal Reserve.  This mandate comes, in some cases, 

with changes in the powers and responsibilities of key agencies.  In the case of the 

Federal Reserve, in addition to membership on the Financial Stability Oversight Council, 

our new responsibilities include the supervision of thrift holding companies as well as 

oversight of nonbank financial firms and certain payment, clearing, and settlement 

utilities that the council designates as systemically important.  In consultation with other 

agencies, we also are responsible for developing more-stringent prudential standards for 

all large banking organizations and for nonbank firms designated by the council as 

systemically important.  These enhanced standards include tougher capital and liquidity 

requirements, the development of resolution plans (so-called living wills), mandatory 

stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve and by the firms themselves, new 

counterparty credit limits, and more-demanding risk-management requirements.  

The Federal Reserve has made and will continue to make significant 

organizational changes as needed to best fulfill our responsibilities.  Even before the 


 - 9 -

enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, we had begun to overhaul our supervision of the 

largest, most-complex financial firms.  An important milestone in this regard was the 

Federal Reserve’s leadership in the spring of 2009 of the Supervisory Capital Assessment 

Program, popularly known as the bank stress test, which comprehensively evaluated the 

health of the largest banking organizations in the country.  We learned valuable lessons 

from that exercise, including an appreciation of the additional insights that can be gained 

by examining a number of major institutions simultaneously, with a focus on comparative 

performance.  Another lesson of the stress test was the value of a multidisciplinary 

approach to supervision, one that combines the skills of economists, financial experts, 

payments systems analysts, and other specialists with those of supervisors and examiners.   

Drawing on this experience, we created a high-level, multidisciplinary working 

group within the Federal Reserve to oversee the supervision of large financial 

institutions.  Under the auspices of this committee--called the Large Institution 

Supervision Coordinating Committee, or LISCC--Federal Reserve supervisors, supported 

by economists and other experts, now routinely use horizontal, or cross-firm, reviews to 

monitor industry practices, common investment or funding strategies, changes in the 

degree or form of financial interconnectedness, or other developments with implications 

for systemic risk.  Supplementing its individual and horizontal reviews, the LISCC has 

also made increasing use of improved quantitative methods for evaluating the health and 

performance of supervised firms as well as the risks they may pose to the broader 

financial system.  A similar committee structure within the Federal Reserve is being 

developed to help us meet our obligations to supervise systemically important financial 

market utilities.   


 - 10 -

To improve our monitoring of the financial system and to coordinate work 

bearing on financial stability, we have also created a new office within the Board, called 

the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research.  This office brings together staff 

with a range of backgrounds and skills and works closely with other groups at the Federal 

Reserve.  The office helps monitor global financial risks and analyze the implications of 

those risks for financial stability; works with our bank supervisory committees, for 

example, on the development of quantitative loss models and alternative scenarios to 

serve as the basis for stress tests; serves as a liaison to the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council and its various working groups; and helps develop and evaluate alternative 

approaches to implementing macroprudential regulations.   

The recent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, in which the Federal 

Reserve evaluated the internal capital planning processes and shareholder distribution 

requests of the 19 largest bank holding companies, is an example of a horizontal 

assessment with a macroprudential approach.  In the wake of the crisis, banks’ capital 

payouts had been kept to a minimum.  As banks’ earnings and capital positions continued 

to improve in 2010, however, some firms sought approval to increase dividends or restart 

share repurchase programs.  The simultaneous assessment of the payout requests in the 

capital review allowed the Federal Reserve, working through the LISCC, to evaluate not 

only the conditions of individual banks but also the potential implications of capital 

payouts for aggregate credit extension and the sustainability of the economic recovery.  

Thus, the program had both microprudential and macroprudential goals.  From a 

traditional safety-and-soundness perspective, we wanted each firm to demonstrate that it 

had robust risk-management systems as well as a capital plan that would allow it to 


 - 11 -

manage potential losses in stress scenarios while comfortably meeting Basel III capital 

requirements as they are phased in.  But, with the help of macroeconomic and capital 

market analysts, we also considered the implications of the requests for the capital 

available to the banking system as a whole, with the objective of ensuring that bank credit 

would still be available to households and businesses even if the economy were to 

perform more poorly than expected. 

We now also routinely apply macroprudential methods to the analysis of 

significant economic developments, whether domestic or foreign.  The sovereign debt 

concerns in Europe provide one example.  As yields on European sovereign debt and 

bank debt rose in the spring of 2010, Federal Reserve supervisors began to evaluate U.S. 

banking firms’ exposures to European banking firms and sovereigns.  In addition to 

evaluating direct exposures, we analyzed scenarios under which sovereign debt concerns 

might lead to broader financial volatility.  Our focus was on the possibility that financial 

disruptions might impede credit flows and economic activity in both Europe and the 

United States.  In our work we conferred extensively with European bank supervisors; for 

example, we discussed potential risks to European banks’ abilities to obtain dollar 

funding and the implications of European banks’ need for dollars on U.S. money markets.  

This work suggested that providing a backstop for the dollar-funding needs of European 

financial institutions could mitigate the potential for spillovers to the United States from 

European sovereign debt concerns.  In accord with this analysis, in May 2010 the Federal 

Open Market Committee announced that it had authorized dollar liquidity swap lines with 

other central banks in a preemptive move to avert a further deterioration in liquidity 

conditions. 


 - 12 -

Macroprudential considerations have also been important for the Federal 

Reserve’s rulemaking, particularly those rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.  For 

example, with other regulators, we recently proposed rules to set margin requirements for 

over-the-counter derivatives that are not cleared through a central counterparty.  The 

proposed rules reflect not only safety-and-soundness concerns but also macroprudential 

goals; specifically, the rules seek to increase the resiliency of the financial system as a 

whole by reducing the potential for contagion between swap market participants.  Under 

the proposed rules, the most-stringent margin requirements would apply to derivatives 

contracts between swap dealers or other major swaps market participants, as such 

arrangements could otherwise involve a risk of “default chains” in which distress at one 

major firm could cascade through the swap markets.   

As I mentioned earlier, the macroprudential approach to financial regulation is 

gaining increasing adherence internationally.  Along with our efforts to implement 

reforms domestically, the Federal Reserve has for some time been working closely with 

foreign counterparts to help coordinate the reform process at the international level.  The 

objectives of international coordination are of the highest importance.  These goals 

include maintaining a level competitive playing field across countries, minimizing 

opportunities for multinational firms to take advantage of weaker or inconsistent 

regulations in some jurisdictions, establishing consistent and complementary standards, 

and ensuring effective oversight of internationally active firms and markets.  The Group 

of Twenty has devoted considerable attention to financial-sector policies in its meetings 

during the past couple of years.  The Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on 


 - 13 -

Banking Supervision, and other international groups also have undertaken substantial 

work to coordinate macroprudential policies across borders.  

Much of the Federal Reserve’s international effort has involved working with 

other regulatory agencies and central banks to design and implement new prudential 

requirements for internationally active banks.  This work resulted in the adoption of 

more-stringent regulatory capital standards for trading activities and securitization 

exposures in the summer of 2009, as well as the agreement last fall on the major elements 

of the new Basel III framework for globally active banks.  Consistent with the 

macroprudential approach, the Basel III framework requires the largest, most globally 

active banks to hold more, higher-quality capital, reflecting the greater systemic risk 

associated with financial distress at the largest institutions.  

Conclusion 

The financial crisis demonstrated clearly that supervisory and regulatory practices 

must consider overall financial stability as well as the safety and soundness of individual 

firms.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires regulators to mitigate the buildup of financial 

excesses and reduce vulnerabilities, and it created an interagency council to monitor 

financial markets, to identify emerging threats, and to help formulate policies to contain 

those risks.  For our part, the Federal Reserve has restructured its internal operations to 

facilitate a macroprudential approach to supervision and regulation and to monitor 

systemic risks.  We are committed to working closely with the oversight council and 

other agencies to promote financial stability.  While a great deal has been accomplished 

since the act was passed less than a year ago, much work remains to better understand 

sources of systemic risk, to develop improved monitoring tools, and to evaluate and 


 - 14 -

implement policy instruments to reduce macroprudential risks.  These are difficult 

challenges, but if we are to avoid a repeat of the crisis and its economic consequences, 

these challenges must be met.
