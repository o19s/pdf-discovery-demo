I am very pleased to visit today with the students and faculty of the Howard 

University Economics Department.  First, a fact that you know but others may not:  The 

Howard University Economics Department is the only producer of economics Ph.D.’s 

among the nation’s historically black colleges and universities, and it has been teaching 

economics to undergraduates for nearly a century.1 

Speaking as one economist to a group among whom I hope will be many future 

economists, let me start by saying that pursuing a degree in economics can bring many 

rewards.  First, an economics degree provides many possible career paths.  The 

discipline’s logical, structured approach to problem solving is valued in many settings, 

including academia, banking, business, consulting, government, and law.  Economics 

majors typically receive salaries that represent a good return on their educational 

investment.  Second, in addition to career prospects and financial rewards, economics 

offers a means of engaging in many of society’s most pressing issues.  The study of 

economics provides a rigorous, analytic perspective on human behavior.  It commands 

respect and has the ability to influence policies that address important issues.  A degree in 

economics will help you understand and participate in these policy debates, putting you 

in a good position to change the world for the better. 

Next, I would like to discuss two current questions that economists are actively 

debating:  First, why is participation in our nation’s labor force declining?  And, second, 

what can be done to improve economic mobility (the ability to climb the economic

Market Committee.

ladder) for children from all groups and from all areas of the country?  By doing so, I 

hope to illustrate the relevance of economics to important, real-life issues. 

The proportion of adults participating in the labor force--that is, either holding 

jobs or actively searching for employment--has declined substantially over the past 

decade.  The decline has reflected, in part, the severe economic recession.  Millions of 

people lost their jobs, and many of them experienced great difficulty finding new 

employment.  Some of these people became discouraged and stopped looking for work.  

In other words, they dropped out of the labor force.  However, much of the decline in 

labor force participation reflects factors that precede the recession.2  Most significantly, 

our population is aging, and older people participate in the labor market at lower rates 

than younger adults.  In addition, the labor force participation of prime-age males--that is, 

individuals aged 25 through 54--has been declining since the mid-1960s, particularly 

among those with only a high school degree or less education, and has continued to 

decline in the years since the last recession. 

Economists are examining a number of reasons why prime-age males are falling 

out of the labor force.  Here there are differences among economists.  Some economists 

have emphasized the role of public assistance programs, such as disability insurance.  

Some evidence suggests that public assistance income has likely played a role.  Other 

economists have put more emphasis on the effects of the reduction over time in the 

demand for lower-skilled labor.3  Indeed, the wages of high school graduates have fallen

sharply in comparison with the wages of college graduates over the past 40 years.  Many 

economists believe that the decline in demand for lower-skilled workers reflects 

technological changes.4  For instance, the introduction of information technology such as 

desktop computers may have boosted the wages of highly skilled workers by more than 

the wages of workers with fewer skills.  The slump in demand for lower-skilled labor 

likely also reflects the effects of globalization, including competition from goods 

produced and imported from abroad.5 

My second current question concerns economic mobility:  How likely is a child 

from a low-income family to move up to a higher income level as an adult?  Over the past 

few years, economists have made important findings using newly available data.  First, 

economic mobility varies substantially across the United States.  For example, the odds 

of a child from the bottom quintile of the income distribution reaching the top quintile of 

income as an adult are 11 percent here in the Washington, D.C., area but only 4 percent 

in the Charlotte, North Carolina, region.  Second, mobility is significantly lower in areas 

with greater residential segregation in terms of both race and income.  Mobility is also 

lower in areas with greater income inequality, less family stability, and lower-quality 

schools.6  However, we need further study and analysis to understand whether these 

factors cause lower mobility or are merely correlated with it.  Thus, despite the gains in 

                                                 
participation of the less skilled, see David H. Autor and Mark G. Duggan (2003), “The Rise in the 
Disability Rolls and the Decline in Unemployment,” Quarterly Journal of Economics, vol. 118 (February),

our knowledge in recent years, significant gaps remain in our understanding of what 

factors help and hinder economic mobility. 

I will conclude by discussing diversity in the economics profession.  Our 

profession currently is not very diverse, but it needs to be.  Only about one-fourth of 

tenured and tenure-track faculty members in U.S. academic economics departments are 

women, and only around 5 percent are African American or Hispanic.  Yet research 

conducted by economists as well as other social scientists suggests that a diversity of 

perspectives and ideas lead to better decisions and increased productivity.7  In my own 

experience, economic policy decisions are better when informed by a wide range of 

views and experiences.  You all here today are crucial to the future of our profession.   

Indeed, I hope that by obtaining your degrees and working on economic 

problems, you will help change the field of economics itself.  As in many other fields, 

economics undergoes continual redesign by its practitioners.  We need--and by that I 

mean society as a whole needs--a more diverse set of practitioners in economics, 

practitioners who may perceive different questions to be important and different answers 

to be more persuasive.  And so, by joining the profession you can acquire the power to 

change not only the field, but also the broad set of societal institutions that are influenced 

by the work of economists. 

Economists tend to respond to the results of research.  And the research shows the 

importance of diversity in decisionmaking.  As a result, many organizations are working 

very seriously to become more diverse.  At the Federal Reserve Board, these efforts 

include developing connections with the Economics Department here at Howard.  Our

economists have recently served as visiting faculty at Howard or have given guest 

lectures here.  During the past spring semester, Board economists served as mentors to 

Howard master’s degree and Ph.D. students.  This fall, we are offering a class on 

statistical programming methods through the university.  On October 25th, we will host 

an open house with the undergraduate economics association here at Howard for students 

who are interested in learning more about the Federal Reserve.  I encourage you to 

attend.  I would also like to make you aware that the Board offers internships to qualified 

students, including Howard students studying economics.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve 

Board’s Office of Diversity and Inclusion is coordinating an effort to increase the 

diversity of our staff.8  Everyone at the Board with responsibility for recruiting, hiring, 

management, and promotion is involved.  But I want to emphasize that these are steps on 

what will be a long road. 

Finally, Board economists are also working to increase our understanding of the 

diverse economic experiences of different groups in the economy.  For example, staff 

economists have recently been examining the disparities in wealth across families using 

our Survey of Consumer Finances.  Wealth is an important measure of household well-

being; it can be used to start a new business, cover expenses when household income 

unexpectedly falls, and provide an inheritance to children--all factors that influence 

opportunities for economic advancement.  One study finds that factors such as 

educational attainment and inheritances almost entirely explain the gap between the 

wealth of white families and that of Hispanic families.  Although these factors also

explain most of the gap in wealth between white families and black families, a substantial 

portion of this gap cannot be explained by such factors.9  Additional research is required 

to fully explain the difference in wealth across white and African American households.   

Thank you for inviting me to speak to you.  It would be great to see some of you 

who are here today going on to influence the direction of the country on any number of 

issues.  To put it in a nutshell, I firmly believe that a degree in economics will equip you 

for a personally productive and rewarding career, will position you to help make progress 

on some of society’s toughest issues, and will change the field of economics itself. 

Thank you for listening--and may you all both enjoy and succeed in your future 

careers, especially in economics.
