Thank you for this invitation to discuss low interest rates and the financial system.  

The framing of this topic raises the question of whether low interest rates have somehow 

undermined the stability and functioning of the financial system.  I will argue that “low 

for long” interest rates have supported slow but steady progress to full employment and 

stable prices, which has in turn supported financial stability.  Indeed, by many measures 

the U.S. financial system is much stronger than before the crisis.  That said, there are 

difficult tradeoffs to manage.  Over time, low rates can put pressure on the business 

models of financial institutions.  And low rates can lead to excessive leverage and 

broadly unsustainable asset prices--things that we watch carefully for and do not observe 

at this point.  I will begin by focusing briefly on the macroeconomic effects of low 

interest rates.  I will then turn to the condition of the financial system--in particular, its 

interplay with low rates.  As always, the views I express here today are mine alone. 

Highly Accommodative Monetary Policy 

The financial crisis and the Great Recession posed the most significant 

macroeconomic challenges for the United States in a half-century, leaving behind high 

unemployment and below-target inflation and calling for highly accommodative 

monetary policies.  Isolating the effects of these policies is challenging, but studies 

generally show that they lowered rates across the curve and moved other asset prices as 

well.1  It is even more challenging to evaluate their effects on aggregate demand.  Low 

rates and higher asset prices should support household and business spending and 

                                                 
1 Williams (2014) compiles the results from a range of studies estimating the effect of the Federal 
Reserve’s large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs).  While the exact numbers vary and are subject to 
substantial uncertainty, typical estimates of the effect of a representative $600 billion in Treasury LSAPs 
on long-term yields are in the range of 15 to 25 basis points, an effect roughly equivalent to that of three or 
four rate cuts of 25 basis points.

investment through various channels.  But low rates may also perversely induce some 

households to save more in order to meet their targets for retirement.  And low rates have 

clearly not produced a boom in corporate investment, although standard accelerator 

models suggest that investment has largely been consistent with the weak pace of 

economic growth.  Nonetheless, there is good reason to think that low rates have 

provided significant support for demand, and my view is that they have done so.2  As you 

can see in slide 1, we are now close to meeting our dual mandate--a reasonable summary 

statistic for the effects of policy.  While growth has been frustratingly slow, employment 

gains have been solid. This is a reasonably good outcome considering the scope of the 

crisis and the relatively poorer performance of other major advanced economies.   

Other Factors Are Holding Down Rates 

There are also many factors other than monetary policy that are holding down 

long-term interest rates.  Long-term nominal and real rates have been declining for over 

30 years.  The next slide decomposes long-term nominal yields into expected future 

short-term real rates, expected future inflation, and a term premium.  These estimates are 

based on one of the Board’s workhorse term structure models.3  All three components 

have contributed to the downward trend in long-term nominal yields.   

The downward trend in nominal term premiums likely reflects both lower 

inflation risk and the fact that, with inflation expectations anchored, nominal bonds have 

become an increasingly good hedge against market risk.  That has made bonds a more 

                                                 
2 See Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015).  The most interest rate sensitive sectors of the economy, 
such as consumer durables and residential investment, have exhibited higher growth than other sectors 
since the second round of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve.  And, for example, Mian, Rao, and 
Sufi (2013) conclude that the decline in house prices during the recession had a substantial effect on 
consumption; by the same argument, if low rates supported house prices, then they would have supported 
consumer spending as well.

attractive investment and reduced the term premium.4  As shown in the next slide, a 

regression of the 10-year term premium on measures of 10-year inflation expectations 

and a rolling beta of Treasury returns with respect to equity returns (to proxy for the 

hedging value of bonds) shows that these two factors can account for a large part of the 

decline in the term premium.   

Regulations now require many financial institutions to hold more safe, high-

quality liquid assets, which likely has pushed down term premiums further.  Global 

factors may have put downward pressure on term premiums because of anxiety about the 

foreign outlook, which may have increased demand for U.S. assets, or because low rates 

abroad have depressed U.S. term premiums through a global portfolio balance channel.5  

And real rates are quite low globally, reflecting the step-down of productivity growth 

over the past 10 years as well as shifts in savings and investment demand due to 

demographic change.6 

The Core of the Financial System Is Much Stronger 

Before turning to the interplay between low rates and the financial system, I will 

simply point out that both improved risk management at the largest, most systemically 

important financial institutions (SIFIs) and stronger regulation have made the core of 

the system much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.7  The SIFIs have more 

                                                 
4 The changing risk profile of nominal Treasury bonds can be seen from its capital asset pricing model (or 
CAPM) beta, a measure of the co-movement between returns on longer-term Treasury securities and the 
equity market.  Figure A.1 shows that the estimated rolling beta of the 10-year Treasury note with respect 
to the S&P 500 turned from positive to negative around 2000, indicating that Treasury bonds are now likely 
to act as a safe haven, performing well when equity markets do poorly.   
5 Figure A.2 shows the response in daily changes in 10-year U.S. Treasury yields to changes in 10-year 
German bund yields around European Central Bank (ECB) monetary policy decisions since 2010.  The 
significantly positive regression coefficient is evidence of substantial spillovers from ECB monetary policy 
to U.S. long-term yields.

stable funding, hold much more capital and liquidity, are more conscious of their risks, 

and are far more resolvable should they fail.  Many aspects of our financial market 

infrastructure, including the triparty repurchase agreement (or repo) market, central 

counterparties (CCPs), and money market funds, are more robust as well.    

Low Rates Can Mean Tradeoffs  

So far, I have argued that low rates have supported aggregate demand and brought 

us very close to full employment and 2 percent inflation; that forces other than monetary 

policy have been pushing rates lower for more than 30 years; and that the core of the 

financial system is now much stronger and more resilient than before the crisis.  All of 

that said, I would also agree that monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between 

macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.  Indeed, it would be a divine 

coincidence if that were not the case.  There are times when all of these objectives are 

aligned.  For example, the Fed’s initial unconventional policies supported both market 

functioning and aggregate demand.  More broadly, post-crisis monetary policy supported 

asset values, reduced interest payments, and increased both employment and income.  All 

of these effects are likely to have limited defaults and foreclosures and bolstered the 

balance sheets of households, businesses, and financial intermediaries, leaving the system 

more robust.   

But at times there will be tradeoffs.  Low-for-long interest rates can have adverse 

effects on financial institutions and markets through a number of plausible channels, as 

listed on the next slide.8  After all, low interest rates are intended to encourage some risk-

                                                 
8 See Adrian and Liang (2014).

taking.9  The question is whether low rates have encouraged excessive risk-taking 

through the buildup of leverage or unsustainably high asset prices or through 

misallocation of capital.  That question is particularly important today.  Historically, 

recessions often occurred when the Fed tightened to control inflation.  More recently, 

with inflation under control, overheating has shown up in the form of financial excess.  

Core PCE inflation remained close to or below 2 percent during both the late-1990s stock 

market bubble and the mid-2000s housing bubble that led to the financial crisis.  Real 

short- and long-term rates were relatively high in the late 1990s, so financial excess can 

also arise without a low-rate environment.  Nonetheless, the current extended period of 

very low nominal rates calls for a high degree of vigilance against the buildup of risks to 

the stability of the financial system.   

If we look at the channels listed here, the picture is mixed, but the bottom line is 

that there has not been an excessive buildup of leverage, maturity transformation, or 

broadly unsustainable asset prices.   

Low long-term interest rates have weighed on profitability in the financial sector, 

although firms have so far coped with those pressures.  As shown in the next slide, net 

interest margins (NIMs) for most banks have held up surprisingly well.  NIMs have 

moved down for the largest banks.  Return on assets, shown to the right for both groups, 

has recovered but remains below pre-crisis levels.  Life insurers have substantially 

underperformed the broader equity market since 2007, suggesting that investors see the 

low-rate environment as a drag on profitability for the industry.  Even so, data on asset 

                                                 
9 See Dell’Ariccia, Laeven, and Suarez (forthcoming), which finds evidence for a risk-taking channel of 
monetary policy based on supervisory ratings of U.S. bank loans.  Bekaert, Hoerova, and Lo Duca (2013) 
find that accommodative monetary policy shocks lead to a decline in the VIX, a measure of implied 
volatility, by lowering both expected volatility and the risk premium. 


 - 6 - 

portfolios do not suggest that life insurers have increased risk-taking.  The same is true 

for banks.  Both the regulatory environment and banks’ own attitudes toward risk 

following the financial crisis have helped ensure that the largest banks have not taken on 

excessive credit or duration risks relative to their capital cushions. 

Low rates have provided support for asset valuations--indeed, that is part of their 

design.  But I do not see valuations as significantly out of line with historical experience.  

Equity prices have recently increased considerably, pushing the forward price-earnings 

ratio further above its historical median (slide).  And equity premiums (right)--the 

expected return above the risk-free rate for taking equity risk--have declined but are not 

out of line with historical experience.   

In the nonfinancial sector, valuation pressures are most concerning when leverage 

is high, particularly in real estate markets.  Residential real estate valuations have been in 

line with rents and household incomes in recent years, and the ratio of mortgage debt to 

income is well below its pre-crisis peak and still declining.  In contrast, valuations in 

commercial real estate are high in some markets.10  And in the nonfinancial corporate 

sector, gross leverage is high by historical standards.  Low long-term rates have 

encouraged corporate debt issuance at the same time that some regulations, particularly 

the Volcker rule, have discouraged banks from holding and making markets in such debt.  

High-risk corporate debt (the sum of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans) grew rapidly 

in 2013 and 2014 (slide), although growth has declined sharply since then.11  However, 

                                                 
10 The Federal Reserve, along with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation, issued guidance regarding prudent management of risks from loans secured by 
commercial real estate (CRE) in late 2015.  Of course, the annual stress tests typically feature significant 
declines in CRE prices, suggesting that banks are capitalized against a deterioration in this sector. 
11 Gilchrist and Zakrajšek’s (2012) measure of the corporate bond spread, shown in figure A.3, is at about 
its average level, but their estimate of the risk premium in this market is low, so, by this measure, at least 
pricing is rich.

firms also are holding high levels of liquid assets, so net leverage is not elevated.  Firms 

have also lengthened their maturity profiles, and interest coverage ratios are high.  As the 

next slide shows, Greenwood and Hanson’s measure of the share of high-yield debt in 

overall issuance is at a relatively low level.12  And this debt is now held more by 

unlevered investors.  Overall, I do not see leveraged finance markets as posing undue 

financial stability risks.  And if risk-taking does not threaten financial stability, it is not 

the Fed’s job to stop people from losing (or making) money. 

As I said, a mixed picture.  Low interest rates have encouraged risk-taking and 

higher leverage in some sectors and have weighed on profitability in others, but the areas 

where there are signs of excess are isolated. 

Conclusion 

To sum up, low interest rates have supported economic activity and gradually 

brought us back to full employment and 2 percent inflation.  Better regulation and risk 

management have so far minimized the tradeoffs between our macroeconomic objectives, 

on the one hand, and financial stability, on the other.  Still, a period of low rates for a 

long time could present significant challenges for monetary policy.  It could also put 

pressure on the business models of some financial institutions.  Ultimately, the only way 

to get sustainably higher interest rates is to improve the broader environment for growth, 

by adopting policies designed to increase productivity and potential output over the long 

term--policies that are mainly outside the scope of our work at the Federal Reserve.13

• Banking Sector 
o Low rates can hurt net interest margins and may promote greater risk-taking and leverage

• Shadow Banking Sector
o Low rates may also encourage intermediation outside of the regulated banking sector

• Other Financial Firms
o Pension funds with fixed target rates or insurance companies selling products with embedded rate 

floors will be less profitable and may take greater risks to meet their targets 

• Asset Markets
o Low rates may lead to a reach for yield, decreasing risk premiums 

• Nonfinancial Sector
o Households
 Low rates may create housing price bubbles and encourage a run-up in household debt

o Nonfinancial Corporations
 Low rates may promote leverage and excessive risk-taking or low underwriting standards to
