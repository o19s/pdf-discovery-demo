2017 Herbert Stein Memorial Lecture

I am delighted to address the National Economists Club, and I am also honored on 

this occasion to be associated with Herb Stein, whose public service and 

scholarship--characterized by careful analysis, clear-eyed pragmatism, and sharp wit--

exemplified the best in our profession.  Herb was willing to consider new ideas and new 

approaches to government policy, and that openness fits with the subject of my remarks 

today.  Namely, I will discuss the unconventional monetary policy tools used by the 

Federal Reserve since the start of the financial crisis and Great Recession and the role 

that those tools may play in addressing future economic challenges.  

Nearly 10 years ago, with our nation mired in its worst economic and financial 

crisis since the Great Depression, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

confronted a key challenge to the pursuit of its congressionally mandated goals of 

maximum employment and price stability:  how to support a weakening U.S. economy 

once our main conventional policy tool, the federal funds rate, had been lowered to 

essentially zero.  Addressing that problem eventually led to a second challenge:  how to 

ensure that we could scale back monetary policy accommodation in an orderly fashion 

once it was no longer needed.  Failure to meet either challenge would have significantly 

compromised our ability to foster maximum employment and price stability, leading to 

serious consequences for the livelihoods of millions of Americans.  

I will argue today that we have met the first challenge and have made good 

progress to date in meeting the second.  Thanks in part to the monetary policy 

accommodation provided in the aftermath of the crisis--especially through enhanced 

forward rate guidance and large-scale asset purchases--the U.S. economy has made great 

strides.  Indeed, with the economy now operating near maximum employment and 


 - 2 - 

inflation expected to rise to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next couple of 

years, the FOMC has been scaling back the accommodation provided in response to the 

Great Recession.  In no small part because of our authority to pay interest on excess 

reserves, the process of removing policy accommodation is working well. 

After discussing a few issues related to our recent decision to start reducing the 

size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, I will address a key question:  What is the 

appropriate future role of the unconventional policy tools that we deployed to address the 

Great Recession?  While I believe that influencing short-term interest rates should 

continue to be our primary monetary policy lever in normal times, our unconventional 

policy tools will likely be needed again should some future economic downturn drive 

short-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.  Indeed, empirical analysis 

suggests that the neutral federal funds rate--defined as the level of the federal funds rate 

that is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its 

potential--is much lower than in previous decades.  Consequently, the probability that 

short-term interest rates may need to be reduced to their effective lower bound at some 

point is uncomfortably high, even in the absence of a major financial and economic crisis.   

I will return to the question about the future of our various policy tools, but first I 

would like to review our experience this decade, which I view as instructive for 

addressing that question.   

Meeting the Challenge of Providing Additional Accommodation 

A substantial body of evidence suggests that the U.S. economy is much stronger 

today than it would have been without the unconventional monetary policy tools 

deployed by the Federal Reserve in response to the Great Recession.  Two key tools were 


 - 3 - 

large-scale asset purchases and forward guidance about our intentions for the future path 

of short-term interest rates.  The rationale for those tools was straightforward:  Given our 

inability to meaningfully lower short-term interest rates after they reached near-zero in 

late 2008, the FOMC used increasingly explicit forward rate guidance and asset 

purchases to apply downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, which were still well 

above zero.  

Longer-term interest rates reflect, in part, financial market participants’ 

expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates.  As a result, FOMC 

communications that affect those expectations--such as the enhanced forward rate 

guidance provided in our post-meeting statements in the aftermath of the Great 

Recession--can affect longer-term interest rates.1  In addition, longer-term interest rates 

include a term premium, which is the compensation demanded by investors for bearing 

the interest rate risk associated with longer-term securities.  When the Federal Reserve 

buys longer-term securities in the open market, the remaining stock of securities available 

for purchase by the public declines, which pushes the prices of those securities up and 

thus depresses their yields by lowering the term premiums embedded in those yields.2  

Several studies have found that our forward rate guidance and asset purchases did 

appreciably reduce longer-term interest rates.3   

                                                 
1 Before the Great Recession, the FOMC occasionally provided forward rate guidance, but that guidance 
was typically confined to a relatively short horizon. 
2 In addition to depressing term premiums, large-scale asset purchases by the Federal Reserve can lower 
longer-term yields if those purchases are perceived by the public as a signal that short-term interest rates 
are likely to remain lower for longer than previously anticipated.

The FOMC’s goal in lowering longer-term interest rates was to help the U.S. 

economy recover from the recession and stem the disinflationary forces that emerged 

from it.  Some have suggested that the slow pace of the economic recovery proves that 

our unconventional policy tools were ineffective.  However, one should recognize that 

the recovery could have been much slower in the absence of our unconventional tools.  

Indeed, the evidence strongly suggests that forward rate guidance and securities 

purchases--by substantially lowering borrowing costs for millions of American families 

and businesses and making overall financial conditions more accommodative--did help 

spur consumption and business spending, lower the unemployment rate, and stave off 

disinflationary pressures.4  

Other central banks also deployed unconventional policy tools in the years that 

followed the financial crisis.5  Evidence accumulated from their experience also supports 

the notion that these tools have helped stimulate economic activity in their countries after 

their short-term interest rates were lowered to near-zero--and, in some cases, even below 

zero.6

Meeting the Challenge of Scaling Back Accommodation 

By 2014, the U.S. economy was making notable progress toward the FOMC’s 

goals of maximum employment and price stability.  The unemployment rate had dropped 

to 6 percent by midyear--well below its Great Recession peak of 10 percent--and other 

measures of labor market conditions were also showing significant improvement.  In 

addition, inflation, as measured by the change in the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures, had reached about 1-3/4 percent by mid-2014 after hovering 

around 1 percent in the fall of 2013.  Reflecting that progress, the Federal Reserve’s 

focus was shifting from providing additional monetary policy accommodation to scaling 

it back.7  A key question for the FOMC then was how to reduce the degree of 

accommodation in the context of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.   

One possible approach was to start by reducing the Federal Reserve’s securities 

holdings while short-term interest rates remained at the lower bound.  We could allow 

securities to roll off the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and even sell securities, thereby 

putting upward pressure on long-term rates while calibrating the pace and configuration 

of the reduction in our holdings as warranted by our maximum employment and price 

stability objectives.  Eventually, once our securities holdings had shrunk sufficiently, the 

FOMC could start nudging up its short-term interest rate target. 

One problem of this “last in, first out” approach was that the FOMC does not have 

any experience in calibrating the pace and composition of asset redemptions and sales to 

actual and prospective economic conditions.  Indeed, as the so-called taper tantrum of

2013 illustrated, even talk of prospective changes in our securities holdings can elicit 

unexpected abrupt changes in financial conditions.   

Given the lack of experience with reducing our asset holdings to scale back 

monetary policy accommodation and the need to carefully calibrate the removal of 

accommodation, the FOMC opted to allow changes in the Federal Reserve’s securities 

holdings to play a secondary role in the Committee’s normalization strategy.  Rather than 

balance sheet shrinkage, the FOMC decided that its primary tool for scaling back 

monetary policy accommodation would be influencing short-term interest rates.   

As we explained in our “normalization principles” issued in September 2014, the 

FOMC decided to maintain the overall size of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings at 

an elevated level until sometime after the FOMC had begun to raise short-term interest 

rates.8  Once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way” 

and the Committee judged that the economic expansion was strong enough that further 

increases in short-term interest rates were likely to be warranted, the FOMC would 

gradually and predictably reduce the size of the balance sheet by allowing the Federal 

Reserve’s securities holdings to “run off”--that is, we would allow our balance sheet to 

shrink passively by not reinvesting all of the principal payments from our securities.9  

                                                 
8 Information on the FOMC’s Policy Normalization Principles and Plans is available on the Board’s 
website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization.htm. 
9 The FOMC announced in December 2015 that it anticipated maintaining its reinvestment policy until 
normalization of the level of the federal funds rate was “well under way.”  That announcement is available 
on the Board’s website at https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20151216a1.pdf.  
More recently, in June 2017, the FOMC provided additional details regarding its approach to reduce the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, indicating that once the balance sheet normalization plan began, 
principal payments received from securities held by the Federal Reserve would be reinvested only to the 
extent that those payments exceeded certain monthly caps.  The caps would rise gradually but would 
remain in place during the normalization process.  The June 2017 announcement, Addendum to the Policy 
Normalization Principles and Plans, is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_PolicyNormalization.20170613.pdf.

One advantage of the FOMC’s chosen approach to scaling back accommodation 

is that both the FOMC and the public have decades of experience with adjustments in 

short-term interest rates in response to changes in economic conditions.  Nonetheless, the 

post-crisis environment presented a new test to the FOMC’s ability to influence short-

term interest rates. 

Before the crisis, the FOMC could raise the federal funds rate--the rate at which 

banks with excess reserves lend to banks with a reserve need--by removing a small 

amount of reserves from the banking system.  That would translate into a higher federal 

funds rate because reserves were relatively scarce to begin with.  The intuition was 

simple:  The FOMC would signal that it was going to tighten conditions in the reserve 

market, and the cost of obtaining reserves in the market--the federal funds rate--would 

rise.  Other market interest rates would then increase accordingly.   

After the crisis, however, reserves were plentiful because the Federal Reserve 

funded its large-scale asset purchases through adding reserves to the system--crediting 

the bank accounts of those who were selling assets to the Fed.  Moreover, in light of the 

FOMC’s decision not to sell the longer-term securities it acquired, reserves were likely to 

remain plentiful for the foreseeable future.  Consequently, when the time came to remove 

accommodation, a key question for the Committee was how to raise the federal funds rate 

in an environment of abundant reserves.10  An important part of the answer to that 

question came in the Federal Reserve’s authority to pay interest on excess reserves.  The

Congress granted the Federal Reserve that authority in 2006, to become effective in 2011.  

However, in the fall of 2008, the Congress moved up the effective date to October 2008.   

Having authority to pay interest on excess reserves means that the Federal 

Reserve can influence the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates regardless 

of the amount of excess reserves in the banking system.  The mechanics of the new 

framework are straightforward:  Banks will generally only provide short-term funding at 

an interest rate around or above what they could earn at the Fed.  As a result, if the 

Federal Reserve raised the rate it paid, other short-term lending rates would likely rise as 

well.11  This new approach for raising short-term interest rates is working well:  Since 

December 2015, we have raised the interest paid on excess reserves and the target range 

for the federal funds rate by 100 basis points, and the effective federal funds rate has 

risen accordingly.12 

A Closer Look at Our Balance Sheet Strategy 

In light of our recent decision to start reducing our securities holdings this month, 

I would like to discuss a few aspects of our balance sheet strategy.13  The FOMC 

anticipated that its decision to maintain the size of the Federal Reserve’s securities 

                                                 
11 The Federal Reserve created supplementary tools to be used as needed to help strengthen its influence 
over short-term interest rates when reserves are plentiful.  For instance, the overnight reverse repurchase 
agreement facility allows a variety of counterparties, including eligible money market funds, government-
sponsored enterprises, broker-dealers, and depository institutions to invest funds overnight with the Federal 
Reserve at a rate determined by the FOMC.   
12 For a discussion of how increases in the FOMC’s target range for the federal funds rate have transmitted 
to other short-term interest rates, see Alyssa Anderson, Jane Ihrig, Mary-Frances Styczynski, and Gretchen 
C. Weinbach (2017), “How Have the Fed’s Three Rate Hikes Passed through to Selected Short-Term 
Interest Rates?” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, June 2),

holdings at an elevated level until sometime after the beginning of rate hikes would keep 

some downward pressure on longer-term interest rates well after the end of its asset 

purchase programs.  Although estimates of the effect of our securities holdings on longer-

term interest rates are subject to uncertainty, a recent study reported that the Federal 

Reserve’s securities holdings were reducing the term premium on the 10-year Treasury 

yield by roughly 1 percentage point at the end of 2016.14   

The guidance that the FOMC would eventually start a gradual and predictable 

reduction of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings implied that the downward 

pressure on longer-term yields would likely diminish over time as financial market 

participants came to expect that the start of balance sheet normalization was nearing.  

Indeed, with that process now under way, it is likely that our securities holdings are now 

depressing the term premium on the 10-year yield by somewhat less than the 

1 percentage point estimate reported for late last year. 

Several factors suggest that the downward pressure on term premiums exerted by 

our securities holdings is likely to diminish only gradually as our holdings shrink.  For 

instance, as I have already noted, our intention to reduce our balance sheet by reducing 

reinvestment of repayments of principal on our holdings--rather than selling assets--has 

been well communicated for several years now.  As a result, we do not anticipate a jump 

in term premiums as our balance sheet reduction plan gets under way.  In addition, the 

                                                 
14 See Brian Bonis, Jane Ihrig, and Min Wei (2017), “Projected Evolution of the SOMA Portfolio and the 
10-Year Treasury Term Premium Effect,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, September 22), https://doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.2081.   


 - 10 - 

maturity distribution of our securities holdings is such that it will take some years for the 

size of our holdings to normalize via runoff.15   

The judgment that the downward pressure on term premiums will decline only 

gradually as we reduce the size of our balance sheet stands in sharp contrast to evidence 

suggesting that this pressure built up rather quickly when we were expanding our balance 

sheet.  To understand this contrast, remember that, unlike our plan to shrink our balance 

sheet, the various phases of our asset purchases had, to differing degrees, an element of 

surprise, with asset purchase announcements occasionally leaving a distinct imprint on 

the path of longer-term yields.  Moreover, each of our asset purchase programs resulted 

in a rapid increase in our securities holdings during a relatively short period, whereas the 

normalization process will play out gradually over many years. 

I have focused thus far on the likely response of term premiums to our balance 

sheet reduction plan.  Let me turn my attention briefly to the likely response of longer-

term yields, which, as I have noted, reflect both a term premium component and 

expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates.  While the available evidence 

points to a strong reaction of longer-term yields to our asset purchases, it is conceivable 

that those yields will react much more modestly to our balance sheet reduction plan.   

Consider, for instance, a hypothetical scenario in which the FOMC has decided 

not to rely on balance sheet reduction to scale back accommodation, choosing instead to 

continue to reinvest indefinitely all principal payments from the Federal Reserve’s 

                                                 
15 Moreover, as the FOMC announced in June, the Committee decided to cap the monthly run-off in the 
Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, making the balance sheet normalization process even more 
predictable and gradual.  The FOMC’s announcement is available on the Board’s website; see Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), “FOMC Issues Addendum to the Policy Normalization 
Principles and Plans,” press release, June 14, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20170614c.htm.

securities holdings.  If financial market participants perceived no change in the economic 

outlook and no intention on the part of the FOMC to alter the overall stance of monetary 

policy, the FOMC’s inclination to leave the size of the balance sheet unchanged would be 

taken as an indication that the FOMC would instead rely more on increases in short-term 

interest rates to scale back accommodation, resulting in a faster pace of short-term 

interest hikes.  On net, longer-term yields may be little affected by this hypothetical 

scenario:  While the decreased emphasis on balance sheet reduction would depress term 

premiums and hold longer-term yields lower, the expected faster pace of short-term 

interest rate increases would push longer-term yields higher.16   

A Key Question for the Future 

As the financial crisis and Great Recession fade into the past and the stance of 

monetary policy gradually returns to normal, a natural question concerns the possible 

future role of the unconventional policy tools we deployed after the onset of the crisis.  

My colleagues on the FOMC and I believe that, whenever possible, influencing short-

term interest rates by targeting the federal funds rate should be our primary tool.  As I 

have already noted, we have a long track record using this tool to pursue our statutory 

goals.  In contrast, we have much more limited experience with using our securities 

holdings for that purpose.   

Where does this assessment leave our unconventional policy tools?  I believe their 

deployment should be considered again if our conventional tool reaches its limit--that is, 

                                                 
16 In contrast, when the Federal Reserve was purchasing assets, short-term interest rates were at their 
effective lower bound, and they were expected to remain there for the foreseeable future.  As a result, 
decisions to buy additional assets--and the resulting additional downward pressure on term premiums--were 
not offset by expectations of a higher path for short-term interest rates.  The end result was that there was 
greater potential for asset purchases to have a discernible effect on longer-term yields in the years 
immediately following the financial crisis than in current circumstances.   


 - 12 - 

when the federal funds rate has reached its effective lower bound and the U.S. economy 

still needs further monetary policy accommodation.   

Does this mean that it will take another Great Recession for our unconventional 

tools to be used again?  Not necessarily.  Recent studies suggest that the neutral level of 

the federal funds rate appears to be much lower than it was in previous decades.17  

Indeed, most FOMC participants now assess the longer-run value of the neutral federal 

funds rate as only 2-3/4 percent or so, compared with around 4-1/4 percent just a few 

years ago.18  With a low neutral federal funds rate, there will typically be less scope for 

the FOMC to reduce short-term interest rates in response to an economic downturn, 

raising the possibility that we may need to resort again to enhanced forward rate guidance 

and asset purchases to provide needed accommodation.19   

Of course, substantial uncertainty surrounds any estimates of the neutral level of 

short-term interest rates.  In this regard, there is an important asymmetry to consider.  If 

the neutral rate turns out to be significantly higher than we currently estimate, it is less

likely that we will have to deploy our unconventional tools again.  In contrast, if the 

neutral rate is as low as we estimate or even lower, we will be glad to have our 

unconventional tools in our toolkit. 

The bottom line is that we must recognize that our unconventional tools might 

have to be used again.  If we are indeed living in a low-neutral-rate world, a significantly 

less severe economic downturn than the Great Recession might be sufficient to drive 

short-term interest rates back to their effective lower bound.   

Conclusion 

Let me conclude with a brief summary.  As a result of the Great Recession, the 

Federal Reserve has confronted two key challenges over the past several years:  One, the 

FOMC had to provide additional policy accommodation after short-term interest rates 

reached their effective lower bound; and two, subsequently, as we made progress toward 

the achievement of our mandate, we had to start scaling back that accommodation in the 

presence of a vastly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet.   

Today I highlighted two points about the FOMC’s experience with those 

challenges.  First, the monetary policy tools that the Federal Reserve deployed in the 

immediate aftermath of the crisis--explicit forward rate guidance, large-scale asset 

purchases, and the payment of interest on excess reserves--have helped us overcome 

these challenges.   

Second, in light of evidence suggesting that the neutral level of short-term interest 

rates is significantly lower than it was in previous decades, the likelihood that future 

monetary policymakers will have to confront those two challenges again is 

uncomfortably high.  For this reason, we must keep our unconventional policy tools

ready to be deployed again should short-term interest rates return to their effective lower 

bound.
