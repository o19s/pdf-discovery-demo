 The financial crisis highlighted two major vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system.  

First was the magnitude of the too-big-to-fail problem.  Second was the size and fragility of the 

so-called shadow banking system and the extent to which shadow banking activities not subject 

to prudential regulation were integrated with the regulated banking sector.  In the intervening 

years, much has been done to address too-big-to-fail.  With regard to shadow banking concerns, 

the specific forms related to mortgage lending that linked the regulated and unregulated sectors, 

such as the notorious structured investment vehicles (SIVs), collapsed during the crisis.  Changes 

in capital, accounting, and other regulatory standards make these arrangements very unlikely to 

reappear.  Moreover, the kind of very large nonbank financial firms whose failures deepened the 

crisis are now subject to consolidated prudential regulation and supervision.  So, in a quite direct 

sense, the answer to the question posed by this conference of whether we are safer than before 

the crisis is easy to answer in the affirmative. 

 Of course, “safer” does not necessarily mean safe enough.  With respect to the largest 

banks, we continue to pursue the aim of promoting orderly resolution through evaluation of their 

resolution plans and through a long-term debt requirement, as proposed a few weeks ago.  In 

addition, the banking agencies will be proposing a net stable funding ratio rule, aimed at assuring 

adequate medium-term liquidity, in the next few months.  And the Federal Reserve is currently 

engaged in a review of its annual stress testing and capital planning exercises, one goal of which 

is to reflect better the range of risks confronted by these institutions. 

 With respect to shadow banking, the subject of my remarks today, the circumstances are 

somewhat different.  While the specific pre-crisis linkages to the regulated sector have been 

removed or better regulated, the possibility of other connections remains.  More generally, risks 

to financial stability may arise anew from activities mostly or completely outside the ambit of 


-2- 
 


prudentially regulated firms.  Shadow banking is not a single, identifiable “system,” but a 

constantly changing and largely unrelated set of intermediation activities pursued by very 

different types of financial market actors.  Indeed, the very rigor of post-crisis reforms to 

prudential regulation may create new opportunities for such activities.  The aphoristic warning to 

avoid too much emphasis on fighting the last war, since wholly new risks may have arisen, 

seems particularly applicable in this area.   

 Yet there is simultaneously the opposite danger that the regulatory response to shadow 

banking will be too broad and too unidimensional.  Indeed, the very term “shadow banking” tilts 

in that direction.  This afternoon, I will try to identify some of the considerations that could help 

navigate between the perils of underappreciating the risks to financial stability arising from, and 

the costs from overreacting to, new forms of nonbank financial intermediation.  Along the way I 

will make a few points.  One is that, analytically, it is essential to disaggregate the various 

activities that fall under the loose term shadow banking and to assess the risks and benefits they 

present on a discrete basis.  A second is that, notwithstanding the manifold nature of nonbank 

intermediation, it remains useful to identify the relationship of specific activities to the 

prudentially regulated sector.  A third is that institutional considerations will be important in 

defining the potential, and actual, regulatory responses to nonbank intermediation.  

The Legacy of Shadow Banking  

As you have probably noticed already, I have some misgivings about the continued use of 

the term shadow banking as a shorthand for various forms of nonbank financial intermediation 

that may need a regulatory response.  The term conjures up a picture of lending and borrowing 

that resembles activity associated with, but not conducted by, commercial banks which is both 

over- and under-inclusive of actual risks to financial stability.  Before elaborating on this point, 


-3- 
 


though, let me review how the phrase does capture well the activities that played such a large 

part in precipitating and exacerbating the financial crisis.1 

Before 2007, large banks provided credit and liquidity support, whether explicit or 

implicit, for a range of intermediation entities, including finance companies, nonbank mortgage 

lenders, SIVs, and asset-backed commercial paper conduits.  All of these entities engaged in 

maturity and liquidity transformation, frequently accompanied by significant leverage.  Many 

created, through securitization or otherwise, assets that were viewed as cash equivalents--safe, 

short-term, and liquid.  That is, at least in normal times, they were seen as comparable to demand 

deposits created by the traditional banking sector.  Thus, what we might refer to as the 

prototypical form of shadow banking presented the kind of risk associated with traditional 

banking prior to the creation of deposit insurance--that of destabilizing short-term creditor runs 

that lead to defaults and asset fire sales.   

Bank sponsorship contributed to the illusion that the shadow banks’ short-term liabilities 

were virtually as good as cash.  Large banks also relied on short-term wholesale funding 

provided by the shadow banking sector as a source of cheap financing.  Then, questions arose 

about the quality of the mortgage loans and other assets underlying the liabilities of SIVs and 

asset-backed commercial paper conduits and, simultaneously, about the continued willingness 

and capacity of their sponsors to support them.  Suddenly, asset-backed commercial paper was 

no longer seen as a cash equivalent, and a run ensued.  Large investment banks also experienced 

dramatic runs on their short-term, secured wholesale funding.  Another powerful run occurred,

this time on money market mutual funds, after Lehman Brothers’ shadow banking activities 

caused it to fail and the Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck.   

   As noted earlier, some key elements of pre-crisis shadow banking such as SIVs have 

vanished, and some key actors of that earlier period have been brought within the bounds of 

prudential regulation.  Today, the shadow banking sector is smaller and the traditional banking 

sector is more resilient.  Nonetheless, abundant global liquidity continues to seek out safe assets, 

and some financial market participants will continue to accept maturity and liquidity mismatches 

in order to earn incrementally higher yields.  The risks associated with short-term wholesale 

funding in particular have more receded than disappeared.  Accordingly, the prototype of the 

precarious shadow banking model can generate new variants that should command regulatory 

attention.  Before returning to this issue, though, I want to speak more directly to why and how 

we should analyze the risks and benefits associated with specific forms of nonbank financial 

intermediation, rather than make regulatory decisions based upon the fact that a particular form 

of intermediation bears some resemblance to the borrowing or lending activities traditionally 

associated with commercial banks.    

Analyzing Nonbank Intermediation 

 Switching from a focus on “shadow banking” to a consideration of the varieties of 

nonbank intermediation reinforces the importance of assessing specific risks rather than merely 

categorizing activities as either shadow banking or something else.  In this way, the potential 

over-inclusiveness for financial stability purposes of the tag “shadow banking” can be better 

avoided.  Even nonbank intermediaries that engage in lending to consumers or small businesses 

are not monolithic, insofar as the sources of their funding--and thus attendant run risks--may 

differ markedly.   


-5- 
 


On the other hand, financial stability risks are not limited to entities or activities that 

seem to replicate the kind of lending conventionally associated with commercial banks.  This is 

where the potential under-inclusiveness of the shadow banking category arises.  Here again, 

though, it is important not to leap to the conclusion that where some risks do exist, they should 

be addressed in a uniform manner.  For example, some classes of asset managers, such as bond 

funds that hold relatively illiquid assets while offering their investors the right to withdraw funds 

on very short notice, may pose redemption risks.  But intermediaries such as many conventional 

mutual funds do not pose bank-like risks, since they generally are not leveraged.  So, if further 

analysis supports the conclusion that redemption risks are real, the optimal regulatory response 

would surely not be one that treats all asset managers as quasi-banks that need to have capital 

and similar bank regulatory constraints.2 

An emphasis on actual risks can lead to the conclusion that some nonbank financial 

entities or activities do not pose material threats to financial stability at all.  Pension funds, for 

example, are surely an important form of intermediation.  If, over time, they do not have assets 

sufficient to meet their promises to plan participants, whether because they have been 

underfunded in the traditional sense or because they have lost money through ill-considered 

investments, hardship will undoubtedly follow.  If enough pension plans fell short of 

expectations, there might be macroeconomic consequences.  And if they provide short-term 

funding in order to increase returns on the assets they need to keep liquid, they might contribute 

to the risks assumed by other kinds of intermediaries.  But, in themselves, they are unlikely to 

pose financial stability risks.  Similar reasoning would apply to traditional insurance activities. 

                                                 
2 Some mutual funds may in fact use a form of synthetic leveraging that could complicate an assessment of financial 
stability implications.  See 80 Fed. Reg. 62279 (October 15, 2015), footnote 35.

 Even as the risks associated with specific forms of nonbank intermediation are evaluated, 

it is important also to bear in mind the specific economic benefits of those activities.  Nonbank 

intermediaries can increase the diversity of the economy’s capital providers.  For example, the 

creation and eventual proliferation of equity mutual funds offered a variety of savings options to 

American households for which ownership of a diversified portfolio of equities is either 

practically burdensome or financially impossible.  This development posed a challenge for the 

liability side of banks’ balance sheets, as households reduced the share of their savings in 

traditional bank deposits.  But it is hard to argue that this challenge would have merited limiting 

the availability of mutual funds. 

Nonbank intermediaries can also provide credit to borrowers that are underserved or 

unserved by traditional banks.  It could be argued that one example of such nonbank activity is 

online marketplace lending that uses new sources of data and new technologies to lower the 

fixed costs of making credit decisions, rendering lending to some individuals and small 

businesses more cost-effective.  Of course, it matters a great deal whether this competition to 

traditional banks arises because risks are genuinely lower or useful new products have been 

created, on the one hand, or because well-grounded prudential or consumer regulations have 

been successfully avoided, on the other.3   

A key implication of the fact that the activities often grouped under the heading shadow 

banking are not monolithic is that the level of a particular activity is less important than the 

degree of vulnerability that it creates.  Not all of what some might call shadow banking activity 

represents a market failure that creates excessive risk to financial stability, and so it would be

wrong to assume that all shadow banking ought to be regulated to safeguard financial stability.  

This view is reflected in the Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report for 2015, which has just 

been issued by the Financial Stability Board.  The report begins by including all activities that 

could arguably be included in the very broad category of shadow banking, but then classifies 

these activities by economic function and risks.  The result is about a 70 percent decrease in the 

amount of intermediation otherwise captured by the broader definition.4 

Thus, assessing whether regulation is appropriate for specific forms of nonbank 

intermediation requires a balancing of the resulting increase in socially beneficial credit, capital, 

or savings options against any associated increase in risks to the safety and stability of the 

financial system as a whole.  The chief relevant factors to consider include the extent of reliance 

on maturity or liquidity transformation, the creation of cash equivalent assets, the use of 

leverage, and the degree of interconnection with the traditional banking sector.   

 When growth in nonbank intermediation reflects a migration of traditional banking 

activities to less-regulated entities, a number of similar considerations are relevant to an 

evaluation of the costs and benefits of the migration and the potential need for a regulatory 

response.  Here, where the activity is probably quite bank-like, I am going to revert to the use of 

the term shadow bank.   

First, to what extent does the activity, as practiced by shadow banks, entail reliance on 

leverage or on maturity or liquidity transformation that could lead to a bank-like creditor run 

dynamic?  Bank regulation is primarily aimed at preventing the occurrence of such destabilizing

runs or minimizing their ill effects, and so the need for bank-like regulation is greater in the 

presence of material run risk.   

Second, are banks still informally or indirectly at risk despite the migration to nonbank 

entities?  This could be the case if banks sponsor the shadow banks and implicitly or explicitly 

provide them with a liquidity backstop or credit support, and it would call for greater regulatory 

attention either to the shadow banks conducting the activity or to the banks’ connection with 

those shadow banks.   

Third, is the activity at issue primarily migrating out of the most systemic banks--global 

systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs)--or smaller banks?  Migration of activity 

out of GSIBs might on net be beneficial for financial stability because it would leave the GSIBs 

less systemic, even if the activity migrates to less-regulated shadow banks, though I would 

caution that an especially careful analysis would be needed before reaching this conclusion.   

In this regard, I would note that one way to limit the growth of shadow banking that 

simply arbitrages bank regulation is to make sure that the regulated sector itself is not 

unnecessarily burdened.  This aim lies behind our efforts to tailor banking regulation by 

reference to the risks posed to the economy and the financial system by banks of different sizes, 

scopes, and business activities.   

In addition, it suggests a couple of additional considerations for evaluating specific forms 

of shadow banking.  Here, though, the relevance of these considerations is for determining 

whether to adjust banking regulation, as much as it is for determining whether regulation of the 

shadow banks would be warranted.  One such consideration is whether the activity is high-risk, 

and whether banks have a good track record in addressing the attendant risks.  Migration may be 

of less concern where banks historically have done a poor job of managing the risks of the 


-9- 
 


activity.  Another salient consideration is whether the activity at issue has significant synergies 

with core banking activities.  If so, then migration out of the traditional banking sector could 

damage the efficiency of banks and increase their vulnerability. 

Short-Term Wholesale Funding 

 While I favor assessment of the specific risks and costs associated with a particular form 

of nonbank intermediation, I also believe that the greatest risks to financial stability are the 

funding runs and asset fire sales associated with reliance on short-term wholesale funding, and 

thus I place particular emphasis on this factor.  If there is one lesson to be drawn from the 

financial crisis, it is that the rapid withdrawal of funding by short-term credit providers can lead 

to systemic problems as consequential as those associated with classic runs on traditional banks.5  

When financial intermediaries must rapidly liquidate a substantial amount of longer-term assets 

that they can no longer fund, the impact can reverberate throughout the financial system.  The 

resulting declines in asset prices can trigger margin calls on other investors, who themselves may 

need to de-lever by selling their own holdings, adding to the fire sale-induced price impact on 

these, and potentially other, assets.  In the worst case, the result can be the kind of generalized 

asset price decline and liquidity freeze observed at the height of the financial crisis.   

The total amount of short-term wholesale funding within the financial system is lower 

today than immediately before the crisis, but volumes are still large relative to the size of the 

financial system.  For example, nearly half of the liabilities of broker-dealers consist of short-

term wholesale funding, an amount that is nearly the same as it was during the crisis.6  

Numerous regulatory reforms have addressed the use of short-term wholesale funding by

Papers on Economic Activity (Washington: Brookings Institution, Fall).

Conference of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, October 2, Table 1.

prudentially regulated institutions.  The Board has finalized the liquidity coverage ratio7 and is 

developing the net stable funding ratio to diminish large banks’ vulnerability to abrupt changes 

in short-term wholesale markets.  The Board’s annual Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and 

Review provides an opportunity for supervisors to assess and, where necessary to contain risks, 

require changes to the specific funding practices of large banking organizations.8  Finally, in 

order to increase the resilience of firms that continue to use significant amounts of such funding, 

we have also incorporated a measure of a firm’s reliance on short-term wholesale funding into 

the calibration of both the capital surcharge for U.S. GSIBs and our proposed long-term debt 

requirement for those firms.9   

These measures, applicable as they are only to prudentially regulated banking 

organizations, do nothing to address the risks of short-term wholesale funding by nonbank 

intermediaries.  Indeed, constraints imposed on banking organizations may prompt more short-

term wholesale funding to migrate outside the regulated sector.  In the past, bank backstops were 

generally needed for shadow banks to obtain substantial amounts of such funding.  But it is not 

so far-fetched to think that, with time and sufficient economic incentive, the financial, 

technological, and regulatory barriers to the disintermediation of prudentially regulated banking 

firms could be overcome.  Indeed, we have observed some investment funds exploring the 

possibility of disintermediating dealers by lending cash against securities collateral to other 

market participants.  While it would be inadvisable to apply bank-style regulation to all entities 

that make use of short-term wholesale funding, a degree of consistent regulatory treatment is

desirable to address bank-like risks in the shadow banking sector and to forestall regulatory 

arbitrage. 

 The Board has advocated for international measures to forestall the development of 

highly volatile funding structures outside the regulated sector.  Consistent with this position, we 

will be developing a regulation that would establish minimum haircuts for securities financing 

transactions (SFTs) on a market-wide basis, rather than just for specific classes of market 

participants.  SFTs include repo, reverse repo, securities lending and borrowing, and securities 

margin lending--transactions that are the lifeblood of many kinds of shadow banks.  SFTs are a 

key component of the healthy functioning of the securities market.  But, in the absence of 

sensible regulation, they also carry the potential for prompting the fire sale dynamic described 

earlier.  While the haircuts and other conditions associated with SFTs today are considerably 

more conservative than during the period leading up to the crisis, there is good reason to believe 

that this conservatism could be eroded as economic conditions continue to improve and credit 

growth accelerates. 

 A system of numerical haircut floors for SFTs would require any entity that wants to 

borrow against a security to post a minimum amount of excess margin to its lender, with the 

amount varying depending on the asset class of the collateral.  Like the minimum margin 

requirements that U.S. regulators have imposed on derivatives contracts, numerical floors for 

SFT haircuts would serve as a mechanism for limiting the build-up of leverage in the financial 

system.  They could also mitigate the risk to financial stability posed by pro-cyclical margin calls 

during times of financial stress, since putting a regulatory floor under SFT haircuts during good 

times would reduce the amount by which they would increase during periods of stress.

Institutional Considerations 

 While the analytics of shadow banking, or nonbank intermediation more generally, lean 

toward a case-by-case balancing of risks and economic benefits, significant institutional issues 

also need to be addressed.  Today I will mention only two.  

First is the issue of what form of regulation is appropriate once analysis suggests that a 

response is needed.  By authorizing the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) to 

designate nonbanks as systemically important institutions, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 

and Consumer Protection Act fills the gap that existed in the pre-crisis period, when firms like 

Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG largely escaped the perimeter of prudential regulation.  

Designation by FSOC places firms under the regulation and supervision of the Federal Reserve 

Board.  While the Board can shape the particulars of its oversight to the nature of each 

designated firm, the statute requires liquidity standards, risk management standards, resolution 

plans, and concentration limits, with the additional strong presumption of capital standards. 

 As important as the designation authority is to preclude the Lehmans or AIGs of the 

future, it is almost surely not the optimal regulatory approach for most activities that can be 

characterized as shadow banking or that are conducted by nonbank intermediaries so as to raise 

financial stability concerns.  The vast majority of firms engaged in such activities will not satisfy 

the statutory test for designation.  In any case, it is unclear that all of the statutory prudential 

requirements for designated firms would be necessary or appropriate in dealing with the risks to 

financial stability posed by the activities of these firms.  In many instances, and especially where 

funding vulnerabilities are at the heart of a business model, it is the activity itself that needs to be 

regulated in some way, whether there are a few large firms involved or many smaller ones. 


-13- 
 


A tool that might be better targeted to actual risks, while avoiding unnecessary “bank-

like” regulation would be what I have previously termed “prudential market regulation”--that is, 

a policy framework that builds on the traditional investor-protection and market-functioning 

aims of market regulation by incorporating a system-wide financial stability perspective.  This 

approach would take into account such considerations as system-wide demands on liquidity 

during stress periods and correlated risks that could exacerbate liquidity, redemption, or fire sale 

pressures.  The specific policies associated with prudential market regulation might be 

transaction-specific or apply to certain kinds of business models.   

One example of such a measure is the SFT minimum haircut idea I mentioned earlier.  

Generally, though, prudential market regulation would be a tool more available to market 

regulators, since it would apply to activities on a market or transactional basis.  In her important 

speech last year, Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Jo White provided a 

roadmap for just such a regulatory approach for the asset management industry.10  The SEC has 

since begun to develop that approach.11  

The second institutional issue is the question of which regulators would make the 

assessment and policy tradeoffs that I contemplate in addressing financial stability risks 

associated with nonbank financial intermediation.  The natural answer would be the regulator 

with authority to act.  While this may well be the best answer from a policy perspective, it does 

raise some potential issues on its own.  For example, if regulators with responsibility for one 

sector believe that the failure of regulators with responsibility for another sector to act on 

financial stability concerns is creating debilitating disadvantages for firms in the first sector, they

might be tempted to relax regulation on their firms, even though they might agree that the best 

outcome would be to retain their existing regulations but have the other sector subject to some 

constraints as well.  This seems to me not a bad description of what happened in banking for a 

good part of the three decades beginning in the mid-1970s, when the banking agencies pursued a 

variety of deregulatory measures in part because they believed that the franchise of commercial 

banking was being eroded by various capital market activities that were not subject to 

appropriate prudential requirements. 

Conclusion 

 The Financial Stability Board study to which I referred earlier notes that the growth of 

shadow banking in the United States in recent years has been relatively modest.  With the 

regulated financial sector so much more resilient than in pre-crisis days, the financial system as a 

whole is obviously safer.  Moreover, much of the innovation occurring in lending and payments 

arenas today carries the promise of genuinely increased efficiency, and does not appear to be just 

an arbitrage against the stronger post-crisis regulatory regime.   

But if history is any guide, the grace period we are now experiencing will not last forever.  

New forms of intermediation may carry new risks, or older forms may acquire new risks as they 

expand and adapt to new circumstances.  If we are to pursue a policy of case-by-case assessment 

that permits healthy forms of nonbank intermediation while protecting the financial system, 

financial regulators will need to develop effective and supple mechanisms for what I have termed 

prudential market regulation.
