Financial Stability a Decade after the Onset of the Crisis

“Fostering a Dynamic Global Recovery,” a symposium sponsored by

August 25, 2017 





A decade has passed since the beginnings of a global financial crisis that resulted 

in the most severe financial panic and largest contraction in economic activity in the 

United States since the Great Depression.  Already, for some, memories of this 

experience may be fading--memories of just how costly the financial crisis was and of 

why certain steps were taken in response.  Today I will look back at the crisis and discuss 

the reforms policymakers in the United States and around the world have made to 

improve financial regulation to limit both the probability and the adverse consequences of 

future financial crises.   

A resilient financial system is critical to a dynamic global economy--the subject 

of this conference.  A well-functioning financial system facilitates productive investment 

and new business formation and helps new and existing businesses weather the ups and 

downs of the business cycle.  Prudent borrowing enables households to improve their 

standard of living by purchasing a home, investing in education, or starting a business.  

Because of the reforms that strengthened our financial system, and with support from 

monetary and other policies, credit is available on good terms, and lending has advanced 

broadly in line with economic activity in recent years, contributing to today’s strong 

economy.1    

At the same time, reforms have boosted the resilience of the financial system.   

Banks are safer.  The risk of runs owing to maturity transformation is reduced.  Efforts to 

enhance the resolvability of systemic firms have promoted market discipline and reduced 

                                                 
1 Over the 12 quarters ending in the first quarter of this year, borrowing by the nonfinancial business sector 

increased at an annual rate just above 6 percent, on average, and borrowing by households and nonprofit 

institutions rose at an annual rate of 3-1/4 percent, on average; the corresponding average pace of increase 

in nominal gross domestic product was 3-3/4 percent.  Over the same period, lending by private depository 

institutions advanced at an annual rate of nearly 6-1/2 percent.

the problem of too-big-to-fail.  And a system is in place to more effectively monitor and 

address risks that arise outside the regulatory perimeter.   

Nonetheless, the scope and complexity of financial regulatory reforms demand 

that policymakers and researchers remain alert to both areas for improvement and 

unexpected side effects.  The Federal Reserve is committed to continuing to evaluate the 

effects of regulation on financial stability and on the broader economy and to making 

appropriate adjustments. 

I will start by reviewing where we were 10 years ago.  I will then walk through 

some key reforms our country has put in place to diminish the chances of another severe 

crisis and limit damage during times of financial instability.  After reviewing these steps, 

I will summarize indicators and research that show the improved resilience of the U.S. 

financial system--resilience that is due importantly to regulatory reform as well as actions 

taken by the private sector.  I will then turn to the evidence regarding how financial 

regulatory reform has affected economic growth, credit availability, and market liquidity.   

Developments 10 Years Ago  

The U.S. and global financial system was in a dangerous place 10 years ago.  U.S. 

house prices had peaked in 2006, and strains in the subprime mortgage market grew acute 

over the first half of 2007.2  By August, liquidity in money markets had deteriorated 

enough to require the Federal Reserve to take steps to support it.3  And yet the discussion

3 On August 17, 2007, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the primary credit rate at the discount window 

by 50 basis points and announced a change to the Reserve Banks’ usual practices to allow the provision of 

term financing for as long as 30 days, renewable by the borrower.  The changes were announced to remain 

in place until the Federal Reserve determined that market liquidity had improved materially.  See Board of

here at Jackson Hole in August 2007, with a few notable exceptions, was fairly optimistic 

about the possible economic fallout from the stresses apparent in the financial system.4  

As we now know, the deterioration of liquidity and solvency within the financial 

sector continued over the next 13 months.  Accumulating strains across the financial 

system, including the collapse of Bear Stearns in March 2008, made it clear that 

vulnerabilities had risen across the system.  As a result, policymakers took extraordinary 

measures:  The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sharply cut the federal funds 

rate, and the Federal Reserve, in coordination with the Treasury Department and other 

agencies, extended liquidity facilities beyond the traditional banking sector, applying to 

the modern structure of U.S. money markets the dictum of Walter Bagehot, conceived in 

the 19th century, to lend freely against good collateral at a penalty rate.5  Still, the 

deterioration in the financial sector continued, with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac failing 

in early September.6   

But the deterioration from early 2007 until early September 2008--already the 

worst financial disruption in the United States in many decades--was a slow trickle

compared with the tidal wave that nearly wiped out the financial sector that September 

and led to a plunge in economic activity in the following months.  Not long after Fannie 

and Freddie were placed in government conservatorship, Lehman Brothers collapsed, 

setting off a week in which American International Group, Inc. (AIG), came to the brink 

of failure and required large loans from the Federal Reserve to mitigate the systemic 

fallout; a large money market fund “broke the buck” (that is, was unable to maintain a net 

asset value of $1 per share) and runs on other money funds accelerated, requiring the 

Treasury to provide a guarantee of money fund liabilities; global dollar funding markets 

nearly collapsed, necessitating coordinated action by central banks around the world; the 

two remaining large investment banks became bank holding companies, thereby ending 

the era of large independent investment banks in the United States; and the Treasury 

proposed a rescue of the financial sector.  Within several weeks, the Congress passed--

and President Bush signed into law--the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, 

which established the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program; the Federal Reserve 

initiated further emergency lending programs; and the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) guaranteed a broad range of bank debt.7  Facing similar challenges in 

their own jurisdictions, many foreign governments also undertook aggressive measures to 

support the functioning of credit markets, including large-scale capital injections into 

banks, expansions of deposit insurance programs, and guarantees of some forms of bank 

debt.  

                                                 
7 In the fall of 2008, the three largest investment banks were (in alphabetical order) Goldman Sachs, Merrill 

Lynch, and Morgan Stanley.  Merrill Lynch agreed to be acquired by Bank of America, and the remaining 

two firms became bank holding companies.

Despite the forceful policy responses by the Treasury, the Congress, the FDIC, 

and the Federal Reserve as well as authorities abroad, the crisis continued to intensify:  

The vulnerabilities in the U.S. and global economies had grown too large, and the 

subsequent damage was enormous.  From the beginning of 2008 to early 2010, nearly 

9 million jobs, on net, were lost in the United States.  Millions of Americans lost their 

homes.  And distress was not limited to the U.S. economy:  Global trade and economic 

activity contracted to a degree that had not been seen since the 1930s.  The economic 

recovery that followed, despite extraordinary policy actions, was painfully slow.   

What the Crisis Revealed and How Policymakers Have Responded 

These painful events renewed efforts to guard against financial instability.  The 

Congress, the Administration, and regulatory agencies implemented new laws, 

regulations, and supervisory practices to limit the risk of another crisis, in coordination 

with policymakers around the world. 

The vulnerabilities within the financial system in the mid-2000s were numerous 

and, in hindsight, familiar from past financial panics.  Financial institutions had assumed 

too much risk, especially related to the housing market, through mortgage lending 

standards that were far too lax and contributed to substantial overborrowing.  Repeating a 

familiar pattern, the “madness of crowds” had contributed to a bubble, in which investors 

and households expected rapid appreciation in house prices.  The long period of 

economic stability beginning in the 1980s had led to complacency about potential risks, 

and the buildup of risk was not widely recognized.8  As a result, market and supervisory 

                                                 
8 The notion that popular sentiment may contribute to mispricing of assets--for example, the power of the 

madness of crowds--is attributed to Charles Mackay (1841), Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions 

and the Madness of Crowds (London:  Richard Bentley).  A more modern perspective, and one using a

discipline was lacking, and financial institutions were allowed to take on high levels of 

leverage.  This leverage was facilitated by short-term wholesale borrowing, owing in part 

to market-based vehicles, such as money market mutual funds and asset-backed 

commercial paper programs that allowed the rapid expansion of liquidity transformation 

outside of the regulated depository sector.  Finally, a self-reinforcing loop developed, in 

which all of the factors I have just cited intensified as investors sought ways to gain 

exposure to the rising prices of assets linked to housing and the financial sector.  As a 

result, securitization and the development of complex derivatives products distributed 

risk across institutions in ways that were opaque and ultimately destabilizing. 

In response, policymakers around the world have put in place measures to limit a 

future buildup of similar vulnerabilities.  The United States, through coordinated 

regulatory action and legislation, moved very rapidly to begin reforming our financial 

system, and the speed with which our banking system returned to health provides 

evidence of the effectiveness of that strategy.  Moreover, U.S. leadership of global efforts 

through bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial 

Stability Board (FSB), and the Group of Twenty has contributed to the development of 

standards that promote financial stability around the world, thereby supporting global 

growth while protecting the U.S. financial system from adverse developments abroad.   

                                                 
phrase as memorable as the madness of crowds, is provided by Robert J. Shiller (2016), Irrational 

Exuberance, 3rd ed. (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press).  The notion that economic stability can 

generate a buildup of imbalances that subsequently contributes to instability is presented in Hyman P. 

Minsky (1974), “The Modeling of Financial Instability:  An Introduction,” in Modeling and Simulation, 

Vol. 5, Part 1, proceedings of the Fifth Annual Pittsburgh Conference (Pittsburgh:  Instrument Society of 

America), pp. 267-72, http://digitalcommons.bard.edu/hm_archive/467.  A related discussion of how 

financial excesses often precede downturns (and even panics) is provided in Charles P. Kindleberger and

Preeminent among these domestic and global efforts have been steps to increase the loss-

absorbing capacity of banks, regulations to limit both maturity transformation in short-

term funding markets and liquidity mismatches within banks, and new authorities to 

facilitate the resolution of large financial institutions and to subject systemically 

important firms to more stringent prudential regulation. 

Several important reforms have increased the loss-absorbing capacity of global 

banks.  First, the quantity and quality of capital required relative to risk-weighted assets 

have been increased substantially.9  In addition, a simple leverage ratio provides a 

backstop, reflecting the lesson imparted by past crises that risk weights are imperfect and 

a minimum amount of equity capital should fund a firm’s total assets.  Moreover, both 

the risk-weighted and simple leverage requirements are higher for the largest, most 

systemic firms, which lowers the risk of distress at such firms and encourages them to 

limit activities that could threaten financial stability.10  Finally, the largest U.S. banks 

participate in the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR)--the 

                                                 
9 These improvements encompass a number of changes.  The regulatory requirements for capital have been 

increased and focus on Tier 1 common equity, which proved more capable of absorbing losses than lower-

quality forms of capital.  The role of bank internal models in determining risk-weighted assets also has 

been significantly constrained in the United States.  In addition, exposures previously considered off 

balance sheet have been incorporated into risk-weighted assets. 
10 The Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency adopted a final 

rule to strengthen the leverage ratio standards for the largest, most interconnected U.S. banking 

organizations on April 8, 2014.  Under the final rule, covered bank holding companies must maintain a 

leverage buffer of 2 percentage points above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 

3 percent, for a total of 5 percent, to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus 

payments (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 

and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (2014), “Agencies Adopt Enhanced Supplementary 

Leverage Ratio Final Rule and Issue Supplementary Leverage Ratio Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,” joint 

press release, April 8, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20140408a.htm).  

The Federal Reserve approved a final rule imposing risk-based capital surcharges on the largest, most 

systemically important U.S. bank holding companies on July 20, 2015; in connection with the final rule, the 

Board issued a white paper describing the calibration of the risk-based capital surcharges (see Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2015), “Federal Reserve Board Approves Final Rule Requiring 

the Largest, Most Systemically Important U.S. Bank Holding Companies to Further Strengthen Their 

Capital Positions,” press release, July 20, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20150720a.htm).

stress tests.  In addition to contributing to greater loss-absorbing capacity, the CCAR 

improves public understanding of risks at large banking firms, provides a forward-

looking examination of firms’ potential losses during severely adverse economic 

conditions, and has contributed to significant improvements in risk management. 

Reforms have also addressed the risks associated with maturity transformation.  

The fragility created by deposit-like liabilities outside the traditional banking sector has 

been mitigated by regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

affecting prime institutional money market funds.  These rules require these prime funds 

to use a floating net asset value, among other changes, a shift that has made these funds 

less attractive as cash-management vehicles.  The changes at money funds have also 

helped reduce banks’ reliance on unsecured short-term wholesale funding, since prime 

institutional funds were significant investors in those bank liabilities.  Liquidity risk at 

large banks has been further mitigated by a new liquidity coverage ratio and a capital 

surcharge for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs).  The liquidity coverage ratio 

requires that banks hold liquid assets to cover potential net cash outflows over a 30-day 

stress period.  The capital surcharge for U.S. G-SIBs links the required level of capital for 

the largest banks to their reliance on short-term wholesale funding.11 

While improvements in capital and liquidity regulation will limit the reemergence 

of the risks that grew substantially in the mid-2000s, the failure of Lehman Brothers 

demonstrated how the absence of an adequate resolution process for dealing with a 

                                                 
11 Moreover, the Federal Reserve’s Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review, in which supervisors 

analyze the liquidity risks and practices at large banks, has promoted improvements in liquidity-risk 

management.  The U.S. banking agencies also have proposed a net stable funding ratio (NSFR) to help 

ensure that large banks have a stable funding profile over a one-year horizon, and we are working toward 

finalization of the NSFR.

failing systemic firm left policymakers with only the terrible choices of a bailout or 

allowing a destabilizing collapse.  In recognition of this shortcoming, the Congress 

adopted the orderly liquidation authority in Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) to provide an alternative 

resolution mechanism for systemically important firms to be used instead of bankruptcy 

proceedings when necessary to preserve financial stability.  The orderly liquidation 

authority contains a number of tools, including liquidity resources and temporary stays on 

the termination of financial contracts, that would help protect the financial system and 

economy from the severe adverse spillovers that could occur if a systemic firm failed.  

Importantly, any losses incurred by the government in an Orderly Liquidation Authority 

resolution would not be at the expense of taxpayers, since the statute provides that all 

such losses must be borne by other large financial firms through subsequent assessments.  

In addition, the Congress required that the largest banks submit living wills that describe 

how they could be resolved under bankruptcy.12  And the Federal Reserve has mandated 

that systemically important banks meet total loss-absorbing capacity requirements, which 

require these firms to maintain long-term debt adequate to absorb losses and recapitalize 

the firm in resolution.  These enhancements in resolvability protect financial stability and 

help ensure that the shareholders and creditors of failing firms bear losses.  Moreover, 

these steps promote market discipline, as creditors--knowing full well that they will bear 

                                                 
12 In addition to these steps, the Board issued another proposal to make G-SIBs more resolvable in May of 

last year (see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Board Proposes 

Rule to Support U.S. Financial Stability by Enhancing the Resolvability of Very Large and Complex 

Financial Firms,” press release, May 3, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20160503b.htm).  This proposed rule would 

impose restrictions on G-SIBs’ qualified financial contracts--including derivatives and repurchase 

agreements (or repos)--to guard against the rapid, mass unwinding of those contracts during the resolution 

of a G-SIB.  The proposed restrictions are a key step toward G-SIB resolvability because rapidly unwinding 

these contracts could destabilize the financial system by causing asset fire sales and toppling other firms.

losses in the event of distress--demand prudent risk-taking, thereby limiting the problem 

of too-big-to-fail.   

Financial stability risks can also grow large outside the regulated banking sector, 

as amply demonstrated by the events of 2007 and 2008.  In response, a number of 

regulatory changes affecting what is commonly referred to as the shadow banking sector 

have been instituted.  A specific example of such risks, illustrative of broader 

developments, was the buildup of large counterparty exposures through derivatives 

between market participants and AIG that were both inappropriately risk-managed and 

opaque.  To mitigate the potential for such risks to arise again, new standards require 

central clearing of standardized over-the-counter derivatives, enhanced reporting 

requirements for all derivatives, and higher capital as well as margin requirements for 

noncentrally cleared derivatives transactions.13 

Another important step was the Congress’s creation of the Financial Stability 

Oversight Council (FSOC).  The council is responsible for identifying risks to financial 

stability and for designating those financial institutions that are systemically important 

and thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve.  Both of these 

responsibilities are important to help guard against the risk that vulnerabilities outside the 

existing regulatory perimeter grow to levels that jeopardize financial stability.14  

                                                 
13 One area in which regulations have shifted to a lesser degree in the United States is that of time-varying 

macroprudential tools, in which regulatory requirements are adjusted to address changes in vulnerabilities 

that may affect the financial system.  For example, U.S. regulatory authorities have adopted rules that allow 

use of the countercyclical capital buffer, but other time-varying tools are limited in the United States.  This 

issue is discussed in, for example, Stanley Fischer (2015), “Macroprudential Policy in the U.S. Economy,” 

speech delivered at “Macroprudential Monetary Policy,” 59th Economic Conference of the Federal Reserve 

Bank of Boston, Boston, October 2, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20151002a.htm. 
14 For example, the FSOC contributed, through its identification process, to the development of the 

Securities and Exchange Commission reforms affecting money market funds.  The FSOC has also

The Financial System Is Safer 

The evidence shows that reforms since the crisis have made the financial system 

substantially safer.  Loss-absorbing capacity among the largest banks is significantly 

higher, with Tier 1 common equity capital more than doubling from early 2009 to now.15  

The annual stress-testing exercises in recent years have led to improvements in the capital 

positions and risk-management processes among participating banks.  Large banks have 

cut their reliance on short-term wholesale funding essentially in half and hold 

significantly more high-quality, liquid assets.  Assets under management at prime 

institutional money market funds that proved susceptible to runs in the crisis have 

decreased substantially.  And the ability of regulators to resolve a large institution has 

improved, reflecting both new authorities and tangible steps taken by institutions to 

adjust their organizational and capital structure in a manner that enhances their 

resolvability and significantly reduces the problem of too-big-to-fail. 

The progress evident in regulatory and supervisory metrics has been accompanied 

by shifts in private-sector assessments that also suggest enhanced financial stability.  

Investors have recognized the progress achieved toward ending too-big-to-fail, and 

several rating agencies have removed the government support rating uplift that they once 

accorded to the largest banks.  Credit default swaps for the large banks also suggest that 

                                                 
designated four firms as systemically important--AIG, GE Capital, Prudential, and MetLife.  GE Capital 

chose to shrink, adjust its business model, and reduce its footprint in short-term wholesale funding 

markets--and hence reduce a source of systemic risk.  These actions caused the FSOC to subsequently 

remove its designation as systemically important last year--illustrating how the designation process allows 

both identifying systemic firms and removing such designations when appropriate.   
15 The increase in Tier 1 common equity among bank holding companies has been sizable, especially for 

the largest banks.  If the largest banks are defined as either the eight U.S. global systemically important 

banks or the U.S. bank holding companies that participated in the CCAR in 2017 (and for which data are 

available for 2009:Q1), Tier 1 common equity has more than doubled in dollar terms and relative to risk-

weighted assets from the first quarter of 2009 to the most recent observations. 


 - 12 - 

market participants assign a low probability to the distress of a large U.S. banking firm.  

Market-based assessments of the loss-absorbing capacity of large U.S. banks have moved 

up in recent years, and market-based measures of equity now lie in the range of book 

estimates of equity.  To be sure, market-based measures may not reflect true risks--they 

certainly did not in the mid-2000s--and hence the observed improvements should not be 

overemphasized.16  But supervisory metrics are not perfect, either, and policymakers and 

investors should continue to monitor a range of supervisory and market-based indicators 

of financial system resilience.   

Economic research provides further support for the notion that reforms have made 

the system safer.  Studies have demonstrated that higher levels of bank capital mitigate 

the risk and adverse effects of financial crises.17  Moreover, researchers have highlighted 

how liquidity regulation supports financial stability by complementing capital 

                                                 
16 For example, Natasha Sarin and Lawrence Summers have reviewed market-based measures of bank 

equity and related measures of bank risks and concluded that such measures have not improved since the 

mid-2000s.  This assessment may understate the improvement in fundamental risk within the banking 

sector, as it takes the elevated valuations and low assessment of default risk implied by market prices 

during the earlier period as indicative of fundamentals.  Despite these shortcomings, their analysis is a 

useful reminder of the importance of considering both regulatory metrics and assessments implied by 

market prices.  See Natasha Sarin and Lawrence H. Summers (2016), “Understanding Bank Risk through 

Market Measures,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 57-109, 

https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sarintextfall16bpea.pdf. 
17 For example, see the review of evidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An 

Empirical Economic Assessment of the Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US,” Finance and 

Economics Discussion Series 2017-034 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 

April), https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/feds/files/2017034pap.pdf.  Some research is less 

supportive of the role of bank capital in limiting the risk of financial crises but suggests that higher levels of 

bank capital limit the economic costs of a financial crisis (for example, Òscar Jordà, Björn Richter, Moritz 

Schularick, and Alan M. Taylor (2017), “Bank Capital Redux:  Solvency, Liquidity, and Crisis,” NBER 

Working Paper Series 23287 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, March)).  Some 

of the differences in findings across studies may be due to the degree to which the studies incorporate data 

from different countries and over different periods, as researchers disagree over the extent to which 

comparisons across countries or periods appropriately account for other factors that differ across such 

dimensions.

regulation.18  Economic models of the resilience of the financial sector--so called top-

down stress-testing models--reinforce the message from supervisory stress tests that the 

riskiness of large banks has diminished over the past decade.19  Similarly, model-based 

analyses indicate that the risk of adverse fire sale spillovers across banks or broker-

dealers have been substantially mitigated.20 

Is This Safer System Supporting Growth? 

I suspect many in this audience would agree with the narrative of my remarks so 

far:  The events of the crisis demanded action, needed reforms were implemented, and 

these reforms have made the system safer.  Now--a decade from the onset of the crisis 

and nearly seven years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and international 

agreement on the key banking reforms--a new question is being asked:  Have reforms 

gone too far, resulting in a financial system that is too burdened to support prudent risk-

taking and economic growth? 

The Federal Reserve is committed individually, and in coordination with other 

U.S. government agencies through forums such as the FSOC and internationally through 

bodies such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the FSB, to evaluating

the effects of financial market regulations and considering appropriate adjustments.  

Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has independently taken steps to evaluate potential 

adjustments to its regulatory and supervisory practices.  For example, the Federal Reserve 

initiated a review of its stress tests following the 2015 cycle, and this review suggested 

changes to reduce the burden on participating institutions, especially smaller institutions, 

and to better align the supervisory stress tests with regulatory capital requirements.21  In 

addition, a broader set of changes to the new financial regulatory framework may deserve 

consideration.  Such changes include adjustments that may simplify regulations applying 

to small and medium-sized banks and enhance resolution planning.22 

More broadly, we continue to monitor economic conditions, and to review and 

conduct research, to better understand the effect of regulatory reforms and possible 

implications for regulation.  I will briefly summarize the current state of play in two 

areas:  the effect of regulation on credit availability and on changes in market liquidity. 

                                                 
21 In response to the Federal Reserve’s review and other information, the Board finalized a rule adjusting its 

capital plan and stress-testing rules, effective for the 2017 cycle, on January 30, 2017.  The final rule 

removes large and noncomplex firms from the qualitative assessment of the Federal Reserve’s CCAR, 

reducing significant burden on these firms and focusing the qualitative review in CCAR on the largest, 

most complex financial institutions.  More generally, changes to improve regulatory and supervisory 

practices related to stress testing by reducing unnecessary burden while preserving resilience are under 

consideration.  Possible changes have been discussed in Daniel K. Tarullo (2016), “Next Steps in the 

Evolution of Stress Testing,” speech delivered at the Yale University School of Management Leaders 

Forum, New Haven, Conn., September 26, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20160926a.htm. 
22 An overview of a set of principles that may guide such adjustments is discussed by Jerome H. Powell 

(2017), “Relationship between Regulation and Economic Growth,” statement before the Committee on 

Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, June 22, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/powell20170622a.htm.  In addition, the Federal 

Reserve Board has continued to engage in international efforts to assess the effects of reforms and possible 

adjustments; in this context, the FSB has developed a framework for the post-implementation evaluation of 

the effects of the Group of Twenty financial regulatory reforms; see Financial Stability Board (2017), 

Framework for Post-Implementation Evaluation of the Effects of the G20 Financial Regulatory Reforms

The effects of capital regulation on credit availability have been investigated 

extensively.  Some studies suggest that higher capital weighs on banks’ lending, while 

others suggest that higher capital supports lending.23  Such conflicting results in academic 

research are not altogether surprising.  It is difficult to identify the effects of regulatory 

capital requirements on lending because material changes to capital requirements are rare 

and are often precipitated, as in the recent case, by financial crises that also have large 

effects on lending. 

Given the uncertainty regarding the effect of capital regulation on lending, 

rulemakings of the Federal Reserve and other agencies were informed by analyses that 

balanced the possible stability gains from greater loss-absorbing capacity against the 

possible adverse effects on lending and economic growth.24  This ex ante assessment 

pointed to sizable net benefits to economic growth from higher capital standards--and 

subsequent research supports this assessment.25  The steps to improve the capital

sizable negative relationship between capital requirements and lending includes Shekhar Aiyar, Charles W. 

Calomiris, and Tomasz Wieladek (2014), “Does Macro-Prudential Regulation Leak?  Evidence from a UK 

Policy Experiment,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 46 (s1; February), pp. 181-214.  Research 

finding little relationship between lending and capital ratios (outside financial crises) includes Mark 

Carlson, Hui Shan, and Missaka Warusawitharana (2013), “Capital Ratios and Bank Lending:  A Matched 

Bank Approach,” Journal of Financial Intermediation, vol. 22 (October), pp. 663-87.  Research suggesting 

that higher capital levels may increase lending includes Leonardo Gambacorta and Hyun Song Shin (2016),

International Settlements, April), www.bis.org/publ/work558.pdf.

positions of banks promptly and significantly following the crisis, beginning with the 

2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, have resulted in a return of lending 

growth and profitability among U.S. banks more quickly than among their global peers. 

While material adverse effects of capital regulation on broad measures of lending 

are not readily apparent, credit may be less available to some borrowers, especially 

homebuyers with less-than-perfect credit histories and, perhaps, small businesses.  In 

retrospect, mortgage borrowing was clearly too easy for some households in the mid-

2000s, resulting in debt burdens that were unsustainable and ultimately damaging to the 

financial system.  Currently, many factors are likely affecting mortgage lending, 

including changes in market perceptions of the risk associated with mortgage lending; 

changes in practices at the government-sponsored enterprises and the Federal Housing 

Administration; changes in technology that may be contributing to entry by nonbank 

lenders; changes in consumer protection regulations; and, perhaps to a limited degree, 

changes in capital and liquidity regulations within the banking sector.  These issues are 

complex and interact with a broader set of challenges related to the domestic housing 

finance system.

and Juliane Begenau (2016), “Capital Requirements, Risk Choice, and Liquidity Provision in a Business 

Cycle Model,” unpublished paper, Harvard Business School, September.  Subsequent analyses, albeit ones 

that follow similar approaches, also suggest that there are net benefits to higher capital standards.  One 

example is the analysis by Firestone, Lorenc, and Ranish, “An Empirical Economic Assessment,” in 

note 17.  Another is Ingo Fender and Ulf Lewrick (2016), “Adding It All Up:  The Macroeconomic Impact 

of Basel III and Outstanding Reform Issues,” BIS Working Papers 591 (Basel, Switzerland:  Bank for 

International Settlements, November), www.bis.org/publ/work591.pdf.  Indeed, this research points to 

benefits from capital requirements in excess of those adopted, a conclusion also reached in Wayne 

Passmore and Alexander H. von Hafften (2017), “Are Basel’s Capital Surcharges for Global Systemically 

Important Banks Too Small?” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-021 (Washington:  Board of 

Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February),

Credit appears broadly available to small businesses with solid credit histories, 

although indicators point to some difficulties facing firms with weak credit scores and 

insufficient credit histories.26  Small business formation is critical to economic dynamism 

and growth.  Smaller firms rely disproportionately on lending from smaller banks, and 

the Federal Reserve has been taking steps and examining additional steps to reduce 

unnecessary complexity in regulations affecting smaller banks.27 

Finally, many financial market participants have expressed concerns about the 

ability to transact in volume at low cost--that is, about market liquidity, particularly in 

certain fixed-income markets such as that for corporate bonds.  Market liquidity for 

corporate bonds remains robust overall, and the healthy condition of the market is 

apparent in low bid-ask spreads and the large volume of corporate bond issuance in 

recent years.  That said, liquidity conditions are clearly evolving.  Large dealers appear to 

devote less of their balance sheets to holding inventories of securities to facilitate trades 

and instead increasingly facilitate trades by directly matching buyers and sellers.  In 

                                                 
26 This conclusion is consistent with, for example, the findings in Federal Reserve Banks (2017), 2016 

Small Business Credit Survey:  Report on Employer Firms (New York:  Federal Reserve Bank of New 

York, April), https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/smallbusiness/2016/SBCS-Report-

EmployerFirms-2016.pdf.  
27  As I have discussed previously, the Federal Reserve has been considering improvements through a 

number of work streams.  For example, the Federal Reserve and the other banking agencies have recently 

completed the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review.  Under 

EGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint review of their regulations every 

10 years to identify provisions that are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.  The Federal Reserve 

viewed this review as a timely opportunity to step back and identify ways to reduce regulatory burden, 

particularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the U.S. financial system.  I discussed 

preliminary emerging themes from this review in Janet L. Yellen (2016), “Supervision and Regulation,” 

statement before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives, September 28, 

https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/yellen20160928a.htm.  For the final EGRPRA 

report to the Congress, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Office of the Comptroller of 

the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and National Credit Union Administration (2017),

addition, algorithmic traders and institutional investors are a larger presence in various 

markets than previously, and the willingness of these institutions to support liquidity in 

stressful conditions is uncertain.  While no single factor appears to be the predominant 

cause of the evolution of market liquidity, some regulations may be affecting market 

liquidity somewhat.  There may be benefits to simplifying aspects of the Volcker rule, 

which limits proprietary trading by banking firms, and to reviewing the interaction of the 

enhanced supplementary leverage ratio with risk-based capital requirements.  At the same 

time, the new regulatory framework overall has made dealers more resilient to shocks, 

and, in the past, distress at dealers following adverse shocks has been an important factor 

driving market illiquidity.  As a result, any adjustments to the regulatory framework 

should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience at large dealers and banks 

associated with the reforms put in place in recent years.   

Remaining Challenges 

So where do we stand a decade after the onset of the most severe financial crisis 

since the Great Depression?  Substantial progress has been made toward the Federal 

Reserve’s economic objectives of maximum employment and price stability, in putting in 

place a regulatory and supervisory structure that is well designed to lower the risks to 

financial stability, and in actually achieving a stronger financial system.  Our more 

resilient financial system is better prepared to absorb, rather than amplify, adverse 

shocks, as has been illustrated during periods of market turbulence in recent years.  

Enhanced resilience supports the ability of banks and other financial institutions to lend, 

thereby supporting economic growth through good times and bad.

Nonetheless, there is more work to do.  The balance of research suggests that the 

core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly 

limiting credit availability or economic growth.  But many reforms have been 

implemented only fairly recently, markets continue to adjust, and research remains 

limited.  The Federal Reserve is committed to evaluating where reforms are working and 

where improvements are needed to most efficiently maintain a resilient financial system.   

Moreover, I expect that the evolution of the financial system in response to global 

economic forces, technology, and, yes, regulation will result sooner or later in the all-too-

familiar risks of excessive optimism, leverage, and maturity transformation reemerging in 

new ways that require policy responses.  We relearned this lesson through the pain 

inflicted by the crisis.  We can never be sure that new crises will not occur, but if we keep 

this lesson fresh in our memories--along with the painful cost that was exacted by the 

recent crisis--and act accordingly, we have reason to hope that the financial system and 

economy will experience fewer crises and recover from any future crisis more quickly, 

sparing households and businesses some of the pain they endured during the crisis that 

struck a decade ago.
