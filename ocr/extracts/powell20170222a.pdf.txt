Thank you for this invitation to speak here today.  I will begin by taking stock of 

the progress of the U.S. economy.  I will then discuss longer-term challenges for the 

economy and wrap up with a discussion of monetary policy.  As usual, my comments 

reflect my own views and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC). 

The Current State of the Economy 

The Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable prices and 

maximum employment--the dual mandate.  The FOMC has set a longer-term price 

stability objective of 2 percent annual inflation, as measured by the PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) price index.1  This is a symmetric objective, meaning that the 

Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below 2 

percent.  Until early last year, inflation was running substantially below our 2 percent 

objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices during late 2014 and early 2015.  

However, because prices of energy and food commodities are often volatile, a core 

measure that excludes these components provides a better indication of where overall 

inflation is headed.  While core inflation has also run consistently below 2 percent in 

recent years, it has been gradually rising, with the most recent 12-month reading at 1.7 

percent, three-tenths higher than a year ago (the black line in figure 1).  Market-based 

measures of inflation compensation have moved well above their lows of mid-2016 but 

remain below pre-crisis levels, and survey measures have stayed relatively well anchored.  

Overall, inflation seems to be on track to reach the 2 percent objective over the next

Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2017), Monetary Policy Report (Washington:  Board of 
Governors, February), https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20170214_mprfullreport.pdf.

couple of years.  Although inflation is currently below our objective, core inflation has 

generally been close to 2 percent over the past 20 years.  This outcome reflects the 

success of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations. 

Many indicators show that we have also made significant progress toward 

maximum employment.  Since 2010, payroll employment has increased by almost 16 

million jobs, and the unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent to 4.8 percent--in line 

with most estimates of the longer-run normal level (or natural rate) of unemployment and 

with the median estimate by FOMC participants in the December 2016 Summary of 

Economic Projections (SEP).  Accordingly, the red line in the figure indicates that the 

unemployment rate gap has essentially been closed.2 

 A variety of other measures also suggest that we are close to maximum 

employment.  Surveys of household sentiment about the availability of jobs and of 

business sentiment regarding the difficulty of filling jobs have now reached levels seen in 

prior periods of full employment.  Moreover, although the pace of wage increases is 

slower than during pre-crisis periods of full employment, wages have been increasing 

faster than both output per hour (productivity) and inflation, and labor’s share of income 

has begun to move up after a long decline. 

All in all, we appear to be close to our employment objective, and are nearing our 

inflation objective.  While the pace of progress has at times been frustratingly slow, this 

outcome is a better one than that achieved by most other advanced economies.  Even so, 

it is worth remembering that the current and future states of the economy are always

rate for 2017 is 4.7 percent.

uncertain, and today is no exception.  Our discussions of the economy may sometimes 

ring in the ears of the public with more certainty than is appropriate.  Take the concept of 

“maximum employment,” which requires an estimate of both the natural rate of 

unemployment for those who are in the labor force and the sustainable level of labor 

force participation.3  The natural rate of unemployment is not directly observed, and the 

record suggests that it could be materially lower or higher than current estimates.4  There 

is also uncertainty about the underlying trend level of labor force participation.  

Participation has been declining since about 2000 because of the aging of our population 

and other secular trends, and analysts generally agree that participation will continue to 

decline over time for these reasons (figure 2).  A canonical paper by a group of Fed 

economists estimates a trend rate of decline of about 0.3 percentage point per year.5  

After declining sharply and dipping well below the prior trend in the years following the 

crisis, participation has been roughly flat since late 2013.  Relative to this estimate of the 

declining trend, three years of flat participation implies a cyclical improvement of 

roughly 1 percentage point.  But there is a range of views on the underlying trend and 

whether we can expect a bit more near-term cyclical improvement in participation.  The 

                                                 
3 The labor force is made up of people who have jobs as well as people who are jobless but are looking for 
a job and are available to work. See Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Labor Force Participation,” webpage, 
https://www.bls.gov/bls/cps_fact_sheets/lfp_mock.htm (accessed February 17, 2017). 
4 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite 
wide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification as well as uncertainty about the 
parameter estimates given the model.  The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 
95 percent confidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate.  See Douglas 
Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of 
Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and 
Strategy (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).

Congressional Budget Office estimates that participation is currently 0.7 percentage point 

below its trend rate, which suggests remaining upside potential.  By contrast, other recent 

work does not find a strong case for a meaningful further slack.6  The issue has important 

implications, since changes in participation can have material effects on the 

unemployment rate:  Holding the level of employment constant, a 25 basis point change 

in the participation rate would lead roughly to a corresponding 40 basis point change in 

the unemployment rate. 

Longer-Run Issues 

Productivity and growth 

Our economy is strong and operating near its capacity.  But we face important 

challenges when it comes to the longer-term growth rate of the economy.  Long-term 

economic growth depends mainly on nonmonetary factors such as population growth and 

workforce participation, the skills and aptitudes of our workforce, the tools at their 

disposal, and the pace of technological advance.  Fiscal and regulatory policies can have 

important effects on these factors.  The main long-run contribution monetary policy can 

make is to provide a stable macroeconomic and financial environment.  The level of 

potential growth does have important implications for monetary policy. 

One of the surprising features of this expansion has been that 2 percent growth in 

real gross domestic product (GDP) has been enough to create solid job gains and 

unexpectedly large declines in unemployment.  During much of the recovery, forecasters

have been overly optimistic about growth but too pessimistic on job creation and the 

decline in the unemployment rate.  In 2007, the average expectation for long-run GDP 

growth from the Blue Chip survey of 50 forecasters was 2.9 percent (figure 3).  The 

consensus estimate has moved down steadily since then and is now at 2.1 percent.  Other 

forecasters have also lowered their estimates over time, including those sampled by the 

Survey of Professional Forecasters and, yes, FOMC participants.7  Yet, as this figure 

shows, unemployment has declined faster than expected. 

More than the expected number of workers have been required to produce less 

than the expected amount of output.  The implication is that trend productivity and, 

ultimately, potential growth are lower than expected.  The decline in estimates of 

potential growth has been driven largely by unexpectedly weak productivity growth.  

Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per year, on average, since 2011--the 

worst performance over such a period since World War II (figure 4).  As this figure 

shows, productivity growth moves around significantly over time and has averaged about 

2 percent since 1970.  One factor behind the decline since the financial crisis is the 

relatively slow increase in the capital stock per worker, as weak demand and uncertainty 

about the future have held back business investment.  But the more important factor has 

been the marked decline in total factor productivity (TFP), which represents the part of 

productivity that is not explained by capital increases or increases in the skills of the 

labor force.  TFP is thought to be mainly a function of technological innovation and 

                                                 
7 The history of longer-run forecasts for real GDP growth from the SEP is shown in figure 4 of Jerome H.

efficiency gains.  The decline in TFP growth has been widespread across advanced 

economies, suggesting that global trends are at play.8 

There is no consensus about the future direction of productivity growth.9  Some 

argue that the important paradigm-changing innovations are behind us, while others think 

that this slowdown is only a passing phase.  One thing on which all agree is that the 

future prospects for productivity growth and potential GDP are highly uncertain.  I hope 

there is also broad agreement on the need for policies that maximize potential growth and 

spread prosperity as widely as possible.  We need policies that encourage labor force 

participation and investment in education and training, in infrastructure, and in 

businesses. These policies are, of course, mostly outside the authority of the Federal 

Reserve. 

Low interest rates 

Another unanticipated feature of this recovery has been the low level of both 

short- and longer-term interest rates.  At 2.4 percent, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is 

far below levels typically seen before the financial crisis (figure 5).  Of course, Fed 

                                                 
8 There may also be a role for homegrown factors, such as the decrease in business dynamism.  See Jerome 
H. Powell (2016), “Recent Economic Developments, Monetary Policy Considerations, and Longer-Term 
Prospects,” speech delivered at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, Chicago, June 28, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160628a.htm.  The worldwide nature of the 
slowdown is documented in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2016), “New

(Chicago:  University of Chicago Press). 
9 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert J. Gordon (2016), The Rise and Fall of 
American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University 
Press).  Among the optimists are Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age:  
Work, Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (New York:  W.W. Norton &

policy is a factor in holding down longer-term yields.  But longer-term rates have been 

declining for more than 30 years, for several reasons.  Much of the decline is due to 

significantly lower long-term expectations of inflation, as well as reduced term 

premiums, likely reflecting both lower inflation risk and the fact that, with anchored 

inflation expectations, nominal bonds have become an attractive hedge against market 

risk.  Regulatory changes have raised demand for safe assets.  Lower potential growth 

implies lower returns and therefore lower rates.  Changes in savings and investment 

demand owing to demographics and other factors have put downward pressure on yields 

as well. 

As a result, the real federal funds rate that is neither contractionary nor 

expansionary when the economy is operating near its potential--the so-called neutral real 

rate or r*--has declined significantly.  We cannot directly observe the neutral rate but can 

only infer it from the evolution of the economy--it “is seen by its works.”10  The neutral 

rate changes significantly over time, and estimates of its level entail substantial 

uncertainty.11  Before the crisis, the longer-run neutral real rate was generally thought to 

be roughly stable at around 2.25 percent.  Since the crisis, estimates have declined 

steadily.  For example, the median estimate implied by FOMC participants stood at 1.0 

percent in the December 2016 SEP.  Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even

lower than that today and will only return to its longer-run value over time.12  One 

important implication is that today’s low rates are not as stimulative as they may seem--

consider that, despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below target. 

Monetary Policy amid Uncertainty 

 I’d like to turn now to monetary policy.  I expect the economy to continue 

broadly along its current path, which implies further labor market tightening and inflation 

edging closer to 2 percent.  On this path, unemployment would decline modestly below 

current estimates of the natural rate and remain there for some time.  I see that as a 

desirable outcome and do not see data suggesting that we are behind the curve.  In recent 

years, the economy has faced significant downside risks, particularly from weak global 

conditions.  The Committee has been quite patient, and I believe that has served us well.  

But risks now seems to me to be more in balance.  Going forward, I see it as appropriate 

to gradually tighten policy as long as the economy continues to behave roughly as 

expected.  As always, the actual path could be faster or slower than expected and will 

depend on developments in the economy. 

Before concluding, I would like to turn briefly to a discussion of how policy 

decisions are made, including the role of simple monetary policy rules.  Since the 1990s, 

central banks have grown ever more communicative about their monetary policy

decisions.  A central tenet that underlies this increase in transparency is that monetary 

policy is more effective when the public understands how the central bank will respond to 

changing conditions, and can calibrate expectations accordingly.13  That means that the 

Committee must have a clearly communicated, systematic way of responding to changes 

in economic conditions and the outlook.  In that spirit, the FOMC takes a forward-

looking approach to policymaking, whereby each policy decision the FOMC makes is 

grounded not just in current assessments of the economy but also in expectations for how 

the economy will evolve relative to our goals.  Individual participants develop their own 

forecasts of the economy’s evolution.  The Committee then makes a collective decision, 

embodied in the postmeeting statement, setting monetary policy to achieve those goals.14  

Over time, incoming information and shocks to the economy inevitably alter views of the 

appropriate path for monetary policy.  One way of seeing this is through the SEP 

forecasts of individual FOMC participants.  These forecasts tend to converge over time to 

the Committee’s 2 percent inflation objective and to each individual’s interpretation of 

maximum employment, because each individual explicitly writes down a path for policy 

that is intended to achieve those outcomes.  Accordingly, revisions to the projections tend

to show up in the path for the federal funds rate that each individual sees as appropriate to 

achieve those objectives.15 

In preparing for FOMC meetings, policymakers routinely review alternative 

policy paths prescribed by several simple policy rules that are in wide usage.16  Decades 

of research have produced many variations of these rules, which are typically derived 

from differing but valid insights and which yield different rate paths.  For example, 

economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland regularly update on the Bank’s 

website an analysis of seven different rules and their prescriptions.17 

A good way to see the range of possibilities is through a generalized form of a 

Taylor-type rule (figure 6).18  As you can see, this rule is based on key factors for 

monetary policy, such as the neutral real rate of interest, or r*, and deviations of inflation 

and output or unemployment from their longer-run values.  While these are often called 

“simple” rules, application of a rule requires a significant number of important choices.  

It is necessary to pick a value or a path for r*.  The rule also calls for an estimate of the 

output or unemployment rate gap.  There is particularly high uncertainty about measuring 

the deviation of output from its potential; our real-time estimates of this gap are often 

                                                 
15 The SEP is not a “consensus” forecast of the Committee, and the interest rate projections in the SEP are 
each individual participant’s assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Thus, the Committee’s forward-
looking approach to policymaking is not the same as the forecast-targeting approach advocated by 
Svensson (2005) and others.  See Lars E.O. Svensson (2005), “Monetary Policy with Judgment:  Forecast 
Targeting,” International Journal of Central Banking, vol. 1 (June), pp. 1-54.

Fischer (2017), “I’d Rather Have Bob Solow Than an Econometric Model, But . . . ,” speech delivered at

revised substantially in hindsight.  To reduce that uncertainty, we often use the 

unemployment gap rather than the output gap in these rules.19  We also need to pick 

values for the coefficients a and b, whether they are the values John Taylor posited in his 

seminal 1993 article or other values from the vast literature that has come since.20 

There are still other choices to make.  Traditional policy rules are backward 

looking in the sense that they use available data about inflation and output.  But monetary 

policy needs to be forward looking, as I discussed, and there are rules that rely on 

forecasts of inflation and output.  Finally, many have advanced the view that, when times 

are particularly uncertain, monetary policy should react cautiously to incoming 

information.21  That insight leads to rules that incorporate inertia, thereby slowing down 

the movement of rates over time.  Each of these insights has some validity, and each has 

important implications for the prescriptions of a policy rule. 

                                                 
19 In general, the unemployment rate is more informative of the state of the business cycle than GDP 
because of the difficulties in estimating potential output.  See Charles A. Fleischman and John M. Roberts

Review, vol. 57 (May), pp. 411-25.  In discussing the effects of uncertainty on monetary policy, Blinder

move . . . and then do less.”  See Alan S. Blinder (1998), Central Banking in Theory and Practice

by committee; see Clare Lombardelli, James Proudman, and James Talbot (2005), “Committees versus

Figure 7 shows the prescriptions of three simple policy rules since 2000.22  While 

the rules often diverged, all of them called for a substantial reduction in the federal funds 

rate around the time of the financial crisis, and all of them prescribed easing well below 

the effective lower bound (ELB).23  Faced with the impossibility of providing more 

accommodation at the ELB through deeply negative policy rates, the Committee turned 

instead to two unconventional monetary policy tools--large-scale securities purchases and 

forward guidance. 

Figure 8 shows the Taylor (1993) rule for different values of r* layered over the 

“dots” from the December 2016 SEP, with a black horizontal line at the median value for 

each year.24  The red solid line shows the rule prescriptions when the intercept is set 

equal to 2 percent, as in Taylor’s original formulation.  If we replace that intercept with 

the median of the longer-run r* from the December 2016 SEP, which is 1 percent (the 

blue dashed line), we see that the rule prescribes policy interest rates lower than the 

unadjusted rule.  However, many observers believe that the neutral real interest rate is 

currently well below its longer-run value.  The language that has appeared in the 

Committee’s postmeeting statement since December 2015 that “the federal funds rate is 

likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer 

                                                 
22 These are static simulations and do not incorporate feedback from the policy rule to real activity or 
inflation. 
23 Ben Bernanke finds that a “balanced approach” rule estimated using real-time data closely tracks the 
federal funds rate from 1996 through 2008.  See Ben S. Bernanke (2015), “The Taylor Rule:  A Benchmark 
for Monetary Policy?” Ben Bernanke’s Blog, April 28, https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-
bernanke/2015/04/28/the-taylor-rule-a-benchmark-for-monetary-policy. 
24 Figure 2 of the SEP provides each individual FOMC participant’s assessment of “appropriate monetary 
policy” in the form of a dot plot.  “Appropriate monetary policy” is defined as the future path of policy that 
each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy 
his or her individual interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price 
stability.  The policy prescriptions are derived using the median projections for core PCE price inflation, 
the unemployment rate, and the longer-run normal unemployment rate from the December 2016 SEP.

run” is consistent with this view.  Some estimates put the current value of r* close to 

zero, which leads to the purple dashed-dotted line in figure 8.25 

Figure 9 provides prescriptions from the policy rules shown in figure 7 that vary 

along dimensions other than the neutral real rate.  The first-difference rule shown by the 

purple dashed-dotted line incorporates forecasts by prescribing changes to the federal 

funds rate based on projected inflation relative to its objective and the projected change in 

the output gap.26  The insight behind this rule is that it does not require estimates of the 

neutral real rate or the level of the output gap.27  The green dashed line shows the policy 

prescription from an inertial version of the “balanced approach” rule with an intercept of 

1 percent, which includes a lagged value of the nominal interest rate.28  This rule does 

not go as far as the first-difference rule in eliminating the level of r* from the policy 

prescription, but it does prescribe that policy move only slowly toward its longer-run 

level, which places less weight in the short-run on the estimate of r*.  This rule 

                                                 
25 See Kathryn Holston, Thomas Laubach, and John C. Williams (2016), “Measuring the Natural Rate of 
Interest:  International Trends and Determinants,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2016-073 
(Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, September), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016073pap.pdf. 
26 Orphanides (2003) proposed a rule that sets changes in the nominal interest rate equal to deviations in 
nominal income growth relative to target, ΔR = β [ (π + Δy)  ̶  (π* + Δy*) ], where y is real GDP.  The 
forecast-based version employed here substitutes the change in the unemployment gap for the change in the 
output gap (using an Okun’s law coefficient of 2) and sets β to 0.5, yielding ΔR = 0.5 (π    ̶ π*)  ̶  Δu.  When 
implemented using forecasts, inflation is the 4-quarter inflation rate 3 quarters ahead, and Δu is the 4-
quarter change in the unemployment rate 3 quarters ahead.  See Athanasios Orphanides (2003), “Historical 
Monetary Policy Analysis and the Taylor Rule,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 50 (July), pp. 983-
1022. 
27 While the natural rate of interest may be changing over time and the first-difference rule does not take 
these changes into account, Orphanides and Williams (2007) argue that rules like the first-difference rule 
can deliver good economic performance even when there is uncertainty about those changes.  See 
Athanasios Orphanides and John C. Williams (2007), “Robust Monetary Policy with Imperfect 
Knowledge,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 54 (July), pp. 1406-35. 
28 Chair Yellen has called this rule the “balanced-approach” rule.  See Janet L. Yellen (2012), “Perspectives 
on Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at the Boston Economic Club Dinner, Boston, June 6, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20120606a.htm.  This rule has also been 
considered by others.  For example, see John B. Taylor (1999), “A Historical Analysis of Monetary Policy 
Rules,” in John B. Taylor, ed., Monetary Policy Rules (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press), p. 319-341.

prescription is closer to FOMC participants’ assessments of appropriate monetary policy.  

Although many FOMC participants believe that r* has fallen, they also believe that it will 

rise toward a longer-term level of 1 percent over time, and the better fit of the inertial rule 

in part captures this assessment. 

I would offer several takeaways from this overview.  There is general agreement 

that these simple policy rules do provide interesting and useful insights into policy.  To 

gain the benefit of those insights, it is helpful to look at a range of rules.  But there is no 

consensus that any one rule is best, let alone that it would be desirable to require the 

FOMC to pick and mechanically follow one rule to the exclusion of others.29 

Simple rules also leave out critical considerations for the path of policy.  One 

such consideration of great importance is that, with the secular decline in interest rates 

over the past 35 years, policy is now far more likely to hit the ELB than had been 

thought, which may present severe challenges.  Research suggests that, as a precautionary 

matter, policy should be more aggressive in providing accommodation as rates move 

closer to the ELB.30  But there is no consensus today on whether or how to incorporate 

ELB-related risks into a simple policy rule of the type that I have discussed here.  

Another such consideration is that simple policy rules include no consideration of 

financial stability.  But monetary policy may sometimes face tradeoffs between 

macroeconomic objectives and financial stability.  Recent business cycles show that 

                                                 
29 Eisenhardt and Sull proposed the use of simple rules by corporations.  See Kathleen M. Eisenhardt and 
Donald Sull (2001), “Strategy as Simple Rules,” Harvard Business Review, January, 
https://hbr.org/2001/01/strategy-as-simple-rules.  Among the companies they site positively as having 
employed simple rules were Enron, AOL, and Yahoo. 
30 See Charles Evans, Jonas Fisher, Francois Gourio, and Spencer Krane (2015), “Risk Management for 
Monetary Policy Near the Zero Lower Bound,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, BPEA Conference 
Draft, March 19-20, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/2015a_evans.pdf.

instability can emerge when inflation is under control.  Some have argued for inclusion of 

a financial stability term into policy rules, but the issue is far from settled.31 

To conclude, I think it’s fair to say that simple policy rules are widely thought to 

be both interesting and useful, but to represent only a small part of the analysis needed to 

assess the appropriate path for policy.  I am unable to think of any critical, complex 

human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation.  In particular, 

no major central bank uses policy rules in a prescriptive way, and it is hard to predict the 

consequences of requiring the FOMC to do so, as some have proposed.  Policy should be 

systematic, but not automatic.
