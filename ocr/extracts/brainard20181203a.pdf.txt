December 3, 2018 
 



I am pleased to join the fourth annual conference on the evolving structure of the 

U.S. Treasury market.  Four years ago, the Treasury “flash rally” served as a wake-up 

call for regulators and market participants alike that the structure of the Treasury market 

had changed radically from the conventional view.  Since the surprising sharp spike in 

Treasury prices on October 15, 2014, the public sector has devoted significant effort and 

resources to monitoring the ongoing changes in the Treasury market.  The interagency 

working group’s (IAWG) Joint Staff Report on the events of October 15, the Treasury 

Department’s request for information on the report’s recommendations, and the 

subsequent collection of transactions data by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority 

(FINRA) through its Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) system have 

offered us a much better understanding of this market.1   

But the market is not resting, and neither can we.  Even in the past year, much has 

changed in the Treasury market, and technology is continuing to drive rapid 

transformation in the competitive landscape.  I would like to talk about the changes we 

are seeing, what we are learning from the TRACE data, and emerging developments that 

are important to monitor.  In particular, I want to highlight an initiative that the Federal 

Reserve is considering to expand the public sector’s access to transactions data in order to 

help ensure the IAWG is able to keep up with the market.

of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.

Still Changing 

At the first Treasury conference in 2015, market participants were still processing 

the results of the Joint Staff Report.2  It came as a surprise to many that the high-

frequency trading activity conducted by “proprietary trading firms,” or PTFs, accounted 

for a majority of trading in the interdealer platforms that are so central to the Treasury 

market.  Indeed, the names of the largest proprietary trading firms were new even to 

some seasoned professionals.  At that time, the discussion often drew a very bright line 

between traditional dealers and proprietary trading firms and, in particular, the trading 

activities associated with each. 

The distinction between broker-dealers and proprietary trading firms remains 

important today with regard to why they are trading, but less and less with regard to how 

they are trading.  Now, as then, broker-dealers intermediate financial transactions 

primarily to serve their clients’ needs, and, for this reason, they are required to register 

with FINRA.  Conversely, the hallmark of proprietary trading firm activity was and still 

is high-frequency proprietary trading.  Proprietary trading firms trade for their own 

account rather than that of a client, which places them outside of FINRA’s jurisdiction 

and many other forms of oversight.  This distinction remains important today.   

But the distinction in how broker-dealers and proprietary trading firms trade was 

already starting to blur by the time of the first conference.  For example, some of the 

larger dealers had already invested heavily in electronic trading systems by 2015.  Since

that time, the distinctions have blurred considerably further.  Almost all midsize and large 

dealers now possess autoquoting capabilities and deploy them on Treasury trading 

platforms.  Several primary dealers have even entered direct partnerships with proprietary 

trading firms, effectively outsourcing some parts of their market-making operations.   

The evolution of the dealer business model to incorporate advanced technology is 

not limited only to trading activity.  A number of developers of emerging financial 

technologies, or fintech, have arisen in recent years to provide dealers and other market 

participants with back-office tools that reduce costs by automating routine processes, 

streamlining regulatory reporting, and more efficiently allocating capital, collateral, and 

margin among competing uses.  On the front end, dealers are increasingly offering their 

customers web-based research and analytic tools, trading and execution engines, and 

even apps that allow clients access to internal software for pricing and structuring 

transactions. 

The landscape for proprietary trading firms has changed considerably in recent 

years, too.  Since 2015, we have witnessed the first initial public offering by a proprietary 

trading firm, as well as a few high-profile mergers and acquisitions.3  The industry is 

contending with declining revenue growth and diminished returns by expanding 

operations into new asset classes and geographies.  Proprietary trading firms are also 

adapting in other ways.  Some have begun to offer broker-dealer services themselves or 

appear to be contemplating such a business model change.  Still others have entered joint 

                                                 
3 These developments include the mergers and acquisitions between Virtu and KCG and between Teza and 
Quantlab.  See CNBC (2017), “Trading Firm Virtu Financial to Buy KCG for about $1.4 Billion,” CNBC,

Times, March 21.

ventures with one another to finance new investment in faster microwave 

communications and defray the high costs of that infrastructure.4  Third-party providers 

are also offering high-speed links to firms that wish to engage in high-frequency trading 

without investing directly in microwave tower infrastructure.   

We have seen important recent changes among infrastructure providers as well.  

CME Group’s acquisition of NEX and the BrokerTec platform has recently been 

finalized, with direct implications for the structure of the Treasury market.5  We have 

also witnessed the conclusion of J.P. Morgan’s exit from broker-dealer settlement 

services in the triparty Treasury repo market and the transition to BNY Mellon 

Government Securities Services Corp. as a subsidiary offering Treasury market 

settlement services.  Beyond these changes, some new trading platforms are 

experimenting with the very structure of the market.6  These platforms are promoting 

new trading models such as all-to-all trading, in which many buy-side and sell-side 

participants transact directly, and direct streaming, in which live continuous, executable 

prices are delivered electronically under bilaterally or multilaterally negotiated terms.  

These services can potentially bridge all of the venues of the Treasury market, connecting 

not just dealers and proprietary trading firms, but also those entities with buy-side clients.   

And, finally, the macroeconomic landscape has undergone some significant 

changes that have important implications for the Treasury market.  At the time of the 

flash rally in October 2014, the Federal Reserve was still actively purchasing Treasury

securities, and the federal funds rate was still at the effective lower bound.  With the 

economy now at or beyond full employment and inflation around target, the Federal 

Open Market Committee has since gradually increased its target for the federal funds rate 

to between 2 and 2-1/4 percent, and normalization of the balance sheet is well under way.  

Since October 2017, the portfolio of the System Open Market Account has decreased in 

size from $4.2 trillion to about $3.9 trillion. 

What Have We Learned So Far? 

Against this changed backdrop and with more than a year’s worth of information 

from the TRACE data available, it is a good time to ask what we have learned since the 

initial market event and what questions remain.  First, the initiation of policy 

normalization and the ongoing reduction of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet do not 

appear to have sparked a deterioration in Treasury market liquidity.  Standard metrics 

such as bid-ask spreads have not materially changed for benchmark securities since 2014.  

Market functioning has also been orderly during a number of recent events that were 

characterized by high trading volume and elevated price volatility, such as in early 

February of this year. 

Second, some segments of the market seem much more active than observers may 

have feared before the collection of TRACE data.  In particular, according to the TRACE 

data as shown in figure 1, off-the-run trading accounts for 27 percent of overall trading 

volume, while deep off-the-run notes and bonds--seasoned securities older than the first 

or second off-the-run--account for 14 percent of all coupon activity.7  Likewise, the data

show that Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) trade in significant volumes as 

well.   

Due to the TRACE data, we are now able to measure with reasonable precision 

the transaction volumes in these securities.  Off-the-run and TIPS activity is largely 

concentrated in the dealer-to-client (DTC) and voice venues of the market, segments into 

which the public sector had only limited insight before the TRACE data.  While 

substantial analysis with respect to pricing and liquidity remains to be done in these 

market segments, the early results allow us to conclude that these securities do trade in 

meaningful amounts.  

Third, although there was speculation that proprietary trading firms had already 

eclipsed bank dealers in benchmark Treasury trading or would come to threaten the 

dealer business model more broadly, neither has occurred.8  Based on the TRACE data, 

as shown in figure 2, we can now state with a reasonable amount of confidence that 

dealers generally--and primary dealers particularly--still intermediate the majority of 

activity in all Treasury securities.9  In the market for Treasury bills in particular, primary 

dealers play an important role in allocating issuance to investors.  This can be seen where 

most activity in bills occurs, as shown in figure 3, which depicts the share of trading 

volume of bills in the DTC, interdealer broker (IDB), and interdealer segments of the 

                                                 
8 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York (2015), “Conference Summary:  The Evolving Structure of the 
U.S. Treasury Market (October 20-21, 2015),” 
https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/newsevents/events/markets/2015/Conference-
Summary.pdf. 
9 TRACE data do not currently identify PTF firms.  We estimate the activity by assuming PTFs account for 
92 percent of nondealer trading volume on the electronic and automated interdealer brokers, which is the 
share of nondealer activity accounted for by PTFs on electronic IDBs reported in the Joint Staff Report 
from 2014.  The Securities and Exchange Commission recently approved a rule change proposed by 
FINRA to require some reporters in TRACE to identify non-FINRA member activity.  Once in effect, this 
change will enhance regulators’ ability to identify trades with PTFs on IDBs and to more accurately 
identify the share of overall trading activity attributable to PTFs.

market.  Federal Reserve staff analysis of the TRACE data reveals that nearly three-

fourths of total trading volume of bills is in the DTC market, where dealers are, of course, 

the main intermediary.  From this and other analysis, there is substantial evidence that the 

dealer business model plays a central role in this market and will continue to do so into 

the future.10 

That said, proprietary trading firms do occupy an important space in the Treasury 

market alongside dealers, and it is clear that they, too, are here to stay.  When it comes to 

areas where speed is paramount--for instance, in trading across and between asset classes 

and trading venues--proprietary trading firms are deploying technology and infrastructure 

in ways that are having lasting effects.  This is evident in the Treasury market in the 

intervals following economic data releases.  Again turning to the TRACE data, we see in 

figure 4 a depiction of average trading volumes of all Treasury securities across five-

minute intervals on days in which the Employment Situation report, gross domestic 

product data, or consumer price index data are announced.  The TRACE volume data 

indicate that the immediate surge in trading activity following these announcements 

occurs mainly in the electronic IDB venue, where proprietary trading firms dominate. 

In short, the TRACE data are enabling us to put some old puzzles to rest.  Our 

analysis makes clear that the Treasury market has adapted well to the post-crisis 

regulatory regime, the normalization of monetary policy, and technological changes in 

trading processes, and that both broker-dealers and proprietary trading firms play 

important, often complementary, roles in the market structure that has emerged.

Looking Ahead 

Of course, the structure of the Treasury market will continue to evolve, along with 

changes in technology and the broader financial environment.  Looking forward, we will 

need to ask more of the data as we seek to understand what is next for the structure of the 

Treasury market.  As I mentioned earlier, experimentation with new protocols is 

occurring now.  Although all-to-all trading in the Treasury market was contemplated at 

the first conference, direct streaming largely was not, which might prompt us to ask what 

else is on the horizon.   

In addition to direct streaming, another development that bears watching is the 

batch auction platforms that have arisen in the voice IDB market, something that has not 

received as much attention from market participants.  Started after the financial crisis, 

batch auctions are now conducted by a number of IDB firms at regular intervals 

throughout the trading day.  Like any closed auction, the IDB collects anonymous bids 

and offers for a specific security in specific amounts during a relatively short window of 

time, generally on the order of a few minutes.  After the batch auction closes, the orders 

are matched, and participants are notified of their awards.11  Figure 5, based on TRACE 

data, depicts average trading volumes of TIPS securities in the IDB venue of the market 

across five-minute intervals.  As you can see, the level of activity rises significantly at 

intervals, which correspond to the timing of the auctions.  While it is not a large part of 

the overall market, this activity appears to be an important innovation for segments often 

deemed to be less liquid--in particular, for off-the-run and TIPS trading on voice IDBs.  

                                                 
11 Note that these auctions differ from proposed high-frequency batch auctions in that they are held at much 
less frequent intervals, typically separated by hours and, in some cases, occurring only once a day or a 
week. 


 - 9 - 

Before the collection of the TRACE data, there was limited insight into this area of the 

market, which made it difficult to assess the significance of such innovations.   

No doubt there are other innovations that have yet to be assessed.  Recently, the 

debate over liquidity has turned toward the participation of proprietary trading firms in 

the off-the-run segment of the market, an area outside of their traditional domain.  All-to-

all and direct-streaming platforms are also attempting to establish a foothold in the off-

the-run segment by offering new services.  I look forward to further analysis as the 

structure of the market continues to evolve. 

Keeping Up 

As the Treasury market has evolved, the public sector has had to evolve as well in 

order to keep up.  Many of the recommendations in the Joint Staff Report have now been 

implemented.  Our colleagues at Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and 

FINRA deserve credit for the work to begin collecting Treasury transaction data on 

FINRA’s TRACE system.  My hope is that you will take away from my remarks, along 

with those of my colleagues from other agencies, a comprehensive picture of how all of 

the IAWG agencies are using the data to work through the many issues that intersect with 

our various policy missions and mandates. 

As the market continues to innovate and the broader financial environment 

continues to shift, we will maintain our focus on the resilience of the Treasury market 

specifically and the financial system more broadly.12  In this regard, the staff at the 

Federal Reserve continues to work on important issues raised by the events of October 

                                                 
12 Flash events that have occurred in recent years include, but are not limited to, the first “flash crash” in 
U.S. equity markets on May 6, 2010; the Treasury flash rally of October 15, 2014, the flash event in U.S. 
equity markets on August 24, 2015; the pound flash crash on October 7, 2016; and the turbulence in U.S. 
equity and VIX markets on February 5, 2018.

15, 2014.  Markets have been able to weather several episodes of short-lived market 

turbulence well in the past few years.  But the fact that sharp market movements--some 

on the order of seven or eight standard deviations outside the norm--can occur even in the 

absence of clear news drivers remains a concern and highlights the potential risks to 

financial stability posed by the high-speed transmission of price and liquidity shocks 

across multiple markets and trading venues.   

The TRACE data now allow us to monitor events when equity and bond markets 

move sharply.  For instance, take the turbulence in equity and bond markets on February 

5, 2018.  While trading volumes in both the electronic IDB and DTC market segments 

were markedly higher than average, some metrics of liquidity, such as market depth near 

the top of the order book on major electronic IDB platforms, deteriorated and remained 

low through the week.  The pattern of a spike in trading volumes followed by a persistent 

decline in market depth has been characteristic of three recent market turmoil episodes:  

(1) the Treasury flash rally on October 15, 2014; (2) the flash crash in the British pound 

on October 7, 2016; and (3) the spike in the VIX on February 5, 2018.13 Figure 6 shows 

this pattern for February 5, 2018.  These seemingly contradictory dynamics are easier to 

reconcile if the prevalent role played by high-speed electronic trading in the Treasury 

market is taken into account, particularly under stressed conditions.  As previously noted 

in the Joint Staff Report, high-speed market makers are able to manage perceived risks 

from sudden adverse price moves by greatly reducing the sizes of orders placed on 

electronic execution venues while, at the same time, increasing order placement rates as

much as needed to accommodate increased trading volumes without the need to widen 

bid-ask spreads.   

That said, the ability of high-speed market makers to nearly simultaneously adjust 

liquidity provision across multiple closely linked markets can create potential challenges 

for large institutional investors seeking to reliably aggregate posted liquidity among 

otherwise distinct trading venues.14  The dynamic nature of liquidity provision by high-

speed market makers makes static measures of liquidity, such as posted bid-ask spreads 

and market depth, less useful.  For the purposes of improving our assessment of financial 

stability, it is therefore necessary to look for alternative ways of gauging liquidity and 

transaction costs in these markets.  For example, measures such as implementation 

shortfall aim to account directly for the difference between the original decision price and 

the final execution price for a trade split into multiple smaller transactions.15 As IAWG 

staff members continue to refine the TRACE data to assess market resilience more 

accurately in light of changes in structure and speed, it will be important to incorporate 

alternative measures of liquidity and transaction costs.  

Separately, the increased role of managed funds is also having an effect on the 

Treasury market.  TRACE data can help us keep up with that development as well.  As in 

other asset classes, 3 p.m. has become an important liquidity point during the trading day 

for Treasury securities.  There is a regular spike in trading activity around 3 p.m., as can 

be seen in figure 7, which depicts average trading volumes across five-minute intervals.

Federal Reserve staff analysis reveals that the 3 p.m. spike in trading volumes tends to be 

fairly evenly divided between the DTC and IDB market segments, suggesting that both 

dealers and proprietary trading firms play an important role during this narrow window of 

activity.  In the DTC market, the increase around 3 p.m. would be consistent with trading 

related to mutual fund daily and end-of-month portfolio rebalancing.  In the electronic 

IDB market, the increase around 3 p.m. would be consistent with the increased role of 

proprietary trading firms in intraday intermediation and the possible closeout of positions 

toward the end of the main part of the trading day.  From a market resilience perspective, 

it would be valuable to analyze these systematic intraday spikes in trading volumes, 

particularly as they may influence price formation and liquidity provision in the Treasury 

market.   

The large spike in flows toward the end of the trading day points to a financial 

stability consideration that is worth flagging.  The Treasury Market Practices Group 

(TMPG) has done valuable work in mapping out clearing and settlement patterns in the 

Treasury market.  One issue that this analysis highlights is the currently limited potential 

for same day, or T+0, settlement on transactions conducted near the end of the day.  The 

flash events we have seen in the Treasury market so far have occurred early enough in the 

day to allow time for prices to recover before market close, and they have not been 

accompanied by any participant’s failure to perform, let alone a major participant, 

platform, or exchange.   

As the TMPG’s work shows, most transactions in the Treasury market settle the 

next day, or T+1.  As can be seen in figure 8, Federal Reserve staff analysis based on the 

transactions recorded in TRACE shows that same-day settlement volumes, on average, 


 - 13 - 

represent only about 4 percent of total daily volume, with the rest concentrated primarily 

on one-day settlement.  Same-day settlement volumes since the inception of TRACE 

have never exceeded roughly 10 percent of the daily total.  Fortunately, we have not 

recently observed a large liquidation of Treasury holdings for cash at the end of the same 

day.  But we cannot rule out that this will always be the case.  It is not clear from the 

TRACE data whether the market could accommodate a large sale of Treasury securities 

later in the day, perhaps associated with a need to raise cash quickly to settle outstanding 

positions, without causing a substantial move in prices.  It will be important to follow 

closely how the market evolves in light of the potential risks and resilience issues 

identified in the recent TMPG white paper on clearing and settlement in the secondary 

market for U.S. Treasury securities.16 

Before I conclude, let me discuss one other step the Board is planning to take to 

help us keep up with the changing nature of markets.  The TRACE data are indispensable 

in the IAWG’s ability to track and understand this market.  However, FINRA’s 

collections are limited only to its members.  The Federal Reserve is close to finalizing an 

agreement with FINRA to act as our agent in expanding the collection of Treasury 

transactions to key banks that are also active in this market.  In addition, in light of recent 

changes in the market, the Board has decided to issue a notice of proposed rulemaking to 

seek public comment on collecting agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and debt 

transactions as well.  This collection will help round out the IAWG’s view of these

markets and ensure continuous coverage in circumstances where trading moves between 

the bank and the broker-dealer within a firm.  It is important that reporting thresholds be 

appropriately tailored to avoid imposing undue burden on smaller firms, and we will be 

particularly attentive to public comments on this matter. 

I see important potential benefits of transparency under appropriate 

circumstances.  The Treasury Department is currently considering these issues, and we 

would seek to harmonize our approach with any future decisions by the Treasury 

Department and the IAWG in making Treasury transactions data available to the public.  

Our expectation is also that Federal Reserve policy would be harmonized with FINRA’s 

practices in making anonymized agency MBS and debt transactions publicly available, 

taking into account what we learn from the comment process.   

Conclusion 

In sum, we recognize it is vitally important for the Federal Reserve and other 

agencies to keep up with the rapid changes we are seeing in the Treasury market.  The 

Treasury market is a cornerstone of the global financial system:  Treasury securities are 

used to finance the federal government, represent a store of value for investors and 

households alike, and serve as the primary reserve asset for the global financial system.  

The Treasury market is also vital to the Federal Reserve:  It is central to the transmission 

of our monetary policy, provides key signals on market expectations for inflation and 

future interest rates, and is a key source of high-quality liquid assets for the banking 

system.  Given the centrality of the Treasury market, it is all the more notable that access 

to data on Treasury market transactions on par with those available for futures, equity, 

and corporate bond markets is a very recent development.  The recent collection of these 


 - 15 - 

data has provided crucial insights into the resilience and structure of the Treasury market.   

Recognizing that the market will continue to evolve, we are committed to doing our part 

to make sure the scope of our data and their availability evolve commensurately.
