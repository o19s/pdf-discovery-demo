“Creating a Just Economy,” the 2017 annual conference of the 
National Community Reinvestment Coalition  

 
Washington, D.C. 


March 28, 2017 
 



Thank you for this opportunity to be part of the National Community 

Reinvestment Coalition’s annual conference.  It is a pleasure to address a group of 

organizations committed to improving the lives of low- and moderate-income Americans 

and strengthening communities.  I am especially pleased to be with you in 2017, which 

marks the 40th anniversary of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). 

As you know, the CRA requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the 

communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods.  Since its enactment, the CRA has helped channel capital into 

communities and, in the process, supported innovative and effective approaches to 

community development.   

We at the Federal Reserve take our CRA responsibilities seriously.  We evaluate 

the CRA performance of the state-chartered banks we supervise and make the ratings and 

written evaluations public.1  We currently are improving our examination procedures and 

examiner training.  We also work with our fellow bank regulators to continually improve 

our implementation of the law.  And, as many of you know, we recently revised our 

interagency guidance to clarify how various community development activities are 

considered in assessing CRA performance, among them workforce development, which 

is my topic today.2   

Workforce Development Initiatives and Challenges 

Workforce development is a bit of a catchall phrase encompassing different types 

of initiatives that help prepare people for jobs by providing them with training, placement

Answers” available at https://www.ffiec.gov/cra/qnadoc.htm.

assistance, and other support.  Organizations dedicated to providing workforce 

development are interested not just in helping people secure any jobs, but jobs that pay 

well, provide benefits, offer opportunities for advancement, and are less likely to be 

eliminated during economic downturns.  Significant job market changes in recent years, 

brought about by global competition and technological advances--and the new and 

shifting skills that these changes demand--make workforce development more important 

than ever before.  

As community development practitioners, you know that good-paying, stable jobs 

are not only important to workers and their families, but also are the foundation of strong 

neighborhoods.  As part of our CRA responsibilities, the Federal Reserve, together with 

the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the 

Currency, has made it clear that banks will receive CRA recognition for lending to, 

investing in, and providing services to workforce development initiatives.  In fact, two 

Federal Reserve Banks recently published a framework describing how workforce 

development initiatives can fit within a bank’s broader CRA strategy.3 

 While the job market for the United States as a whole has improved markedly 

since the depths of the financial crisis, the persistently higher unemployment rates in 

lower-income and minority communities show why workforce development is so 

essential.  For instance, unemployment rates averaged 13 percent in low- and moderate-

income communities from 2011 through 2015, compared with 7.3 percent in higher-

income communities.4   

The challenges for workers in minority communities are even greater.  The 

average unemployment rate across all census tracts where minorities made up a majority 

of the population averaged 14.3 percent from 2011 through 2015.  Also, a much smaller 

share of the prime working-age population in these areas is employed--67.7 percent 

during this period, which is nearly 9 percentage points lower than in communities with 

smaller minority populations.5  These elevated unemployment rates and depressed 

employment-to-population ratios underscore the strong need for effective workforce 

development options for these communities.  

Education as a Workforce Development Strategy 

Probably the most important workforce development strategy is improving the 

quality of general education.  The rapid rise in U.S. education levels in the 20th century, 

facilitated by the growing availability of high school education in the first part of the 

century and the rapid expansion of public universities after World War II, contributed 

enormously to the broad-based economic gains associated with that period.6  But, 

unfortunately, for a wide variety of reasons that are beyond the scope of this talk, 

education levels have historically lagged in low- and moderate-income communities, 

                                                 
4 Low- and moderate-income communities are census tracts with a family median income under 80 percent 
of the area median income.  Higher-income communities are census tracts with median incomes of 80 
percent of the area median income or greater.  Statistics represent the average of census tract 
unemployment rates rather than the unemployment rate across all individuals in these tracts combined. 
5 Prime-age workers are those who are aged 25 to 54.  Statistics are from the American Community Survey 
(ACS) data releases from 2011 through 2015, available on the U.S. Census Bureau’s website at 
https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs.

Journal of Economic History, vol. 61 (June), pp. 263-92, https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-
cambridge-core/content/view/S0022050701028017.

particularly communities of color.  Between 2011 and 2015, the average proportion of 

adults in low- and moderate-income communities who had dropped out of high school 

was 23.5 percent, which is more than double the 10.9 percent rate in higher-income 

communities during that period.7   

 When students from low- and moderate-income families do complete high 

school, they are less likely to pursue a college degree.  And when they do attend college, 

those students are less likely to graduate.8  Among the reasons for the disparity are a lack 

of money to pay for college and the burden of family responsibilities.9  As a result, the 

proportion of adults in low- and moderate-income communities from 2011 through 2015 

who had a four-year college degree or graduate degree was about half the share in higher-

income communities--17.6 percent versus 34 percent.10   

This educational disparity matters because, among many reasons, people with less 

education experience both higher unemployment and lower average earnings.  In 

December 2016, for example, the unemployment rate for people aged 25 and older with a 

bachelor’s or higher degree was only 2.6 percent.  However, the rate was nearly double, 

                                                 
7 Adults are defined here as individuals aged 25 and older.  Statistics are from the ACS data releases from 
2011 through 2015; see note 5. 
8 Following a cohort of high school sophomores in 2002, 96 percent of students from a high 
socioeconomic-status family pursued at least some higher education and 60 percent completed a bachelor’s 
degree.  Among students from a low socioeconomic-status family, 72 percent pursued higher education and 
14 percent completed a bachelor’s degree.  Socioeconomic status is based on family income and parents’ 
education.  See National Center for Education Statistics (2015), “Postsecondary Attainment:  Differences 
by Socioeconomic Status,” in The Condition of Education 2015 (Washington:  NCES), 
https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/pdf/coe_tva.pdf.  
9 Many people who did not enroll for or did not complete a degree also gave as a reason that they wanted to 
work, which may also reflect budget constraints that made pursuing or completing a higher education 
difficult.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on the Economic Well-
Being of U.S. Families in 2015 (Washington:  Board of Governors, May),

5.1 percent, for workers in this age group with only a high school diploma and about 

triple, 7.9 percent, for those without a high school degree.11   

While high school graduates earn somewhat more than people who did not finish 

high school, the big payoff comes with a four-year college or advanced degree.12  The 

advantages of higher education, evidenced by lower unemployment rates and higher 

earnings, are clear across the spectrum but are greater for non-Hispanic whites than for 

African Americans and Hispanics.   

Improving educational levels in low- and moderate-income communities is a 

long-term task.  At least partially because of a lack of early childhood education and the 

sometimes lower quality of schools, children in these neighborhoods score substantially 

lower on standardized tests and drop out of high school at higher rates.13  Thus, a starting 

point is to improve access to quality education in early childhood and improve the quality 

of primary and secondary schooling. 

                                                 
11 Moreover, “over 95 percent of jobs created during the recovery have gone to workers with at least some 
college education, while those with a high school diploma or less are being left behind” (as quoted from the

We must also recognize and address the barriers faced by low- and moderate-

income students trying to attain higher levels of education--barriers not typically faced by 

their more well-off peers.  First, these students often do not have friends or family who 

have achieved higher educational levels, which matters because students whose parents 

did not attend college are much less likely to pursue a college degree themselves.14  Even 

so, these students can benefit from high school counselors or other mentors who can 

assist them in choosing schools that provide the financial and counseling support that will 

help them complete their degrees.  And they can benefit from help in picking majors and 

degrees that lead to higher earnings. 15   

Second, lower-income students often pursue their education while working to 

support themselves and family members.  Educational programs that help students 

balance these competing responsibilities go a long way to improving completion rates.  In 

recognition of this fact, the U.S. Department of Education is offering competitive grants 

to postsecondary institutions to support or establish campus-based childcare programs 

primarily serving the needs of low-income students.16 

I want to reiterate that addressing the particular barriers standing in the way of 

lower-income students attending college and earning a degree requires a long-term 

                                                 
14 For example, 65 percent of young adults (aged 25 to 34) with a parent who received a bachelor’s degree 
completed one themselves, compared with 16 percent of young adults whose parents completed no 
education beyond high school.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), Report on 
the Economic Well-Being of U.S Households in 2015 (Washington:  Board of Governors, May),

strategy.  However, not every student wants a two- or four-year degree or will have the 

financial wherewithal to pursue and complete a postsecondary degree.  To support 

programs aimed at students not bound for college, in 2015, the Federal Reserve Banks of 

Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Atlanta identified occupations with above-average wages 

for workers without a bachelor's degree in the country’s 100 largest metropolitan areas.17  

The Reserve Banks made this information available to workforce development providers 

online and in workshops.  Educational programs and training that lead to better paying 

and more steady work are crucial for people without college degrees, particularly lower-

income workers.   

Workforce Development Programs in Action 

In the rest of my remarks, I would like to highlight some examples of successful 

initiatives that illustrate key features of effective workforce development.18  As you 

know, within our community affairs offices, the Federal Reserve devotes considerable 

effort to studying and promoting effective workforce development, so I am able to draw 

                                                 
17 Top occupations noted across all MSAs included the following: registered nurses; first-line supervisors 
of office and administrative support workers; sales representatives, wholesale and manufacturing; business 
operations specialists, sales representative services; general and operations managers; computer system 
analysts; automotive service technicians and mechanics; first-line supervisors of construction trades and 
extraction work; plumbers, pipefitters, and steamfitters; first-line supervisors of mechanics, installers; and 
construction laborers.  See Keith Wardrip, Kyle Fee, Lisa Nelson, and Stuart Andreason, Identifying 
Opportunity Occupations in the Nation’s Largest Metropolitan Economies, Federal Reserve Banks of 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Ohio (Cleveland:  FSB of Cleveland), available at 
https://www.clevelandfed.org/newsroom-and-events/publications/special-reports/sr-20150909-identifying-
opportunity-occupations.aspx.  
18 For a broad summary of recent research and policy issues related to workforce development, see the 2015 
publication Transforming U.S. Workforce Development Policies for the 21st Century (available at 
https://www.kansascityfed.org/publications/community/transformworkforce) developed by the Federal 
Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Kansas City in partnership with the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce 
Development at Rutgers University.  In addition, all Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors are 
currently engaged in a System workforce development initiative that will gather up-to-date perspectives 
from employers and organizations engaged in worker training and education.  This initiative will include a 
series of regional Reserve Bank meetings, a publication on effective investments and outcomes, and a 
capstone conference in October in Austin, Texas.

on the knowledge and experience of our staff.  In discussing the examples, I would like to 

make five points.  

First, it is crucial for younger workers to establish a solid connection to 

employment early in their work lives.  The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Young 

Workers found that 18- to 30-year-olds with early work experience were more likely to 

emerge from the recent recession with a permanent job.19  Other studies have found that 

students who worked 20 hours per week in their senior year of high school earned higher 

wages later in life than those who did not, and that summer youth employment programs 

improved participants’ attitudes toward their communities, raised their academic 

aspirations, and boosted their job readiness skills.20  The findings point to some of the 

reasons that the Boston Fed decided to lend technical support to a pilot program called 

Pocket Change, which aims to reduce unemployment among low-income 18- to 24-year-

olds in Somerville, Massachusetts, through internships, training in job skills, and 

reinforcement of important soft skills such as punctuality and effective communication.  

In its first two years, the initiative trained 53 low-income young people and placed 20 of 

them in jobs.  The results of this modest program indicate the promise of efforts that 

                                                 
19 The survey found that 82 percent of workers who had worked for pay during high school had a 
permanent job--4 percentage points higher than for all workers combined.  See Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2014), In the Shadow of the Great Recession:  Experiences and Perspectives of 
Young Workers (Washington:  Board of Governors, November), 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/2013-experiences-and-perspectives-of-young-workers-
201411.pdf. 
20 Baum and Ruhm (2016) do observe, however, that these gains from employment during the 
senior year of high school have diminished substantially relative to earlier cohorts.  See Charles L. 
Baum and Christopher J. Ruhm (2016), “The Changing Benefits of Early Work Experience,” 
Southern Economic Journal, vol. 83 (October), pp. 343-63.

focus on first-time work experiences, and Somerville is now seeking to expand the 

initiative.21 

My second observation is that career and technical education (CTE) programs, 

which have seen a revival in recent years, have considerable potential.  For some time, 

vocational education had fallen out of favor or was in decline in the United States, as it 

was associated with the deleterious practice of “tracking” less advantaged students that 

denied them the opportunity for the best education.  But more recently, CTE has been 

refined and has made a comeback as an effective way to help non-college-bound workers 

gain valuable skills and obtain a foothold in a labor market that increasingly requires 

technical proficiency.  These programs teach the skills needed to pursue careers in fields 

such as construction, manufacturing, health care, information technology, hospitality, and 

financial services.   

This point brings me to my third observation, which is that effective CTE 

programs and other workforce development initiatives are able to match education and 

training to good-paying jobs when they actively engage employers in the training 

process.  WorkAdvance, a regional sector-specific program, is a good example.  It 

delivers an array of aligned services to meet local business needs and provide jobs for 

unemployed and low-income adults in multiple cities.22  An evaluation of the program 

last year in Tulsa, New York City, and northeast Ohio found it was especially effective 

                                                 
21 For more information on Pocket Change, see the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s Working Cities 
Challenge webpage at 
https://www.bostonfed.org/workingcities/massachusetts/round1/cities/somerville.html. 
22 Aligned services may include intensive screening, occupational skills training, job development and 
placement services, and retention and advancement services.

because it offered training for in-demand skills and industry-recognized certifications, 

and it focused on jobs that have clear paths for advancement.23 

A fourth observation is that apprenticeships, which are more common in other 

countries, could play a larger role for low- and moderate-income individuals in our 

country as part of broader career and technical education efforts.  For instance, a state-run 

program in South Carolina, Apprenticeship Carolina, helps employers develop 

apprenticeships at no cost to them.  Businesses receive a $1,000 annual tax credit per 

apprenticeship, and the program assists them with information and technical needs, 

paperwork, and the integration of classroom learning at local technical colleges.  The 

program has led to sizable job gains at a modest cost to the state.24  Similarly, 

Washington State registered apprenticeship programs contributed to substantial long-term 

increases in employment rates and hourly wages.25  

My fifth and final observation is that promoting entrepreneurship could play a 

greater role in workforce development.  Entrepreneurship is a fundamental strength of the 

American economy, and owning your own business or working for yourself can offer 

income, a means of building wealth, and, sometimes, greater flexibility for balancing job 

and family commitments.  Yet we see less self-employment in low- and moderate-income

communities.26  Moreover, when businesses are owned by minorities, they are less likely 

to have paid employees.27  These findings speak to the opportunities that could be 

realized by helping people start their own businesses and then helping them grow their 

businesses.  Programs that equip people with the management skills and knowledge they 

need to start and operate a successful small business can help.  Relevant and effective 

training can reduce the failure rate of businesses by helping owners make better decisions 

and avoid costly mistakes.28  These programs are especially critical in low-income and 

rural communities where other resources to support small business development may be 

scarce. 

As part of their community affairs work, several Federal Reserve Banks have 

small business development initiatives.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

organized a small business protection and education series last year in partnership with 

the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce and a local development corporation.  Participants 

learned about capital resources available to small businesses, online credit alternatives for 

small businesses, and the risks of handling large volumes of cash.  In another example, 

the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City developed a guide to help rural and smaller 

                                                 
26 From 2011 through 2015, only 8 percent of households in low- and moderate-income communities 
reported self-employment income, compared with 11 percent of all households (see ACS data releases in 
note 5).  
27 Only 4 percent of African American-owned firms and 9 percent of Hispanic-owned firms have paid 
employees, compared with 22 percent of non-minority-owned firms; see U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Minority Business Development Agency (2016), “U.S. Minority-Owned Firms,” fact sheet (Washington:  
MBDA, January), www.mbda.gov/sites/default/files/2012SBO_MBEFactSheet020216.pdf.

metropolitan communities promote conditions favorable to growing local businesses 

rather than relying only on efforts to attract large companies.29   

Of course, in addition to training, small business owners need financing.  But, as 

many of you know, factors such as lack of a credit history or a poor credit history and 

limited collateral--for example, home equity--make it difficult for the owners of small 

enterprises to access traditional business credit.  This situation is true for many minority, 

women, and low-income borrowers.30  Nontraditional lenders, including more than 1,000 

Community Development Financial Institutions around the country, help fill the gap.31   

Conclusion 

To conclude, while the economy overall is recovering and the job market has 

improved substantially since the recession, pockets of persistently high unemployment, as 

well as other challenges, remain.  Fortunately, programs such as the ones I have 

highlighted today can help address these challenges in more targeted ways than the 

Federal Reserve is equipped to do through monetary policy.  I want you to know that we 

applaud your work, and we thank you for doing all that you do to serve the needs of 

lower-income communities across the country.  Whether you work to provide affordable 

housing, homeownership counseling, small business credit and technical support, or 

workforce development, I hope you know that you have a partner in the Federal Reserve.  

In the ways we can, with the different tools we each have, our aim is the same:  to make
