This paper reviews Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) communications 

from the time the Committee began issuing regular postmeeting statements in 1999 to the 

present.1  The authors provide an extended and insightful discussion of the theory and 

practice of providing forward guidance about monetary policy.  They offer one central 

lesson:  Data-based forward guidance is mostly good, while time-based forward guidance 

is mostly bad.   

The authors show that data-based guidance has desirable characteristics and can 

make monetary policy more effective.  When clearly articulated and well understood, it 

allows markets to react appropriately to incoming data, doing the heavy lifting for the 

central bank.   

Time-based guidance is found to have certain bad characteristics and should be 

avoided, except at the zero lower bound and when other options are not available or not 

working.  Time-based guidance may reduce the sensitivity of rates to incoming 

macroeconomic data, suppress volatility, encourage risk-taking and increased leverage, 

and threaten financial stability.  It may also put policymakers in a box when changes in 

the economy make it optimal to deviate from previously expressed guidance, but the 

Committee cannot do so without losing credibility.   

The authors blame time-based guidance for several episodes in which the 

Committee zigged when the market looked for it to zag, leaving market participants 

unhappy and, in the authors’ view, the FOMC’s credibility damaged.  They argue that the

Committee has relied too much on time-based guidance in recent years and should use it 

only parsimoniously in the future. 

I commend the authors for undertaking this enormously challenging and useful 

exercise.  The paper forces us to reconsider the Committee’s evolving understanding of 

the macroeconomic environment before, during, and after the Great Recession; its 

decisions and its communications; and the market’s understanding of those decisions, 

which have sometimes deviated from what the Committee actually said. 

The distinction between time-based and data-based guidance is an important one, 

and the potential problems with time-based guidance are real and well described in the 

paper.  That said, I am not convinced that this distinction has played a central role in 

determining the successes and challenges of FOMC communications in this remarkable 

era, or that it helps us improve in the future.  The authors are, in their words, 

“unabashedly judgmental” in labeling specific communications to be either time- or data-

based.2  My own judgments differ in significant respects from those described in the 

paper. 

Discussion of Forward Guidance 

I will start in December 2008, when the Committee said that “weak economic 

conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for 

some time.”3  This relatively weak time-based guidance was strengthened in a series of 

steps until August 2011, when the time-based language became “at least through mid-

2013.”4  The calendar reference was later extended in a couple of steps to “at least 

through mid-2015.”5  This guidance was explicitly time-based, and the authors seem to 

agree that, through this point, the guidance served its intended purpose at the zero lower 

bound by pushing down medium- and longer-term rates.6 

At the December 2012 meeting, the Committee ended this calendar-based 

guidance.  The Committee instead adopted thresholds, saying that it did not intend to 

raise rates at least as long as unemployment remained above 6½ percent, inflation one to 

two years ahead was projected to be no higher than 2½ percent, and longer-term inflation 

expectations remained well anchored.7  The adoption of thresholds was a clear change to 

data-based guidance, as its principal sponsors had frequently urged.8  The point was not

6 Some viewed this guidance as merely a forecast of Committee action, designed to better inform the 
market and reduce uncertainty.  Others have argued that such guidance is understood as a promise to which 
the Committee will be held irrespective of future macroeconomic developments.  The Committee never 
offered a single explanation, and participants may have had different views.  Engen, Laubach, and 
Reifschneider (2015) argue that the Federal Reserve’s time-based guidance initiated in August 2011 was 
highly effective in inducing market participants to change their beliefs about the Committee’s reaction 
function and to regard monetary policy as more accommodative.  Using Blue Chip survey data, the authors 
estimate that the perceived weight on resource slack roughly doubled between March 2011 and March 
2012.  In an August 2011 speech, Chairman Bernanke indicated that the guidance about the federal funds 
rate path was highly conditional on the outlook, saying, “in what the Committee judges to be the most 
likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in the medium term, the target for the federal funds 
rate would be held at its current low levels for at least two more years.”  (Ben S. Bernanke (2011), “The 
Near- and Longer-Term Prospects for the U.S. Economy,” a speech delivered at “Achieving Maximum 
Long-Run Growth,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson

to provide additional stimulus at the time of adoption, but rather to allow market 

participants to adjust their expectations about future monetary policy in response to 

incoming data--exactly what the authors advocate.9 

The Committee also used balance sheet policy through most of this period.  The 

first two programs of large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs), popularly known as QE1 and 

QE2, and the maturity extension program were announced in terms of time and quantity--

that is, a certain quantity of assets would be purchased over a certain time.  In adopting 

QE3, by contrast, the Committee committed to continuing purchases until there was a 

substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.10  QE3 was fully data-

contingent. 

Former Chairman Bernanke recounts in his recent book that he saw QE3 as akin 

to Mario Draghi’s statement that the European Central Bank would do “whatever it 

takes.”11  He also notes that FOMC participants held divergent views on the potential 

costs and benefits of the program.  Minutes of the relevant meetings described the 

complex discussions and differing views.  Contemporaneous reports by Wall Street 

analysts show frustration and confusion about the Committee’s intentions. 

When various FOMC communications suggested that the time to begin reducing 

purchases was nearing, long-term rates rose sharply--the so-called taper tantrum.  The 

                                                   
9 The thresholds’ useful life was fairly short because the unemployment rate fell sharply, from 8.0 percent 
in December 2012 to 6.2 percent in April 2014, while inflation remained below 2.0 percent.   
10 The December 2012 FOMC statement indicated that, “If the outlook for the labor market does not 
improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed 
securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context 
of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, 
as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.”  (Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press 
release, December 12, paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121212a.htm.)

contention of this paper is that time-based guidance was responsible.  But as the paper 

acknowledges, the open-ended, data-contingent nature of the QE3 program created a 

strong sense that the Fed was “all in” and that the purchases might go on for a long time.  

That powerful commitment “would set things up for some fireworks” when the time 

came to provide more precise guidance as to the timing of tapering, whether that was 

done through time- or data-based guidance.12  While Committee communications are 

subject to fair criticism, I don’t see an important role in this narrative for time-based 

guidance. 

Let’s turn briefly to 2015 and the run-up to last December’s increase in the federal 

funds rate--also an important focus of the paper.  The authors and many market 

participants are critical of communication around the September meeting.  With the June 

2015 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) showing that 15 of 17 FOMC participants 

judged that appropriate policy would entail an initial increase in the federal funds rate by 

the end of 2015, markets saw about a 50 percent chance that the first increase would 

occur in September.  This probability fell to about 30 percent after global markets 

experienced a sudden bout of volatility following China’s surprise devaluation of its 

currency in August.  At the September meeting, the FOMC decided to wait to see how 

global markets and the economy evolved, noting in its statement that “Recent global 

economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are 

likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near term.”13

A data-driven Committee, making decisions meeting by meeting, is likely to 

surprise markets from time to time.  The authors join many others in criticizing the 

“measured pace” period of 2004 through 2006, during which the Committee increased 

rates by 25 basis points at 17 consecutive FOMC meetings.  A common criticism has 

been that this high level of predictability made investors complacent, encouraging a 

buildup of leverage and helping set the stage for the Global Financial Crisis.  That 

criticism may well overstate the importance of the Committee’s communications; 

nonetheless, a number of FOMC participants have said that the Committee intends to be 

“data driven” and not fall into an excessively predictable, data-insensitive path.  Lower 

predictability implies more surprises. 

In the statement released after its October 2015 meeting, the Committee 

reemphasized data dependence and focused on the importance of incoming data for the 

Committee’s decision “at its next meeting,” which led the market to increase its estimated 

probability of a December rate increase from 38 percent to 50 percent.14  The October 

and November non-farm payroll reports came in strong and above expectations, raising 

that probability by the time of the December meeting to about 90 percent.  In other 

words, the Committee used modest time-based guidance to set the stage and then let 

incoming data do the heavy lifting.  In the statement released after the FOMC’s most 

recent meeting in January, the Committee said that, in evaluating future adjustments to 

the target range for the federal funds rate, it would “assess realized and expected 

economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent

inflation.”15  This language shows that the Committee has moved away from the time-

based guidance of the crisis years. 

Although time-based guidance can create communications challenges, I see other 

factors as having been more important in recent years.  In particular, the challenge of 

deciding when and how to use unconventional tools--and ultimately when and how to 

reduce that usage--is a great one.  The task of communicating clearly about those 

decisions is equally great.  And the reality of the FOMC’s size and diversity, not to 

mention uncertainty about the evolving structure of the economy and the effects of 

monetary policy actions, means that we are still far from the ideal world of a fully 

worked out, clearly specified and transparent consensus on what economists call a 

“reaction function”--a complete description of how policy will respond to changes in 

economic conditions. 

Often when communicating about the path of policy, it will be hard to avoid a 

combination of the two forms of guidance.  For example, the Committee has embraced 

the view that the equilibrium level of the federal funds rate is currently below its pre-

crisis level and expects the funds rate to return only gradually to its longer-run value.16  

This view is a key aspect of many Committee participants’ reaction functions, including 

mine.  Try saying that without referring to time.

press release, January 27, paragraph 4, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm.  
16 For example, the January 2016 FOMC statement says, “The Committee expects that economic conditions 
will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds 
rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.”  (Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2016), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement,” press 
release, January 27, paragraph 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20160127a.htm.)

The authors acknowledge that the distinction between rules and discretion is too 

simple to capture the problems that monetary policymakers face.17  I would say the same 

of the distinction between time-based and data-based forward guidance. 

Lessons Learned and Suggested Improvements 

Before turning to the paper’s conclusions, I would like to put the Federal 

Reserve’s communications into a broader context.  In recent years, the FOMC has 

adopted many new and significant communications tools.  Since the fall of 2007, 

policymakers have submitted projections in conjunction with four FOMC meetings each 

year; in 2012, those projections were augmented to include each participant’s path for 

appropriate monetary policy.  In 2011, the Chairman began holding quarterly press 

conferences.  In 2012, the Committee first released its statement on Longer-run Goals 

and Monetary Policy Strategy, which formalized the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation 

objective and is reaffirmed each year at the January meeting.  These and other changes 

have kept the Federal Reserve among the world’s most transparent central banks in its 

communications with the public. 

With that as background, I find significant grounds for agreement and further 

analysis in the paper’s concluding section, which lays out lessons learned and suggested 

improvements.  The discussion of what is colloquially known as the “dot plot” included 

in the SEP is particularly interesting.  The dot plot represents each FOMC participant’s 

                                                   
17 Feroli and others, “Language after Liftoff,” in note 1, p. 11; and Ben S. Bernanke and Frederic S. 
Mishkin (1997), “Inflation Targeting:  A New Framework for Monetary Policy?” Journal of Economic 
Perspectives, vol. 11 (Spring), pp. 97-116.

individual assessment of the path of the federal funds rate over the next three years that is 

most likely to promote maximum employment and stable prices.18 

The dot plot presents a number of challenges.  The individual dots are not tied to 

the individual macroeconomic forecasts presented in the SEP, and no information is 

provided on the identity of the forecaster--for example, voting members of the 

Committee are not distinguished from non-voting participants.  There is no easy path to 

the identification of a Committee reaction function.  The dots speak as of their date of 

publication after the FOMC meetings held in March, June, September, and December.  

Three months pass between SEPs.  The economic outlook can change quite significantly, 

making the reigning dots look out of touch.  On occasion, the dot plot and the 

postmeeting statement have seemed to send conflicting signals.  The dot plot reflects 

individual views of appropriate policy, while the postmeeting statement reflects the 

consensus of the Committee. 

The authors weigh these challenges and ponder whether to eliminate the dot plot; 

some appear to favor that idea.19  I doubt that most market participants would welcome 

the elimination of this chart.  The SEP provides a number of benefits.  It requires FOMC 

participants to write down their forecasts for inflation, unemployment, and growth, as 

                                                   
18 In the SEP collected prior to the March and June FOMC meetings, participants submit projections for the 
current calendar year and two subsequent years; in the September SEP, the forecast horizon is extended out 
an additional calendar year.  Thus, the forecast window does not remain constant for the different SEPs in a 
given year; Wrightson commentary has suggested that a rolling forecast horizon might be an improvement 
over the current calendar-year focus (Wrightson ICAP (2016), “January 26-27 FOMC Minutes Recap,” 
February 18). 
19 For instance, Michael Feroli (as quoted in a recent article) said, “I think they have outlived their 
usefulness and they risk sending a signal that (Fed officials) have a ‘plan’ rather than that they are data 
dependent” (see Ann Saphir (2016), “Fed’s ‘Dot Plot’ Looks Increasingly out of Touch on Rates,” Markets, 
Reuters, February 14, paragraph 8, http://in.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-path-analysis-
idINKCN0VN0PU); and in a 2012 speech, former Governor of the Bank of Canada Mark Carney stated, 
“Overall research has not generally found that publishing a path leads to better outcomes.”  (Mark Carney 
(2012), “Guidance,” a speech delivered to the CFA Society Toronto, Toronto, Canada, December 11, 
paragraph 24, www.bankofcanada.ca/2012/12/guidance.

well as their assessments of appropriate monetary policy.  This exercise helps 

policymakers to be more systematic.  In addition, by observing how the SEP changes 

over time, the public can better understand how Committee members react to changes in 

the economy.  My view is that the dot plot, on balance, is helpful to market participants 

and hence to the Committee.  As the dot plot enters its fifth year of existence, my hope is 

that we will be able to capture those benefits while avoiding its shortcomings. 

I agree with the paper’s suggestion of greater emphasis on the degree of 

uncertainty around the projections, which is much larger than the dispersion of the 

individual forecasts.  As you know, at its January meeting, the Committee discussed 

adding fan charts to the SEP.  Fan charts could help emphasize that the economic outlook 

is uncertain, and that consequently there is considerable uncertainty around the path of 

policy.
