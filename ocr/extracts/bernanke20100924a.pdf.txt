On the Implications of the Financial Crisis for Economics 


Remarks by

Chairman 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the 
 

Conference co-sponsored by 
 

the Bendheim Center for Finance and the Center for Economic Policy Studies

September 24, 2010 



 Thank you for giving me this opportunity to return to Princeton.  It is good to be 

able to catch up with old friends and colleagues and to see both the changes and the 

continuities on campus.  I am particularly pleased to see that the Bendheim Center for 

Finance is thriving.  When my colleagues and I founded the center a decade ago, we 

intended it to be a place where students would learn about not only the technicalities of 

modern financial theory and practice but also about the broader economic context of 

financial activities.  Recent events have made clear that understanding the role of 

financial markets and institutions in the economy, and of the effects of economic 

developments on finance, is more important than ever. 

The financial crisis that began more than three years ago has indeed proved to be 

among the most difficult challenges for economic policymakers since the Great 

Depression.  The policy response to this challenge has included important successes, 

most notably the concerted international effort to stabilize the global financial system 

after the crisis reached its worst point in the fall of 2008.  For its part, the Federal Reserve 

worked closely with other policymakers, both domestically and internationally, to help 

develop the collective response to the crisis, and it played a key role in that response by 

providing backstop liquidity to a range of financial institutions as needed to stem the 

panic.  The Fed also developed special lending facilities that helped to restore normal 

functioning to critical financial markets, including the commercial paper market and the 

market for asset-backed securities; led the bank stress tests in the spring of 2009 that 

significantly improved confidence in the U.S. banking system; and, in the area of 

monetary policy, took aggressive and innovative actions that helped to stabilize the 

economy and lay the groundwork for recovery.

Despite these and other policy successes, the episode as a whole has not been kind 

to the reputation of economic and economists, and understandably so.  Almost 

universally, economists failed to predict the nature, timing, or severity of the crisis; and 

those few who issued early warnings generally identified only isolated weaknesses in the 

system, not anything approaching the full set of complex linkages and mechanisms that 

amplified the initial shocks and ultimately resulted in a devastating global crisis and 

recession.  Moreover, although financial markets are for the most part functioning 

normally now, a concerted policy effort has so far not produced an economic recovery of 

sufficient vigor to significantly reduce the high level of unemployment.  As a result of 

these developments, some observers have suggested the need for an overhaul of 

economics as a discipline, arguing that much of the research in macroeconomics and 

finance in recent decades has been of little value or even counterproductive.   

Although economists have much to learn from this crisis, as I will discuss, I think 

that calls for a radical reworking of the field go too far.  In particular, it seems to me that 

current critiques of economics sometimes conflate three overlapping yet separate 

enterprises, which, for the purposes of my remarks today, I will call economic science, 

economic engineering, and economic management.  Economic science concerns itself 

primarily with theoretical and empirical generalizations about the behavior of individuals, 

institutions, markets, and national economies.  Most academic research falls in this 

category.  Economic engineering is about the design and analysis of frameworks for 

achieving specific economic objectives.  Examples of such frameworks are the risk-

management systems of financial institutions and the financial regulatory systems of the 

United States and other countries.  Economic management involves the operation of 


-3- 
 

economic frameworks in real time--for example, in the private sector, the management of 

complex financial institutions or, in the public sector, the day-to-day supervision of those 

institutions.   

As you may have already guessed, my terminology is intended to invoke a loose 

analogy with science and engineering.  Underpinning any practical scientific or 

engineering endeavor, such as a moon shot, a heart transplant, or the construction of a 

skyscraper are:  first, fundamental scientific knowledge; second, principles of design and 

engineering, derived from experience and the application of fundamental knowledge; and 

third, the management of the particular endeavor, often including the coordination of the 

efforts of many people in a complex enterprise while dealing with myriad uncertainties.  

Success in any practical undertaking requires all three components.  For example, the 

fight to control AIDS requires scientific knowledge about the causes and mechanisms of 

the disease (the scientific component), the development of medical technologies and 

public health strategies (the engineering applications), and the implementation of those 

technologies and strategies in specific communities and for individual patients (the 

management aspect).  Twenty years ago, AIDS mortality rates mostly reflected gaps in 

scientific understanding and in the design of drugs and treatment technologies; today, the 

problem is more likely to be a lack of funding or trained personnel to carry out programs 

or to apply treatments. 

With that taxonomy in hand, I would argue that the recent financial crisis was 

more a failure of economic engineering and economic management than of what I have 

called economic science.  The economic engineering problems were reflected in a 

number of structural weaknesses in our financial system.  In the private sector, these 


-4- 
 

weaknesses included inadequate risk-measurement and risk-management systems at 

many financial firms as well as shortcomings in some firms’ business models, such as 

overreliance on unstable short-term funding and excessive leverage.  In the public sector, 

gaps and blind spots in the financial regulatory structures of the United States and most 

other countries proved particularly damaging.  These regulatory structures were designed 

for earlier eras and did not adequately adapt to rapid change and innovation in the 

financial sector, such as the increasing financial intermediation taking place outside of 

regulated depository institutions through the so-called shadow banking system.  In the 

realm of economic management, the leaders of financial firms, market participants, and 

government policymakers either did not recognize important structural problems and 

emerging risks or, when they identified them, did not respond sufficiently quickly or 

forcefully to address them.  Shortcomings of what I have called economic science, in 

contrast, were for the most part less central to the crisis; indeed, although the great 

majority of economists did not foresee the near-collapse of the financial system, 

economic analysis has proven and will continue to prove critical in understanding the 

crisis, in developing policies to contain it, and in designing longer-term solutions to 

prevent its recurrence. 

I don’t want to push this analogy too far.  Economics as a discipline differs in 

important ways from science and engineering; the latter, dealing as they do with 

inanimate objects rather than willful human beings, can often be far more precise in their 

predictions.  Also, the distinction between economic science and economic engineering 

can be less sharp than my analogy may suggest, as much economic research has direct 

policy implications.  And although I don’t think the crisis by any means requires us to 


-5- 
 

rethink economics and finance from the ground up, it did reveal important shortcomings 

in our understanding of certain aspects of the interaction of financial markets, institutions, 

and the economy as a whole, as I will discuss.  Certainly, the crisis should lead--indeed, it 

is already leading--to a greater focus on research related to financial instability and its 

implications for the broader economy. 

In the remainder of my remarks, I will focus on the implications of the crisis for 

what I have been calling economic science, that is, basic economic research and analysis.  

I will first provide a few examples of how economic principles and economic research, 

rather than having misled us, have significantly enhanced our understanding of the crisis 

and are informing the regulatory response.  However, the crisis did reveal some gaps in 

economists’ knowledge that should be remedied.  I will discuss some of these gaps and 

suggest possible directions for future research that could ultimately help us achieve 

greater financial and macroeconomic stability. 

How Economics Helped Us Understand and Respond to the Crisis 

 The financial crisis represented an enormously complex set of interactions--

indeed, a discussion of the triggers that touched off the crisis and the vulnerabilities in the 

financial system and in financial regulation that allowed the crisis to have such 

devastating effects could more than fill my time this afternoon.1

                                                 
1 For a more comprehensive discussion of vulnerabilities and triggers during the financial crisis, see Ben S. 
Bernanke (2010), “Causes of the Recent Financial and Economic Crisis,” testimony before the Financial 
Crisis Inquiry Commission, September 2, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/testimony/bernanke20100902a.htm. 

  The complexity of our 

financial system, and the resulting difficulty of predicting how developments in one 

financial market or institution may affect the system as a whole, presented formidable 

challenges.  But, at least in retrospect, economic principles and research were quite useful 


-6- 
 

for understanding key aspects of the crisis and for designing appropriate policy 

responses.  

For example, the excessive dependence of some financial firms on unstable short-

term funding led to runs on key institutions, with highly adverse implications for the 

functioning of the system as a whole.  The fact that dependence on unstable short-term 

funding could lead to runs is hardly news to economists; it has been a central issue in 

monetary economics since Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot wrote about the question 

in the 19th century.2

                                                 
2 See Henry Thornton ([1802] 1962), An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great 
Britain (New York:  A. M. Kelley); and Walter Bagehot ([1873] 1897), Lombard Street:  A Description of 
the Money Market (New York:  Charles Scribner’s Sons).  A discussion relating the Federal Reserve's 
policy actions during the financial crisis to the ideas of Bagehot is contained in Brian F. Madigan (2009), 
“Bagehot’s Dictum in Practice:  Formulating and Implementing Policies to Combat the Financial Crisis,” 
speech delivered at “Financial Stability and Macroeconomic Policy,” a symposium sponsored by the 
Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 20-22, available at 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/madigan20090821a.htm.  See also Ben S. Bernanke (2008), 
“Liquidity Provision by the Federal Reserve,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 
Financial Markets Conference (via satellite), held in Sea Island, Ga., May 13, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20080513.htm. 

  Indeed, the recent crisis bore a striking resemblance to the bank 

runs that figured so prominently in Thornton’s and Bagehot’s eras; but in this case, the 

run occurred outside the traditional banking system, in the shadow banking system--

consisting of financial institutions other than regulated depository institutions, such as 

securitization vehicles, money market funds, and investment banks.  Prior to the crisis, 

these institutions had become increasingly dependent on various forms of short-term 

wholesale funding, as had some globally active commercial banks.  Examples of such 

funding include commercial paper, repurchase agreements (repos), and securities lending.  

In the years immediately before the crisis, some of these forms of funding grew 

especially rapidly; for example, repo liabilities of U.S. broker-dealers increased by a 


-7- 
 

factor of 2-1/2 in the four years before the crisis, and a good deal of this expansion 

reportedly funded holdings of relatively less liquid securities. 

In the historically familiar bank run during the era before deposit insurance, retail 

depositors who heard rumors about the health of their bank--whether true or untrue--

would line up to withdraw their funds.  If the run continued, then, absent intervention by 

the central bank or some other provider of liquidity, the bank would run out of the cash 

necessary to pay off depositors and then fail as a result.  Often, the panic would spread as 

other banks with similar characteristics to, or having a financial relationship with, the one 

that had failed came under suspicion.  In the recent crisis, money market mutual funds 

and their investors, as well as other providers of short-term funding, were the economic 

equivalent of early-1930s retail depositors.  Shadow banks relied on these providers to 

fund longer-term credit instruments, including securities backed by subprime mortgages.  

After house prices began to decline, concerns began to build about the quality of 

subprime mortgage loans and, consequently, about the quality of the securities into which 

these and other forms of credit had been packaged.  Although many shadow banks had 

limited exposure to subprime loans and other questionable credits, the complexity of the 

securities involved and the opaqueness of many of the financial arrangements made it 

difficult for investors to distinguish relative risks.  In an environment of heightened 

uncertainty, many investors concluded that simply withdrawing funds was the easier and 

more prudent alternative.  In turn, financial institutions, knowing the risks posed by a run, 

began to hoard cash, which dried up liquidity and significantly limited their willingness 

to extend new credit.3

Because the runs on the shadow banking system occurred in a historically 

unfamiliar context, outside the commercial banking system, both the private sector and 

the regulators insufficiently anticipated the risk that such runs might occur.  However, 

once the threat became apparent, two centuries of economic thinking on runs and panics 

were available to inform the diagnosis and the policy response.  In particular, in the 

recent episode, central banks around the world followed the dictum set forth by Bagehot 

in 1873:  To avert or contain panics, central banks should lend freely to solvent 

institutions, against good collateral.4

(2009), “Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008,” Journal of Economic Perspectives, 
vol. 23 (Winter), pp. 77-100. 

  The Federal Reserve indeed acted quickly to 

provide liquidity to the banking system, for example, by easing lending terms at the 

discount window and establishing regular auctions in which banks could bid for term 

central bank credit.  Invoking emergency powers not used since the 1930s, the Federal 

Reserve also found ways to provide liquidity to critical parts of the shadow banking 

system, including securities dealers, the commercial paper market, money market mutual 

funds, and the asset-backed securities market.  For today’s purposes, my point is not to 

review this history but instead to point out that, in its policy response, the Fed was relying 

4 Bagehot also suggested that “these loans should only be made at a very high rate of interest” (Lombard 
Street, p. 99; see note 2).  Some modern commentators have rationalized Bagehot’s dictum to lend at a high 
or “penalty” rate as a way to mitigate moral hazard--that is, to help maintain incentives for private-sector 
banks to provide for adequate liquidity in advance of any crisis.  However, the risk of moral hazard did not 
appear to be Bagehot’s principal motivation for recommending a high rate; rather, he saw it as a tool to 
dissuade unnecessary borrowing and thus help protect the Bank of England’s own finite store of liquid 
assets.  See Bernanke, “Liquidity Provision,” in note 2 for further documentation.  Today, potential 
limitations on the central bank’s lending capacity are not nearly so pressing an issue as in Bagehot’s time, 
when the central bank’s ability to provide liquidity was far more tenuous.  Generally, the Federal Reserve 
lent at rates above the “normal” rate for the market but lower than the rate prevailing in distressed and 
illiquid markets.  This strategy provided needed liquidity while encouraging borrowers to return to private 
markets when conditions normalized.

on well-developed economic ideas that have deep historical roots.5

Economic research and analysis have proved useful in understanding many other 

aspects of the crisis as well.  For example, one of the most important developments in 

economics over recent decades has been the flowering of information economics, which 

studies how incomplete information or differences in information among economic 

agents affect market outcomes.

  The problem in this 

case was not a lack of professional understanding of how runs come about or how central 

banks and other authorities should respond to them.  Rather, the problem was the failure 

of both private- and public-sector actors to recognize the potential for runs in an 

institutional context quite different than the circumstances that had given rise to such 

events in the past.  These failures in turn were partly the result of a regulatory structure 

that had not adapted adequately to the rise of shadow banking and that placed insufficient 

emphasis on the detection of systemic risks, as opposed to risks to individual institutions 

and markets.

5 A substantial modern literature has updated and formalized many of the insights of Bagehot and 
Thornton.  A classic example is Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig (1983), “Bank Runs, Deposit 
Insurance, and Liquidity” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 91 (3), pp. 401-19. 

  An important branch of information economics, 

principal-agent theory, considers the implications of differences in information between 

the principals in a relationship (say, the shareholders of a firm) and the agents who work 

for the principals (say, the firm’s managers).  Because the agent typically has more 

information than the principal--managers tend to know more about the firm’s 

opportunities and problems than do the shareholders, for example--and because the 

financial interests of the principal and the agent are not perfectly aligned, much depends

their leadership in the development of information economics.

on the contract (whether explicit or implicit) between the principal and the agent, and, in 

particular, on the incentives that the contract provides the agent.  

Poorly structured incentives were pervasive in the crisis.  For example, 

compensation practices at financial institutions, which often tied bonuses to short-term 

results and made insufficient adjustments for risk, contributed to an environment in 

which both top managers and lower-level employees, such as traders and loan officers, 

took excessive risks.  Serious problems with the structure of incentives also emerged in 

the application of the so-called originate-to-distribute model to subprime mortgages.  To 

satisfy the strong demand for securitized products, both mortgage lenders and those who 

packaged the loans for sale to investors were compensated primarily on the quantity of 

“product” they moved through the system.  As a result, they paid less attention to credit 

quality and many loans were made without sufficient documentation or care in 

underwriting.  Conflicts of interest at credit agencies, which were supposed to serve 

investors but had incentives to help issuers of securities obtain high credit ratings, are 

another example.   

Consistent with key aspects of research in information economics, the public 

policy responses to these problems have focused on improving market participants’ 

incentives.  For example, to address problems with compensation practices, the Federal 

Reserve, in conjunction with other supervisory agencies, has subjected compensation 

practices of banking institutions to supervisory review.  The interagency supervisory 

guidance supports compensation practices that induce employees to take a longer-term 

perspective, such as paying part of employees’ compensation in stock that vests based on 

sustained strong performance.  To ameliorate the problems with the originate-to-


-11- 
 

distribute model, recent legislation requires regulatory agencies, including the Federal 

Reserve, to develop new standards applicable to securitization activities that would better 

align the incentives faced by market participants involved in the various stages of the 

securitization process.7

Information economics and principal-agent theory are also essential to 

understanding the problems created by so-called too-big-to-fail financial institutions.  

Prior to the crisis, market participants believed that large, complex, and interconnected 

financial firms would not be allowed to fail during a financial crisis.  And, as you know, 

authorities both in the United States and abroad did in fact intervene on a number of 

occasions to prevent the failure of such firms--not out of any special consideration for the 

owners, managers, or creditors of these firms, but because of legitimate concerns about 

potential damage to the financial system and the broader economy.  However, although 

the instability caused by the failure or near-failure of some large firms did indeed prove 

very costly, in some sense the real damage was done before the crisis.  If creditors in 

  And the Securities and Exchange Commission has been charged 

with developing new rules to reduce conflicts of interest at credit rating agencies. 

                                                 
7 The requirements related to credit risk were contained in section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 
Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 111-203 (July 2010); with regard to compensation 
practices, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Federal Reserve Issues Proposed 
Guidance on Incentive Compensation,” press release, October 22, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20091022a.htm; also see Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2010), “Federal Reserve, OCC, OTS, FDIC Issue Final Guidance on Incentive 
Compensation,” joint press release, June 21, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20100621a.htm. 
 Why might government intervention be needed to improve private-sector incentives, when incentives 
presumably exist for the private-sector principals and agents to work out the best incentive structure for 
themselves?  The possibility of problems arising regarding collective action when a firm has many 
shareholders is one rationale.  The standard reason for intervening in banks’ risk-taking practices is the 
existence of deposit insurance, which itself distorts private risk-taking incentives by eliminating any 
incentive of depositors to monitor the activities of their bank; for an early discussion, see John Kareken and 
Neil Wallace (1978), “Deposit Insurance and Bank Regulation:  A Partial-Equilibrium Exposition,” 
Journal of Business, vol. 51 (July), pp. 413-38.  Indeed, the Federal Reserve invoked a “safety and 
soundness” rationale for its guidance on incentive compensation practices.  More generally, as the crisis 
revealed, bad incentives can lead to problems that affect not just the individuals involved but the broader 
financial system as well; such spillovers suggest that regulation can help improve outcomes. 
 


-12- 
 

good times believe that certain firms will not be allowed to fail, they will demand 

relatively little compensation for risk, thus weakening market discipline; in addition, 

creditors will not have much incentive to monitor the firms’ risk-taking.  As a result, as 

predicted by principal-agent theory, firms thought to be too big to fail tended to take on 

more risk, as they faced little pressure from investors and expected to receive assistance 

if their bets went bad.  This problem is an example of what economists refer to as moral 

hazard.  The resulting buildup of risk in too-big-to-fail firms increased the likelihood that 

a financial crisis would occur and worsened the crisis when it did occur. 

One response to excessive risk-taking is stronger oversight by regulators, and the 

recent legislation and the rules and procedures being developed by the Federal Reserve 

and other agencies will subject systemically critical firms to tougher regulatory 

requirements and stricter supervision.  The Federal Reserve has also been involved in 

international negotiations to raise the capital and liquidity that banks are required to hold.   

However, the problem of too-big-to-fail can only be eliminated when market participants 

believe authorities’ statements that they will not intervene to prevent failures.  If creditors 

believe that the government will not rescue firms when their bets go bad, then creditors 

will have more-appropriate incentives to price, monitor, and limit the risk-taking of the 

firms to which they lend.  The best way to achieve such credibility is to create 

institutional arrangements under which a failure can be allowed to occur without 

widespread collateral damage; if failures can take place more safely, the authorities will 

no longer have an incentive to try to avoid them.  The financial reform legislation took an 

important step in this direction by creating a resolution regime under which large, 

complex financial firms can be placed in receivership, but which also gives the 


-13- 
 

government the flexibility to take the actions needed to safeguard systemic stability.  This 

new regime should help restore market discipline by putting a greater burden on creditors 

and counterparties to monitor the risk-taking of large financial firms. 

The insights of economists proved valuable to policymakers in many other 

contexts as well:  in the setting and oversight of bank capital standards, in the decision to 

provide the market with extensive information gleaned during the bank stress tests in the 

spring of 2009, in the design of the Fed’s liquidity facilities for nondepository 

institutions, in the analysis of the collapse of the securitization market, and in the 

measures taken to protect consumers from deceptive or inappropriate lending, to name a 

few.  Many of the key ideas, like those of Thornton and Bagehot, were quite old, but 

some reflected relatively recent research.  For example, recent work on monetary policy 

helped the Federal Reserve provide further policy accommodation despite the constraints 

imposed by the zero lower bound on interest rates.8

Economics and Economic Research in the Wake of the Crisis 


Economic principles and research have been central to understanding and reacting 

to the crisis.  That said, the crisis and its lead up also challenged some important 

economic principles and research agendas.  I will briefly indicate some areas that, I 

believe, would benefit from more attention from the economics profession. 

                                                 
8The Federal Reserve did so by, for example, (1) acting rapidly when confronted with the zero lower 
bound, as discussed in David Reifschneider and John C. Williams (2000), “Three Lessons for Monetary 
Policy in a Low-Inflation Era,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 32 (November), pp. 936-66; (2) 
providing forward guidance regarding short-term interest rates, as discussed in Gauti Eggertsson and 
Michael Woodford (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest-Rates and Optimal Monetary Policy,” Brookings 
Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 2003 (1), pp. 139-211; and (3) expanding the Federal Reserve’s balance 
sheet through purchases of longer-term securities, as discussed in Ben S. Bernanke, Vincent R. Reinhart, 
and Brian P. Sack (2004), “Monetary Policy Alternatives at the Zero Bound:  An Empirical Assessment,” 
Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, vol. 2004 (2), pp. 1-78.

Most fundamentally, and perhaps most challenging for researchers, the crisis 

should motivate economists to think further about their modeling of human behavior.  

Most economic researchers continue to work within the classical paradigm that assumes 

rational, self-interested behavior and the maximization of “expected utility”--a 

framework based on a formal description of risky situations and a theory of individual 

choice that has been very useful through its integration of economics, statistics, and 

decision theory.9

The idea that, at certain times, decisionmakers simply cannot assign meaningful 

probabilities to alternative outcomes--indeed, cannot even think of all the possible 

outcomes--is known as Knightian uncertainty, after the economist Frank Knight who 

  An important assumption of that framework is that, in making 

decisions under uncertainty, economic agents can assign meaningful probabilities to 

alternative outcomes.  However, during the worst phase of the financial crisis, many 

economic actors--including investors, employers, and consumers--metaphorically threw 

up their hands and admitted that, given the extreme and, in some ways, unprecedented 

nature of the crisis, they did not know what they did not know.  Or, as Donald Rumsfeld 

might have put it, there were too many “unknown unknowns.”  The profound uncertainty 

associated with the “unknown unknowns” during the crisis resulted in panicky selling by 

investors, sharp cuts in payrolls by employers, and significant increases in households’ 

precautionary saving. 

                                                 
9 Herein I use the extension of Von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility, which focused on objective 
probabilities over risks, to situations in which individuals assign subjective probabilities over risks.  For a 
review of some classic contributions in this area, see Jacques H. Drèze (1974), “Axiomatic Theories of 
Choice, Cardinal Utility and Subjective Probability:  A Review,” in Jacques H. Drèze, ed., Allocation under 
Uncertainty:  Equilibrium and Optimality (London:  Macmillan), pp. 3-23.  Some authors have used risk to 
refer to a situation of objective probabilities and uncertainty to refer to a situation of subjective 
probabilities (see, for example, David M. Kreps (1990), A Course in Microeconomic Theory (Princeton, 
N.J.:  Princeton University Press)).  As highlighted below, others refer to uncertainty as a situation in which 
subjective probabilities cannot be assessed.  As this discussion makes clear, it is probably best to focus on 
the context in which the terms risk and uncertainty are used.

discussed the idea in the 1920s.  Although economists and psychologists have long 

recognized the challenges such ambiguity presents and have analyzed the distinction 

between risk aversion and ambiguity aversion, much of this work has been abstract and 

relatively little progress has been made in describing and predicting the behavior of 

human beings under circumstances in which their knowledge and experience provide 

little useful information.10

Another issue that clearly needs more attention is the formation and propagation 

of asset price bubbles.  Scholars did a great deal of work on bubbles after the collapse of 

the dot-com bubble a decade ago, much of it quite interesting, but the profession seems 

still quite far from consensus and from being able to provide useful advice to 

policymakers.  Much of the literature at this point addresses how bubbles persist and 

expand in circumstances where we would generally think they should not, such as when 

all agents know of the existence of a bubble or when sophisticated arbitrageurs operate in 

a market.  As it was put by my former colleague, Markus Brunnermeier, a scholar 

affiliated with the Bendheim center who has done important research on bubbles, “We do 

not have many convincing models that explain when and why bubbles start.”

  Research in this area could aid our understanding of crises 

and other extreme situations.  I suspect that progress will require careful empirical 

research with attention to psychological as well as economic factors.

understanding this process--and its implications for the household, business, and financial 

sectors--would be very helpful in the design of monetary and regulatory policies. 

Another issue brought to the fore by the crisis is the need to better understand the 

determinants of liquidity in financial markets.  The notion that financial assets can always 

be sold at prices close to their fundamental values is built into most economic analysis, 

and before the crisis, the liquidity of major markets was often taken for granted by 

financial market participants and regulators alike.  The crisis showed, however, that risk 

aversion, imperfect information, and market dynamics can scare away buyers and badly 

impair price discovery.  Market illiquidity also interacted with financial panic in 

dangerous ways.  Notably, a vicious circle sometimes developed in which investor 

concerns about the solvency of financial firms led to runs:  To obtain critically needed 

liquidity, firms were forced to sell assets quickly, but these “fire sales” drove down asset 

prices and reinforced investor concerns about the solvency of the firms.  Importantly, this 

dynamic contributed to the profound blurring of the distinction between illiquidity and 

insolvency during the crisis.  Studying liquidity and illiquidity is difficult because it 

requires going beyond standard models of market clearing to examine the motivations 

and interactions of buyers and sellers over time.12

I have been discussing needed research in microeconomics and financial 

economics but have not yet touched on macroeconomics.  Standard macroeconomic 

  However, with regulators prepared to 

impose new liquidity requirements on financial institutions and to require changes in the 

operations of key markets to ensure normal functioning in times of stress, new policy-

relevant research in this area would be most welcome.

models, such as the workhorse new-Keynesian model, did not predict the crisis, nor did 

they incorporate very easily the effects of financial instability. Do these failures of 

standard macroeconomic models mean that they are irrelevant or at least significantly 

flawed?  I think the answer is a qualified no.  Economic models are useful only in the 

context for which they are designed.  Most of the time, including during recessions, 

serious financial instability is not an issue.  The standard models were designed for these 

non-crisis periods, and they have proven quite useful in that context.  Notably, they were 

part of the intellectual framework that helped deliver low inflation and macroeconomic 

stability in most industrial countries during the two decades that began in the mid-1980s. 

That said, understanding the relationship between financial and economic stability 

in a macroeconomic context is a critical unfinished task for researchers.  Earlier work that 

attempted to incorporate credit and financial intermediation into the study of economic 

fluctuations and the transmission of monetary policy represents one possible starting 

point.  To give an example that I know particularly well, much of my own research as an 

academic (with coauthors such as Mark Gertler and Simon Gilchrist) focused on the role 

of financial factors in propagating and amplifying business cycles.  Gertler and Nobuhiro 

Kiyotaki have further developed that basic framework to look at the macroeconomic 

effects of financial crises.13

                                                 
13 See Mark Gertler and Nobuhiro Kiyotaki (forthcoming), Handbook of Monetary Economics; the paper is 
available at www.econ.nyu.edu/user/gertlerm/gertlerkiyotakiapril6d.pdf. 

  More generally, I am encouraged to see the large number of 

recent studies that have incorporated banking and credit creation in standard 

macroeconomic models, though most of this work is still some distance from capturing 


-18- 
 

the complex interactions of risk-taking, liquidity, and capital in our financial system and 

the implications of these factors for economic growth and stability.14

It would also be fruitful, I think, if “closed-economy” macroeconomists would 

look more carefully at the work of international economists on financial crises.  Drawing 

on the substantial experience in emerging market economies, international economists 

have examined the origins and economic effects of banking and currency crises in some 

detail.  They have also devoted considerable research to the international contagion of 

financial crises, a related topic that is of obvious relevance to our recent experience.   


Finally, macroeconomic modeling must accommodate the possibility of 

unconventional monetary policies, a number of which have been used during the crisis.  

Earlier work on this topic relied primarily on the example of Japan; now, a number of 

data points can be used.  For example, the experience of the United States and the United 

Kingdom with large-scale asset purchases could be explored to improve our 

understanding of the effects of such transactions on longer-term yields and how such 

effects can be incorporated into modern models of the term structure of interest rates.15

Conclusion 

I began my remarks by drawing the distinction between the scientific, 

engineering, and management aspects of economics.  For the most part, in my view, the 

financial crisis reflected problems in what I referred to as economic engineering and 

economic management.  Both private-sector arrangements (for example, for risk 

management and funding) and the financial regulatory framework were flawed in design 

and execution, and these weaknesses were the primary reasons that the financial crisis 

and its economic effects were so severe. 

Disasters require urgent action to prevent repetition.  Engineers seek to enhance 

the reliability of a complex machine through improvements in basic design; more-

rigorous testing and quality assurance; and increases in the resilience of the machine 

through means such as stronger materials, greater redundancy, and better backup systems.  

Economic policymakers’ efforts to avoid, or at least mitigate, future financial crises are 

proceeding along analogous lines.  First, the recent reform legislation has improved the 

design of the regulatory framework, closing important gaps such as the lack of oversight 

of the shadow banking system.  Likewise, in the private sector, firms have taken 

significant steps to improve their systems for managing risk and liquidity.  Second, to 

reduce the probability and severity of future crises, policymakers will monitor the system 

more intensively.  For example, the recent legislation creates a Financial Stability 

Oversight Council, made up of the heads of the financial regulatory agencies, which will 

assess potential risks to the financial system, identify regulatory gaps, and coordinate the 

efforts of the various agencies.  Enhanced market discipline, the result of a new 

resolution regime for systemically critical firms and a number of measures to increase 


-20- 
 

transparency, will complement regulatory oversight.  Finally, numerous steps, both 

prescribed in the legislation and taken independently by regulators, will work to make our 

financial system more resilient to shocks.  Examples include rules that will strengthen 

key financial utilities, toughen bank capital and liquidity standards, and require that more 

derivatives instruments be standardized and traded on exchanges rather than over the 

counter. 

Economic engineering is effective only in combination with good economic 

management.  For its part, the Federal Reserve has revamped its supervisory operations 

to provide more effective and comprehensive oversight.  In particular, we are taking an 

approach that is both more multi-disciplinary--making greater use of the Federal 

Reserve’s wide expertise in macroeconomics, finance, and other fields to complement the 

work of bank supervisors; and more macroprudential--that is, focused on risks to the 

system as a whole as well as those to individual institutions.  Together, better design of 

private- and public-sector frameworks for managing risk, better monitoring and 

supervision, and a more resilient financial system do not by any means guarantee that 

financial crises will not recur, but they should both reduce the risk of crises and mitigate 

the effects of any that do happen. 

  In short, the financial crisis did not discredit the usefulness of economic research 

and analysis by any means; indeed, both older and more recent ideas drawn from 

economic research have proved invaluable to policymakers attempting to diagnose and 

respond to the financial crisis.  However, the crisis has raised some important questions 

that are already occupying researchers and should continue to do so.  As I have discussed 

today, more work is needed on the behavior of economic agents in times of profound 


-21- 
 

uncertainty; on asset price bubbles and the determinants of market liquidity; and on the 

implications of financial factors, including financial instability, for macroeconomics and 

monetary policy.  Much of that work is already under way at the Bendheim center and in 

the Department of Economics here at Princeton.
