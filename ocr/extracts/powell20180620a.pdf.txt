Nine years into an expansion that has sometimes proceeded slowly, the U.S. 

economy is performing very well.  Growth is meaningfully above most estimates of its 

long-term trend--though admittedly, that trend is not as strong as we would like it to be.  

The labor market is particularly robust, with unemployment at its lowest level since April 

2000.  Inflation has moved up close to our 2 percent objective, although we have yet to 

see it remain near that objective on a sustained basis.   

Today, most Americans who want jobs can find them.  High demand for workers 

should support wage growth and labor force participation--the latter a measure on which 

the United States now lags most other advanced economies.1  A tight labor market may 

also lead businesses to invest more in technology and training, which should support 

productivity growth.  And groups such as some racial and ethnic minorities that still have 

higher unemployment and lower participation rates could see increasing benefits from a 

tight labor market.2  In short, there is a lot to like about low unemployment.    

Achieving our statutory goal of maximum employment in a context of price 

stability and financial stability is both our responsibility and our challenge.  Earlier in the 

expansion, as the economy recovered, the need for highly accommodative monetary 

policy was clear.  But with unemployment low and expected to decline further, inflation 

close to our objective, and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the case for 

continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate is strong.

labor markets.

Current Labor Market Conditions 

At 3.8 percent, the unemployment rate is below most estimates of its long-run 

level, which are now clustered in the mid-4s.  Many other labor market indicators also 

suggest an economy near full employment.  To name just a few, these indicators include 

an elevated level of job vacancies.  For the first time since the Labor Department began 

collecting the data in 2000, there are now more job vacancies than there are people 

counted as unemployed.  In addition, the rate at which workers are quitting their jobs is 

elevated, a sign that workers are able to find another job when they seek one.  And 

surveys show that businesses are finding it difficult to fill vacancies, and that households 

perceive jobs as plentiful.   

Some other indicators are less clear.  The labor force participation rate of prime-

age workers has moved up in recent years but remains below pre-crisis levels.3  In 

addition, wage growth has been moderate, consistent with low productivity growth but 

also an indication that the labor market is not excessively tight.    

Looking ahead, the job market is likely to strengthen further.  Real gross domestic 

product in the United States is now reported to have risen 2-3/4 percent over the past four 

quarters, well above most estimates of its long-run trend.  Expansionary fiscal policy is 

expected to add to aggregate demand over the next few years.  Many forecasters expect 

the unemployment rate to fall into the mid-3s and to remain there for an extended period.  

If that comes to pass, it will mean the lowest unemployment in the United States since the 

late 1960s. 

                                                 
3 The labor force participation rate is defined as the number of people either with a job or who have actively 
looked for work within the past four weeks, as a share of the total population.  Prime-age refers to 
individuals from 25 to 54 years old.

A historical comparison 

Because we have so little experience with very low unemployment, it is 

interesting to compare today’s labor market with that earlier period.  Unemployment was 

below 4 percent from February 1966 through January 1970.  During that time, inflation as 

measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures increased from 

below 2 percent in 1965 to about 5 percent in 1970.  In hindsight, unemployment is now 

widely thought to have been unsustainably low at that time and to have contributed to 

escalating inflation.   

But how significant is this precedent for today?  The U.S. economy has changed 

in many ways over the past 50 years.  By some estimates, the natural rate of 

unemployment is substantially lower now.4  For example, the Congressional Budget 

Office now estimates that the natural rate was about 5-3/4 percent (and rising) in the late 

1960s, compared with 4-3/4 percent at present.5   

Rising education levels do point to a decline in the natural rate since the 1960s, 

because more highly educated people are less likely to be unemployed.  The share of the 

population with a college degree has risen from less than 15 percent in the late 1960s to 

nearly 40 percent now, and the share with less than a high school degree has declined 

                                                 
4 The natural rate of unemployment is the unemployment rate over the longer term that is consistent with 
low and stable inflation.  It comprises both the “frictional” unemployment of people who are temporarily 
between jobs or searching as they have reentered the labor force and the more “structural” unemployment 
of people whose skills or physical location are not a good match for the jobs available.  For more 
discussion, see Janet L. Yellen (2017), “The Goals of Monetary Policy and How We Pursue Them,” speech 
delivered at the Commonwealth Club, San Francisco, January 18, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20170118a.htm. 
5 Contemporaneous estimates of the natural rate (or “full employment”) from the late 1960s were lower 
than current estimates for that period.  For example, the Economic Report of the President from 1968 
defined potential output as occurring when the unemployment rate is 4 percent.  See Executive Office of 
the President of the United States (1968), Economic Report of the President (Washington:  U.S. 
Government Printing Office, February), p. 61, http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/economic_reports/1968.pdf.

from 45 percent to about 5 percent.6  Another important difference from the 1960s is that 

inflation has been low and stable for an extended period, which has better anchored 

inflation expectations.  Today policymakers have a greater appreciation of the role 

expectations play in inflation dynamics and a clearer commitment to maintaining low and 

stable inflation.   

Unfortunately, with the passage of a half-century and important changes in the 

structure of our economy and in central bank practices, in my view the historical 

comparison does not shed as much light as we might have hoped. 

Questions prompted by a tight labor market 

The lack of useful historical precedent leaves us with some uncertainty about the 

answers to several important and challenging questions.  First, estimates of the natural 

rate of unemployment by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants and 

others have drifted lower as unemployment has declined without much apparent reaction 

from inflation.  How reliable are these estimates?  Natural rate estimates have always 

been uncertain, and may be even more so now as inflation has become less responsive to 

the unemployment rate.7  The anchoring of expectations is a welcome development and 

                                                 
6 Other changes in the workforce since the late 1960s seem less likely to have much affected the natural 
rate of unemployment.  There are many more women in the workforce now, but while women used to have 
higher unemployment rates than men, that is no longer the case.  And while younger workers tend to have 
less stable employment patterns and higher unemployment rates than older workers, the working 
population is, on net, only a little bit older now than it was in the late 1960s.  (The average age of people in 
the workforce declined through the 1970s as more of the baby-boom generation entered their working 
years, but it increased subsequently.)

the United States, see Olivier Blanchard, Eugenio Cerutti, and Lawrence Summers (2015), “Inflation and 
Activity--Two Explorations and Their Monetary Policy Implications,” in Inflation and Unemployment in 
Europe, proceedings of the 2015 ECB Forum on Central Banking (Sintra, Portugal:  European Central 
Bank), pp. 25-46, 
www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/ecbforumoncentralbanking2015en.pdf.  Regarding uncertainty about 
estimates of the natural rate, a classic reference is Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson 
(1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and

has likely played a role in flattening the Phillips curve.  But a flatter Phillips curve makes 

it harder to assess whether movements in inflation reflect the cyclical position of the 

economy or other influences.   

Second, what would be the consequences for inflation if unemployment were to 

run well below the natural rate for an extended period?  The flat Phillips curve suggests 

that the implications for inflation might not be large, although a very tight labor market 

could lead to larger, nonlinear effects.  Research on this question is ambiguous, again 

reflecting the limited historical experience.8  We should also remember that where 

inflation expectations are well anchored, it is likely because central banks have kept 

inflation under control.  If central banks were instead to try to exploit the 

nonresponsiveness of inflation to low unemployment and push resource utilization 

significantly and persistently past sustainable levels, the public might begin to question 

our commitment to low inflation, and expectations could come under upward pressure.  

So far, we see no signs of this.  If anything, some measures of longer-term inflation 

expectations in the United States have edged lower in recent years. 

Third, can persistently strong economic conditions pose financial stability risks?  

Of course, strong economic conditions are a good thing!  Such conditions can make the 

financial system better able to absorb shocks through strong balance sheets and investor 

confidence.  But we have often seen confidence become overconfidence and lead to 

excessive borrowing and risk-taking, leaving the financial system more vulnerable.

Indeed, the fact that the two most recent U.S. recessions stemmed principally from 

financial imbalances, not high inflation, highlights the importance of closely monitoring 

financial conditions.  Today I see U.S. financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate and 

broadly in line with their long-run averages.  While some asset prices are high by 

historical standards, I do not see broad signs of excessive borrowing or leverage.  In 

addition, banks have far greater levels of capital and liquidity than before the crisis.   

Fourth, while persistently strong economic conditions can pose risks to inflation 

and perhaps financial stability, we can also ask whether there may be lasting benefits.  As 

I mentioned, a tight labor market could draw more people into the labor force.  In fact, as 

the labor market has tightened, more workers have been moving back to work and off 

disability rolls.9  There could also be benefits to productivity and potential growth.  All 

told, though, the persistence of any such “positive hysteresis” benefits is uncertain, since, 

again, the historical evidence is sparse and inconclusive. 

Conclusion 

As is often the case, in the current environment, significant uncertainty attends the 

process of making monetary policy.  Today, with the economy strong and risks to the 

outlook balanced, the case for continued gradual increases in the federal funds rate 

remains strong and broadly supported among FOMC participants.
