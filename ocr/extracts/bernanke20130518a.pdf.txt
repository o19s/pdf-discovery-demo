Let me start by congratulating the graduates and their parents.  The word 

“graduate” comes from the Latin word for “step.”  Graduation from college is only one 

step on a journey, but it is an important one and well worth celebrating. 

I think everyone here appreciates what a special privilege each of you has enjoyed 

in attending a unique institution like Simon’s Rock.  It is, to my knowledge, the only 

“early college” in the United States; many of you came here after the 10th or 11th grade 

in search of a different educational experience.  And with only about 400 students on 

campus, I am sure each of you has felt yourself to be part of a close-knit community.  

Most important, though, you have completed a curriculum that emphasizes creativity and 

independent critical thinking, habits of mind that I am sure will stay with you. 

What’s so important about creativity and critical thinking?  There are many 

answers.  I am an economist, so I will answer by talking first about our economic future--

or your economic future, I should say, because each of you will have many years, I hope, 

to contribute to and benefit from an increasingly sophisticated, complex, and globalized 

economy.  My emphasis today will be on prospects for the long run.  In particular, I will 

be looking beyond the very real challenges of economic recovery that we face today--

challenges that I have every confidence we will overcome--to speak, for a change, about 

economic growth as measured in decades, not months or quarters. 

Many factors affect the development of the economy, notably among them a 

nation’s economic and political institutions, but over long periods probably the most 

important factor is the pace of scientific and technological progress.  Between the days of 

the Roman Empire and when the Industrial Revolution took hold in Europe, the standard 

of living of the average person throughout most of the world changed little from 


 - 2 -

generation to generation.  For centuries, many, if not most, people produced much of 

what they and their families consumed and never traveled far from where they were born.  

By the mid-1700s, however, growing scientific and technical knowledge was beginning 

to find commercial uses.  Since then, according to standard accounts, the world has 

experienced at least three major waves of technological innovation and its application.  

The first wave drove the growth of the early industrial era, which lasted from the mid-

1700s to the mid-1800s.  This period saw the invention of steam engines, cotton-spinning 

machines, and railroads.  These innovations, by introducing mechanization, 

specialization, and mass production, fundamentally changed how and where goods were 

produced and, in the process, greatly increased the productivity of workers and reduced 

the cost of basic consumer goods.  The second extended wave of invention coincided 

with the modern industrial era, which lasted from the mid-1800s well into the years after 

World War II.  This era featured multiple innovations that radically changed everyday 

life, such as indoor plumbing, the harnessing of electricity for use in homes and factories, 

the internal combustion engine, antibiotics, powered flight, telephones, radio, television, 

and many more.  The third era, whose roots go back at least to the 1940s but which began 

to enter the popular consciousness in the 1970s and 1980s, is defined by the information 

technology (IT) revolution, as well as fields like biotechnology that improvements in 

computing helped make possible.  Of course, the IT revolution is still going on and 

shaping our world today. 

Now here’s a question--in fact, a key question, I imagine, from your perspective.  

What does the future hold for the working lives of today’s graduates?  The economic 

implications of the first two waves of innovation, from the steam engine to the Boeing

747, were enormous.  These waves vastly expanded the range of available products and 

the efficiency with which they could be produced.  Indeed, according to the best available 

data, output per person in the United States increased by approximately 30 times between 

1700 and 1970 or so, growth that has resulted in multiple transformations of our economy 

and society.1  History suggests that economic prospects during the coming decades 

depend on whether the most recent revolution, the IT revolution, has economic effects of 

similar scale and scope as the previous two.  But will it?   

I must report that not everyone thinks so.  Indeed, some knowledgeable observers 

have recently made the case that the IT revolution, as important as it surely is, likely will 

not generate the transformative economic effects that flowed from the earlier 

technological revolutions.2  As a result, these observers argue, economic growth and 

change in coming decades likely will be noticeably slower than the pace to which 

Americans have become accustomed.  Such an outcome would have important social and 

political--as well as economic--consequences for our country and the world. 

This provocative assessment of our economic future has attracted plenty of 

attention among economists and others as well.  Does it make sense?  Here’s one way to 

think more concretely about the argument that the pessimists are making:  Fifty years 

ago, in 1963, I was a nine-year-old growing up in a middle-class home in a small town in 

South Carolina.  As a way of getting a handle on the recent pace of economic change, it’s

interesting to ask how my family’s everyday life back then differed from that of a typical 

family today.  Well, if I think about it, I could quickly come up with the Internet, 

cellphones, and microwave ovens as important conveniences that most of your families 

have today that my family lacked 50 years ago.  Health care has improved some since I 

was young; indeed, life expectancy at birth in the United States has risen from 70 years in 

1963 to 78 years today, although some of this improvement is probably due to better 

nutrition and generally higher levels of income rather than advances in medicine alone.  

Nevertheless, though my memory may be selective, it doesn’t seem to me that the 

differences in daily life between then and now are all that large.  Heating, air 

conditioning, cooking, and sanitation in my childhood were not all that different from 

today.  We had a dishwasher, a washing machine, and a dryer.  My family owned a 

comfortable car with air conditioning and a radio, and the experience of commercial 

flight was much like today but without the long security lines.  For entertainment, we did 

not have the Internet or video games, as I mentioned, but we had plenty of books, radio, 

musical recordings, and a color TV (although, I must acknowledge, the colors were 

garish and there were many fewer channels to choose from).   

The comparison of the world of 1963 with that of today suggests quite substantial 

but perhaps not transformative economic change since then.  But now let’s run this 

thought experiment back another 50 years, to 1913 (the year the Federal Reserve was 

created by the Congress, by the way), and compare how my grandparents and your great-

grandparents lived with how my family lived in 1963.  Life in 1913 was simply much 

harder for most Americans than it would be later in the century.  Many people worked 

long hours at dangerous, dirty, and exhausting jobs--up to 60 hours per week in

manufacturing, for example, and even more in agriculture.  Housework involved a great 

deal of drudgery; refrigerators, freezers, vacuum cleaners, electric stoves, and washing 

machines were not in general use, which should not be terribly surprising since most 

urban households, and virtually all rural households, were not yet wired for electricity.  In 

the entertainment sphere, Americans did not yet have access to commercial radio 

broadcasts and movies would be silent for another decade and a half.  Some people had 

telephones, but no long-distance service was available.  In transportation, in 1913 Henry 

Ford was just beginning the mass production of the Model T automobile, railroads were 

powered by steam, and regular commercial air travel was quite a few years away.  

Importantly, life expectancy at birth in 1913 was only 53 years, reflecting not only the 

state of medical science at the time--infection-fighting antibiotics and vaccines for many 

deadly diseases would not be developed for several more decades--but also deficiencies 

in sanitation and nutrition.  This was quite a different world than the one in which I grew 

up in 1963 or in which we live today. 

The purpose of these comparisons is to make concrete the argument made by 

some economists, that the economic and technological transformation of the past 50 

years, while significant, does not match the changes of the 50 years--or, for that matter, 

the 100 years--before that.  Extrapolating to the future, the conclusion some have drawn 

is that the sustainable pace of economic growth and change and the associated 

improvement in living standards will likely slow further, as our most recent technological 

revolution, in computers and IT, will not transform our lives as dramatically as previous 

revolutions have.

Well, that’s sort of depressing.  Is it true, then, as baseball player Yogi Berra said, 

that the future ain’t what it used to be?  Nobody really knows; as Berra also astutely 

observed, it’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.  But there are some 

good arguments on the other side of this debate.  

First, innovation, almost by definition, involves ideas that no one has yet had, 

which means that forecasts of future technological change can be, and often are, wildly 

wrong.  A safe prediction, I think, is that human innovation and creativity will continue; 

it is part of our very nature.  Another prediction, just as safe, is that people will 

nevertheless continue to forecast the end of innovation.  The famous British economist 

John Maynard Keynes observed as much in the midst of the Great Depression more than 

80 years ago.  He wrote then, “We are suffering just now from a bad attack of economic 

pessimism.  It is common to hear people say that the epoch of enormous economic 

progress which characterised the 19th century is over; that the rapid improvement in the 

standard of life is now going to slow down.”3  Sound familiar?  By the way, Keynes 

argued at that time that such a view was shortsighted and, in characterizing what he 

called “the economic possibilities for our grandchildren,” he predicted that income per 

person, adjusted for inflation, could rise as much as four to eight times by 2030.  His 

guess looks pretty good; income per person in the United States today is roughly six 

times what it was in 1930. 

Second, not only are scientific and technical innovation themselves inherently 

hard to predict, so are the long-run practical consequences of innovation for our economy 

and our daily lives.  Indeed, some would say that we are still in the early days of the IT

revolution; after all, computing speeds and memory have increased many times over in 

the 30-plus years since the first personal computers came on the market, and fields like 

biotechnology are also advancing rapidly.  Moreover, even as the basic technologies 

improve, the commercial applications of these technologies have arguably thus far only 

scratched the surface.  Consider, for example, the potential for IT and biotechnology to 

improve health care, one of the largest and most important sectors of our economy.  A 

strong case can be made that the modernization of health-care IT systems would lead to 

better-coordinated, more effective, and less costly patient care than we have today, 

including greater responsiveness of medical practice to the latest research findings.4  

Robots, lasers, and other advanced technologies are improving surgical outcomes, and 

artificial intelligence systems are being used to improve diagnoses and chart courses of 

treatment.  Perhaps even more revolutionary is the trend toward so-called personalized 

medicine, which would tailor medical treatments for each patient based on information 

drawn from that individual’s genetic code.  Taken together, such advances could lead to 

another jump in life expectancy and improved health at older ages.   

Other promising areas for the application of new technologies include the 

development of cleaner energy--for example, the harnessing of wind, wave, and solar 

power and the development of electric and hybrid vehicles--as well as potential further 

advances in communications and robotics.  I’m sure that I can’t imagine all of the 

possibilities, but historians of science have commented on our collective tendency to

Optimistic Perspective,” International Productivity Monitor, Spring, pp. 3-12.

overestimate the short-term effects of new technologies while underestimating their 

longer-term potential.5   

Finally, pessimists may be paying too little attention to the strength of the 

underlying economic and social forces that generate innovation in the modern world.  

Invention was once the province of the isolated scientist or tinkerer.  The transmission of 

new ideas and the adaptation of the best new insights to commercial uses were slow and 

erratic.  But all of that is changing radically.  We live on a planet that is becoming richer 

and more populous, and in which not only the most advanced economies but also large 

emerging market nations like China and India increasingly see their economic futures as 

tied to technological innovation.  In that context, the number of trained scientists and 

engineers is increasing rapidly, as are the resources for research being provided by 

universities, governments, and the private sector.  Moreover, because of the Internet and 

other advances in communications, collaboration and the exchange of ideas take place at 

high speed and with little regard for geographic distance.  For example, research papers 

are now disseminated and critiqued almost instantaneously rather than after publication in 

a journal several years after they are written.  And, importantly, as trade and globalization 

increase the size of the potential market for new products, the possible economic rewards 

for being first with an innovative product or process are growing rapidly.6  In short, both 

humanity’s capacity to innovate and the incentives to innovate are greater today than at 

any other time in history.

Well, what does all this have to do with creativity and critical thinking, which is 

where I started?  The history of technological innovation and economic development 

teaches us that change is the only constant.  During your working lives, you will have to 

reinvent yourselves many times.  Success and satisfaction will not come from mastering a 

fixed body of knowledge but from constant adaptation and creativity in a rapidly 

changing world.  Engaging with and applying new technologies will be a crucial part of 

that adaptation.  Your work here at Simon’s Rock, and the intellectual skills, creativity, 

and imagination that that work has fostered, are the best possible preparation for these 

challenges.  And while I have emphasized technological and scientific advances today, it 

is important to remember that the arts and humanities facilitate new and creative thinking 

as well, while helping us to draw meaning that goes beyond the purely material aspects of 

our lives.  I wish you the best in facing the difficult but exciting challenges that lie ahead.  

Congratulations.
