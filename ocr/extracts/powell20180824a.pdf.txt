Monetary Policy in a Changing Economy 




Remarks by

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at 


“Changing Market Structure and Implications for Monetary Policy,” a symposium 

sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City 


Jackson Hole, Wyoming  








August 24, 2018 




Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  Fifteen years ago, during the 

period now referred to as the Great Moderation, the topic of this symposium was 

“Adapting to a Changing Economy.”  In opening the proceedings, then-Chairman Alan 

Greenspan famously declared that “uncertainty is not just an important feature of the 

monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape.”1  On the 

doorstep of the period now referred to as the Global Financial Crisis, surely few, if any, 

at that symposium would have imagined how shockingly different the next 15 years 

would be from the 15 years that preceded it. 

Over the course of a long recovery, the U.S. economy has strengthened 

substantially.  The unemployment rate has declined steadily for almost nine years and, at 

3.9 percent, is now near a 20-year low.  Most people who want jobs can find 

them.  Inflation has moved up and is now near the Federal Open Market Committee’s 

(FOMC) objective of 2 percent after running generally below that level for six 

years.  With solid household and business confidence, healthy levels of job creation, 

rising incomes, and fiscal stimulus arriving, there is good reason to expect that this strong 

performance will continue.   

As the economy has strengthened, the FOMC has gradually raised the federal 

funds rate from its crisis-era low near zero toward more normal levels.  We are also 

allowing our securities holdings--assets acquired to support the economy during the deep 

recession and the long recovery--to decline gradually as these securities are paid off.  I 

will explain today why the Committee’s consensus view is that this gradual process of 

normalization remains appropriate.  As always, there are risk factors abroad and at home

that, in time, could demand a different policy response, but today I will step back from 

these. 

In keeping with the spirit of this year’s symposium topic--the changing structures 

of the economy--I would also note briefly that the U.S. economy faces a number of 

longer-term structural challenges that are mostly beyond the reach of monetary 

policy.  For example, real wages, particularly for medium- and low-income workers, have 

grown quite slowly in recent decades.  Economic mobility in the United States has 

declined and is now lower than in most other advanced economies.2  Addressing the 

federal budget deficit, which has long been on an unsustainable path, becomes 

increasingly important as a larger share of the population retires.  Finally, it is difficult to 

say when or whether the economy will break out of its low-productivity mode of the past 

decade or more, as it must if incomes are to rise meaningfully over time.   

My FOMC colleagues and I believe that we can best support progress on these 

longer-term issues by pursuing the Federal Reserve’s mandate and supporting continued 

economic growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent.  The topic of 

managing uncertainty in policymaking remains particularly salient.  I will focus today on 

one of the many facets of uncertainty discussed at the 2003 symposium--uncertainty 

around the location of important macroeconomic variables such as the natural rate of 

unemployment.  A good place to start is with two opposing questions that regularly arise 

in discussions of monetary policy both inside and outside the Fed:   

2 See Chetty and others (2014) and Chetty and others (2017). 


 - 3 - 

1.  With the unemployment rate well below estimates of its longer-term normal 

level, why isn’t the FOMC tightening monetary policy more sharply to head off 

overheating and inflation? 

2.  With no clear sign of an inflation problem, why is the FOMC tightening policy 

at all, at the risk of choking off job growth and continued expansion? 

These questions strike me as representing the two errors that the Committee is 

always seeking to avoid as expansions continue--moving too fast and needlessly 

shortening the expansion, versus moving too slowly and risking a destabilizing 

overheating.   As I will discuss, the job of avoiding these errors is made challenging today 

because the economy has been changing in ways that are difficult to detect and measure 

in real time.  I will first lay out a standard view of a handful of basic relationships that are 

thought to reflect key aspects of the underlying structure of the economy.   I will then use 

that framework to explain the role that structural change plays in our current policy 

deliberations, focusing on how that role has been shaped by two historical episodes.  

Conventional Views of Macroeconomic Structure 

In conventional models of the economy, major economic quantities such as 

inflation, unemployment, and the growth rate of gross domestic product (GDP) fluctuate 

around values that are considered “normal,” or “natural,” or “desired.”  The FOMC has 

chosen a 2 percent inflation objective as one of these desired values.  The other values are 

not directly observed, nor can they be chosen by anyone.  Instead, these values result 

from myriad interactions throughout the economy.  In the FOMC’s quarterly Summary of 

Economic Projections (SEP), participants state their individual views on the longer-run 


 - 4 - 

normal values for the growth rate of GDP, the unemployment rate, and the federal funds 

rate.   

These fundamental structural features of the economy are also known by more 

familiar names such as the “natural rate of unemployment” and “potential output 

growth.”  The longer-run federal funds rate minus long-run inflation is the “neutral real 

interest rate.”  At the Fed and elsewhere, analysts talk about these values so often that 

they have acquired shorthand names.  For example, u* (pronounced “u star”) is the 

natural rate of unemployment, r* (“r star”) is the neutral real rate of interest, and π* (“pi 

star”) is the inflation objective.  According to the conventional thinking, policymakers 

should navigate by these stars.3  In that sense, they are very much akin to celestial stars.     

For example, the famous Taylor rule calls for setting the federal funds rate based 

on where inflation and unemployment stand in relation to the stars.4  If inflation is higher 

than π*, raise the real federal funds rate relative to r*.  The higher real interest rate will, 

through various channels, tend to moderate spending by businesses and households, 

which will reduce upward pressure on prices and wages as the economy cools off.  In 

contrast, if the unemployment rate is above u*, lower the real federal funds rate relative 

to r*, which will stimulate spending and raise employment.     

Navigating by the stars can sound straightforward.  Guiding policy by the stars in 

practice, however, has been quite challenging of late because our best assessments of the 

location of the stars have been changing significantly.   

                                                 
3 In this talk, I will sidestep the issue of navigating by short-run versus long-run versions of the stars.  The 

challenges that I will highlight are, in my view, made more difficult, and the case for a careful risk-

management approach made stronger, by the need to consider both short-run and long-run versions of the 

stars.   
4 The original Taylor rule (Taylor, 1993) uses output relative to potential in place of unemployment relative 

to its natural rate.  Both forms are now known as Taylor rules.

Shifting Stars during Normalization     

In December 2013, the FOMC began winding down the final crisis-era asset 

purchase program.  Asset purchases declined to zero over 2014, and in December 2015, 

the FOMC began the gradual normalization of interest rates that continues to this day.  As 

normalization has proceeded, FOMC participants and many other private- and public-

sector analysts regularly adjusted their assessments of the stars (figure 1).  Many 

projections of the natural rate of unemployment fell roughly 1 full percentage point, as 

did assessments of the neutral interest rate.  Estimates of the potential growth rate of GDP 

slipped about 1/2 percentage point.   

These changing assessments have big implications.  For example, the 1 

percentage point fall in the neutral interest rate implies that the federal funds rate was 

considerably closer to its longer-run normal and, hence, that policy was less 

accommodative than thought at the beginning of normalization.  The 1 percentage point 

fall in the natural rate of unemployment implies at present that about 1.6 million more 

people would have jobs when unemployment is at its longer-run level.  These shifts in the 

stars generally reflect analysts’ attempts to square their estimates with arriving 

macroeconomic data.  For example, as the unemployment rate fell toward, and then 

below, estimates of its natural rate, many expected inflation to move up.  When inflation 

instead moved sideways, a reasonable inference was that the natural rate was lower than 

previously thought.  Further, over this period, GDP growth was slower than one might 

have expected based on the rapid decline in unemployment and the well-known 

relationship between output and unemployment known as Okun’s law.  Put another way, 

labor productivity growth consistently disappointed, which raised the question of whether 


 - 6 - 

that shortfall was temporary--perhaps due to headwinds from the crisis--or was part of a 

new normal.  

These assessments of the values of the stars are imprecise and subject to further 

revision.  To return to the nautical metaphor, the FOMC has been navigating between the 

shoals of overheating and premature tightening with only a hazy view of what seem to be 

shifting navigational guides.  Our approach to this challenge has been shaped by two 

much discussed historical episodes--the Great Inflation of the 1960s and 1970s and the 

“new economy” period of the late 1990s.  

Shifting Stars and the Great Inflation 

While the crisis and its aftermath have been extraordinary in many ways, the 

shifting of the stars is not one of them.  Figure 2 illustrates the Congressional Budget 

Office’s (CBO) current estimate of movements in the natural rate of unemployment and 

potential GDP growth from 1960 to 2000.5  Viewed against the ups and downs observed 

over these four decades, the recent shifts in longer-run values are not all that dramatic.  

Of course, these CBO estimates benefit from many years of hindsight, whereas monetary 

policy must be based on assessments made in real time.  The Great Inflation period 

vividly illustrates the difficulties this difference raises.  

Around 1965, the United States entered a period of high and volatile inflation that 

ended with inflation in double digits in the early 1980s.  Multiple factors, including 

monetary policy errors, contributed to the Great Inflation.  Many researchers have 

concluded that a key mistake was that monetary policymakers placed too much emphasis 

                                                 
5  I am using the CBO’s estimates to reflect a conventional view over that time span since the SEP longer-

run values have only been reported since 2009. 


 - 7 - 

on imprecise--and, as it turns out, overly optimistic--real-time estimates of the natural 

rate of unemployment.6     

Figure 3 compares the CBO’s current view of the natural rate of unemployment in 

that era with an estimate by Athanasios Orphanides and John Williams of the rate as 

policymakers perceived it in real time.  From 1965 to the early 1980s, this real-time 

estimate of u* was well below where hindsight now places it.  The unemployment rate 

over this period was generally well above the real-time natural rate, and contemporary 

documents reveal that policymakers were wary of pushing the unemployment rate even 

further above u* (figure 4, top panel).7  With the benefit of hindsight, we now think that, 

except for a few years in the mid-1970s, the labor market was tight and contributing to 

inflation’s rise (figure 4, lower panel).    

It is now clear that the FOMC had placed too much emphasis on its imprecise 

estimates of u* and too little emphasis on evidence of rising inflation expectations.  The 

Great Inflation did, however, prompt an “expectations revolution” in macroeconomic 

thinking, with one overwhelmingly important lesson for monetary policymakers:  

Anchoring longer-term inflation expectations is a vital precondition for reaching all other 

monetary policy goals.8 

When longer-term inflation expectations are anchored, unanticipated 

developments may push inflation up or down, but people expect that inflation will return 

fairly promptly to the desired value.  This is the key insight at the heart of the widespread 

                                                 
6 See, for example, Burns (1979), Orphanides and Williams (2013), and the sources therein.  Romer and 

Romer (2002) and Sargent (2002) debate additional factors that may have played a role.  There is no 

dispute, however, that policymakers did misperceive the natural unemployment rate, and Orphanides and 

Williams show that misperception of the natural rate of unemployment alone would have been sufficient on 

its own to generate outcomes like the Great Inflation. 
7 See the discussion in note 6.  
8 Many central bankers have made this case; see, for example, Bernanke (2007) and Yellen (2015).

adoption of inflation targeting by central banks in the wake of the Great Inflation.  

Anchored expectations give a central bank greater flexibility to stabilize both 

unemployment and inflation.  When a central bank acts to stimulate the economy to bring 

down unemployment, inflation might push above the bank’s inflation target.  With 

expectations anchored, people expect the central bank to pursue policies that bring 

inflation back down, and longer-term inflation expectations do not rise.  Thus, policy can 

be a bit more accommodative than if policymakers had to offset a rise in longer-term 

expectations.  

Shifting Stars and the “New Economy” of the Late 1990s 

The second half of the 1990s confronted policymakers with a situation that was in 

some ways the flipside of that in the Great Inflation.  In mid-1996, the unemployment 

rate was below the natural rate as perceived in real time, and many FOMC participants 

and others were forecasting growth above the economy’s potential.  Sentiment was 

building on the FOMC to raise the federal funds rate to head off the risk of rising 

inflation.9  But Chairman Greenspan had a hunch that the United States was experiencing 

the wonders of a “new economy” in which improved productivity growth would allow 

faster output growth and lower unemployment, without serious inflation risks.  

Greenspan argued that the FOMC should hold off on rate increases.   

Over the next two years, thanks to his considerable fortitude, Greenspan 

prevailed, and the FOMC raised the federal funds rate only once from mid-1996 through 

                                                 
9 This account is drawn from several accounts of the period:  Blinder and Yellen (2001), Blinder and Reis 

(2005), Meyer (1996), Meyer (2004), and the Federal Reserve’s Bluebook documents from June 1996 

through December 1998 (Board of Governors, various years). 


 - 9 - 

late 1998.10  Starting in 1996, the economy boomed and the unemployment rate fell, but, 

contrary to conventional wisdom at the time, inflation fell.11     

Once again, shifting stars help explain the performance of inflation, which many 

had seen as a puzzle.  Whereas during the Great Inflation period the real-time natural rate 

of unemployment had been well below our current-day assessment, in the new-economy 

period, this relation was reversed (figure 3).  The labor market looked to be tight and 

getting tighter in real time, but in retrospect, we estimate that there was slack in the labor 

market in 1996 and early 1997, and the labor market only tightened appreciably through 

1998 (figure 4).  Greenspan was also right that the potential growth rate had shifted up.  

With hindsight, we recognize today that higher potential growth could accommodate the 

very strong growth that actually materialized, let alone the moderate growth 

policymakers were forecasting.12  

The FOMC thus avoided the Great-Inflation-era mistake of overemphasizing 

imprecise estimates of the stars.  Under Chairman Greenspan’s leadership, the Committee 

converged on a risk-management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request:  

Let’s wait one more meeting; if there are clearer signs of inflation, we will commence 

tightening.13  Meeting after meeting, the Committee held off on rate increases while 

                                                 
10 In the second half of 1998, a Russian debt default and other ongoing financial instability in Asia 

intervened, and the FOMC rapidly lowered the federal funds rate 3/4 percentage point.  
11 By current data, over the eight quarters starting in 1996:Q3, core PCE (personal consumption 

expenditures) inflation fell from 1.8 percent to 1.3 percent. 
12 During this period, FOMC participants submitted six-quarter forecasts each July as part of the Fed’s 

semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  Each July from 1996 through 1998, the FOMC 

forecast growth very close to or above the real-time estimates of potential growth. The forecast growth is 

well below current estimates of potential output growth.  For the forecasts, see Board of Governors (1996, 

1997, 1998).

believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear.  And meeting after meeting, 

inflation gradually declined. 

In retrospect, it may seem odd that it took great fortitude to defend “let’s wait one 

more meeting,” given that inflation was low and falling.  Conventional wisdom at the 

time, however, still urged policymakers to respond preemptively to inflation risk--even 

when that risk was gleaned mainly from hazy, real-time assessments of the stars.  With 

the experience in the new-economy period, policymakers were beginning to appreciate 

that, with inflation expectations much better anchored than before, there was a smaller 

risk that an inflation uptick under Greenspan’s “wait and see” approach would become a 

significant problem.  

Risk Management in the Face of Shifting Stars 

Given what the economy has shown us over the past 15 years, the need for the 

sort of risk-management approach that originated in the new-economy era is clearer than 

ever before.  That approach continues to evolve based on experience and the growing 

literature on monetary policy and structural uncertainty.  

Experience has revealed two realities about the relation between inflation and 

unemployment, and these bear directly on the two questions I started with.  First, the stars 

are sometimes far from where we perceive them to be.  In particular, we now know that 

the level of the unemployment rate relative to our real-time estimate of u* will sometimes 

be a misleading indicator of the state of the economy or of future inflation.  Second, the 

reverse also seems to be true:  Inflation may no longer be the first or best indicator of a 

tight labor market and rising pressures on resource utilization.  Part of the reason inflation 

sends a weaker signal is undoubtedly the achievement of anchored inflation expectations 


 - 11 - 

and the related flattening of the Phillips curve.14  Whatever the cause, in the run-up to the 

past two recessions, destabilizing excesses appeared mainly in financial markets rather 

than in inflation.  Thus, risk management suggests looking beyond inflation for signs of 

excesses.    

These two realities present challenges.  The literature on uncertainty reviewed at 

the 2003 symposium--and much refined since then--provides important advice for how 

policy should respond, although not yet, in my view, an explicit recipe or rule that a 

prudent central bank should follow.15  The literature on robust rules, such as so-called 

difference rules, for example, supports the idea of putting less emphasis on the level of 

unemployment relative to u*.16  The FOMC’s practice of looking at a broad range of 

indicators when assessing the state of the labor market has explicitly been part of the 

FOMC’s Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy since its 

inception in 2012.17  We have greatly expanded the scope of our surveillance for signs of 

labor market tightness and of destabilizing excesses more generally. 

The risks from misperceiving the stars also now play a prominent role in the 

FOMC’s deliberations.  A paper by Federal Reserve Board staff is a recent example of a 

range of research that helps FOMC participants visualize and manage these risks.18  The 

research reports simulations of the economic outcomes that might result under various 

                                                 
14 Kiley (2015) reviews the literature on this point. 
15 The literature was reviewed by Walsh at the 2003 symposium; see Walsh (2003).  Also from the same 

symposium, see, for example, Greenspan (2003), Feldstein (2003), Fischer (2003), and Yellen (2003).  For 

a more recent perspective, see Wilkins (2017). 
16 See Taylor and Williams (2011).  Note that the robust rules literature does not suggest ignoring the 

general notion of labor market tightness or of resource utilization more generally.  Indeed, robust rules 

often reflect tightness through the change in the unemployment rate.  Instead, the issue is about how best to 

take account of labor market tightness when the best estimates of u* are very imprecise.  See also Erceg 

and others (2018).        
17 See Board of Governors (2018). 
18 See Erceg and others (2018). 


 - 12 - 

policy rules and policymaker misperceptions about the economy.  One general finding is 

that no single, simple approach to monetary policy is likely to be appropriate across a 

broad range of plausible scenarios.19   More concretely, simulations like these inform our 

risk management by assessing the likelihood that misperception would lead to adverse 

outcomes, such as inflation falling below zero or rising above 5 percent.   

Finally, the literature on structural uncertainty suggests some broader insights.  

This literature started with the work of William Brainard and the well-known Brainard 

principle, which recommends that when you are uncertain about the effects of your 

actions, you should move conservatively.20  In other words, when unsure of the potency 

of a medicine, start with a somewhat smaller dose.  As Brainard made clear, this is not a 

universal truth, and recent research highlights two particularly important cases in which 

doing too little comes with higher costs than doing too much.  The first case is when 

attempting to avoid severely adverse events such as a financial crisis or an extended 

period with interest rates at the effective lower bound.21  In such situations, the famous 

words “We will do whatever it takes” will likely be more effective than “We will take 

cautious steps toward doing whatever it takes.”  The second case is when inflation 

expectations threaten to become unanchored.  If expectations were to begin to drift, the 

reality or expectation of a weak initial response could exacerbate the problem.22  I am 

confident that the FOMC would resolutely “do whatever it takes” should inflation 

expectations drift materially up or down or should crisis again threaten.  In addition, a 

                                                 
19 The paper illustrates that some standard intuitions do not hold up in all circumstances.  When following a 

standard Taylor rule and facing a very flat Phillips curve, for example, it is not always good advice to lower 

the weight on the gap between unemployment and u* and to raise the weight on inflation in making policy.  

See Erceg and others (2018).

decade of regulatory reforms and private-sector advances have greatly increased the 

strength and resilience of the financial system, with the aim of reducing the likelihood 

that the inevitable financial shocks will become crises.    

The Current Situation  

Let me conclude by returning to the matter of navigating between the two risks I 

identified--moving too fast and needlessly shortening the expansion, versus moving too 

slowly and risking a destabilizing overheating.  Readers of the minutes of FOMC 

meetings and other communications will know that our discussions focus keenly on the 

relative salience of these risks.  The diversity of views on the FOMC is one of the great 

virtues of our system.  Despite differing views on these questions and others, we have a 

long institutional tradition of finding common ground in coalescing around a policy 

stance.   

I see the current path of gradually raising interest rates as the FOMC’s approach 

to taking seriously both of these risks.  While the unemployment rate is below the 

Committee’s estimate of the longer-run natural rate, estimates of this rate are quite 

uncertain.  The same is true of estimates of the neutral interest rate.  We therefore refer to 

many indicators when judging the degree of slack in the economy or the degree of 

accommodation in the current policy stance.  We are also aware that, over time, inflation 

has become much less responsive to changes in resource utilization.    

While inflation has recently moved up near 2 percent, we have seen no clear sign 

of an acceleration above 2 percent, and there does not seem to be an elevated risk of 

overheating.  This is good news, and we believe that this good news results in part from 

the ongoing normalization process, which has moved the stance of policy gradually 


 - 14 - 

closer to the FOMC’s rough assessment of neutral as the expansion has continued.  As 

the most recent FOMC statement indicates, if the strong growth in income and jobs 

continues, further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will 

likely be appropriate.  

The economy is strong.  Inflation is near our 2 percent objective, and most people 

who want a job are finding one.  My colleagues and I are carefully monitoring incoming 

data, and we are setting policy to do what monetary policy can do to support continued 

growth, a strong labor market, and inflation near 2 percent.

    Figure 1.  Real−Time Projections of Longer−Run Normal Values

     Note: The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) data are quarterly, extend through June 2018, and are projections of longer−term normal. The Blue Chip          
data are biannual, extend through June 2018, and are projections for 6 to 10 years in the future.  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) data are biannual and 
extend through August 2018. For the left two panels, the projections are for 10 years in the future; the right panel shows the natural rate projection for the current 
quarter at the time of the projection.  The neutral real interest rate is the three−month Treasury bill rate projection (Blue Chip and CBO) or the federal funds rate          
projection (FOMC) minus the source’s inflation projection. GDP is gross domestic product.

Economic Outlook) and Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (ALFRED).
     Correction: In the original figure, CBO potential output growth as of August 2018 was incorrectly reported; the value has been corrected to 1.8 percent.
