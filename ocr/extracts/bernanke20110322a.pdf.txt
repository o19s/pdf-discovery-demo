March 23, 2011




It’s a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak once again before the Independent 

Community Bankers of America (ICBA).  This is the sixth consecutive year that I’ve met with 

you at this event, and the themes of my remarks over the years tell a story not only about the 

financial and economic upheaval that we have all experienced, but also about some of the very 

difficult issues that continue to confront both bankers and policymakers today.  Back in 2006, 

less than two months after I started as Chairman, I spoke to you about the strong performance of 

community banks as well as about some important longer-term challenges.  In subsequent years, 

my remarks touched on the need to strengthen regulation and supervision of Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac, approaches to reducing preventable mortgage foreclosures, community banking 

and the financial crisis, and then last year, the need to address the problem of financial 

institutions that are “too big to fail.”  My themes today are the vital role that community banks 

need to play in the economic recovery, the value that the Federal Reserve places on insights from 

community banks, and the evolving regulatory environment. 

Community Banks and the Economic Recovery 

To me, the title of the 2009 ICBA annual report, Empowering Main Street, is a concise 

and accurate description of the critical role that community banks play in the U.S. economy.  

Community bankers live and work where they do business, and their institutions have deep roots, 

sometimes established over several generations.  They know their customers and the local 

economy.  Relationship banking is therefore at the core of community banking.  The largest 

banks typically rely heavily on statistical models to assess borrowers’ capital, collateral, and 

capacity to repay, and those approaches can add value, but banks whose headquarters and key 

decisionmakers are hundreds or thousands of miles away inevitably lack the in-depth local 

knowledge that community banks use to assess character and conditions when making credit

decisions.  This advantage for community banks is fundamental to their effectiveness and cannot 

be matched by models or algorithms, no matter how sophisticated.  The IBM computer program 

Watson may play a mean game of Jeopardy, but I would not trust it to judge the creditworthiness 

of a fledgling local business or to build longstanding personal relationships with customers and 

borrowers. 

Given the important role that community banks play in their local economies, we at the 

Federal Reserve are keenly interested in their health and their collective future.  Local 

communities, ranging from small towns to urban neighborhoods, are the foundation of the U.S. 

economy and communities need community banks to help them grow and prosper.  As I’m sure 

you are all too aware, the financial crisis and its aftermath have hit some community banks 

especially hard, and those institutions will continue to need time to repair their balance sheets.  

Although we are not yet where we would like to be, the good news is that many community 

banks are recovering and reporting stronger performance.   

Indeed, despite some of the worst economic conditions since the Great Depression and 

their own strained balance sheets, community banks have already been doing their part to meet 

the credit needs of their customers, notably including small business customers.  We have been 

spending a lot of time at the Federal Reserve trying to understand and promote lending to small 

businesses, and one of the interesting things we have found is that while small business lending 

contracted overall from mid-2008 through 2010, this contraction was not uniform.  In fact, a 

majority of the smallest banks (in this case, those with assets of $250 million or less) actually 

increased their small business lending during this period.  And while banks with assets between 

$250 million and $1 billion showed a slight decline in small business lending over this period, 

the contraction was not nearly as sharp as it was for the largest banks.  This hard evidence

underscores the important benefits of relationship banking, particularly in periods of unusual 

economic and financial stress. 

Community Banks and the Federal Reserve 

You may recall that in my remarks to this group last year, I noted that the decentralized 

structure of the Federal Reserve System, with 12 Reserve Banks and 24 branches located in cities 

across the country, was designed to ensure that local insights and information would be 

incorporated in the deliberations of both the Board and the Federal Open Market Committee.  

During the debates leading up to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act, we emphasized that our supervisory responsibility for state-chartered 

banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System and bank holding companies of all sizes 

not only provides valuable economic information at the grass-roots level that would be very 

difficult to replace, it also gives us a fuller picture of the nation’s financial system.  At the same 

time, the range of expertise that the Federal Reserve develops in making monetary policy and in 

its engagement with the financial system allows us to bring unique insights and value-added to 

our supervisory activities.  Fortunately, the Congress decided to preserve the Federal Reserve’s 

existing supervisory authority over smaller as well as larger banking organizations.  It also 

broadened the Federal Reserve’s connections to Main Street by adding hundreds of thrift holding 

companies to the institutions we supervise.  We are delighted that, through our supervision, our 

gathering of economic intelligence, and the activities of our community affairs departments 

around the country, we will be able to remain fully engaged with grass-roots America.   

 The Federal Reserve has undertaken several recent initiatives to enhance our interactions 

with community banks and ensure that we fully take their perspectives and unique characteristics 

into account in our policymaking.  First, for many years, the Board has had a committee of 




- 4 -

Governors that provides oversight on bank supervisory and regulatory matters.  Although many 

of this committee’s efforts in the wake of the financial crisis have understandably been focused 

on the largest and most complex banking organizations, the Board believes that it is important to 

sharpen our focus on smaller banking organizations as well.  As a result, we recently established 

a special supervision subcommittee that focuses on community banks and smaller regional 

institutions.  This subcommittee is chaired by a former longtime community banker, Governor 

Betsy Duke, and also includes a former state banking commissioner, Governor Sarah Bloom 

Raskin.   

The subcommittee provides leadership and oversight on a variety of matters related 

specifically to our supervision of community and smaller regional banks.1  In particular, the 

subcommittee is reviewing new policy proposals through the lens of the effect those proposals 

could have on smaller institutions, both in terms of safety and soundness and potential regulatory 

burden.  Among other things, the subcommittee also monitors the Federal Reserve’s working 

relationship with state banking supervisors, which is particularly important because we share 

with them supervisory responsibility for state member banks.   

We have also undertaken an initiative to solicit feedback from community banks on a 

more regular basis.  In October, the Board announced that it would form a Community 

Depository Institutions Advisory Council to provide insight and information on the economy, 

lending conditions, and other issues of interest to community banks.2  To make this council as 

representative as possible, each of the 12 Reserve Banks now has its own local advisory council 

comprising representatives from banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions; one member from 

                                                 
1 For supervisory purposes, the Federal Reserve generally considers banking organizations with assets of $10 billion 
or less to be community banking organizations and those with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion to be 
regional banking organizations. 
2 This group replaces the former Thrift Institution Advisory Council, which provided the Board with useful 
information from the perspective of thrift institutions and credit unions.

each local council serves on the national council that will meet with the Board twice a year in 

Washington.  Local meetings have already begun, and the first meeting of the national council 

with the Board will take place soon.  Personally, I am looking forward to hearing more from 

community bankers about issues ranging from their local economies to regulatory reform. 

Community Banks and Regulatory Reform 

As you know, a key challenge for community banks in the years ahead will be to adapt to 

the changing regulatory environment, particularly the regulatory reforms contained in the Dodd-

Frank Act, as well as the changes that will be associated with the Basel III reforms.  We are 

certainly aware of and appreciate the concerns that community banks have about these regulatory 

changes, and, as I have just described, we have stepped up our efforts to understand those 

concerns and to respond to them as appropriate.  I think it is worth emphasizing that the changes 

we will be seeing in the financial regulatory architecture are principally directed at our largest 

and most complex financial firms, including nonbanks.  Consequently, one benefit of the reforms 

should be the creation of a more level playing field for financial institutions of all sizes. 

Focusing reform on our largest, most complex financial firms makes sense.  The recent 

financial crisis highlighted the fact that some financial firms had grown so large, leveraged, and 

interconnected that their failure could pose a threat to overall financial stability.  The sudden 

collapses of major financial firms were among the most destabilizing events of the crisis.  The 

crisis also demonstrated the inadequacy of the existing framework for supervising, regulating, 

and otherwise constraining the risks of major financial firms as well as of the toolkit the 

government had at the time to manage their failure. 

As I discussed with you at last year’s meeting, a major thrust of the Dodd-Frank Act is 

addressing the too-big-to-fail problem and mitigating the threat to financial stability posed by 




- 6 -

systemically important financial firms.  The too-big-to-fail problem is a pernicious one that has a 

number of substantial harmful effects.  Critically, it reduces the incentives of shareholders, 

creditors, and counterparties of such firms to discipline excessive risk-taking.  And it produces 

competitive distortions by enabling firms with large systemic footprints to fund themselves more 

cheaply than other firms because of the implicit subsidy of too-big-to-fail status.  This 

competitive distortion is not only unfair to smaller firms and damaging to competition today, but 

it also spurs further growth by the largest firms and more consolidation and concentration in the 

financial industry.  A financial system dominated by too-big-to-fail firms cannot be a healthy 

financial system. 

The act addresses the too-big-to-fail problem with a multi-pronged approach.  Under it, 

we are developing more-stringent prudential standards for banking firms with assets greater than 

$50 billion and all nonbank financial firms designated as systemically important by the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council.  These more-stringent standards will include stronger capital and 

leverage requirements, liquidity requirements, and single-counterparty credit limits, as well as 

requirements to periodically produce resolution plans and conduct stress tests.  Our goal is to 

produce a well-integrated set of rules that meaningfully reduces the probability of failure of our 

largest, most complex financial firms and that minimizes the losses to the financial system and 

the economy if such a firm should fail.  In doing so, we aim to force these firms to take into 

account the costs that they impose on the broader financial system, soak up the implicit subsidy 

these firms enjoy due to market perceptions of their systemic importance, and give the firms 

regulatory incentives to shrink their systemic footprint.   

Complementing these efforts, the Federal Reserve has been working for some time with 

other regulatory agencies and central banks around the world to design and implement a stronger 




- 7 -

set of prudential requirements for large, internationally active banking firms.  These efforts 

include the agreements reached in December on the major elements of the new Basel III 

prudential framework for large, globally active banks.  Basel III should make the financial 

system more stable and reduce the likelihood of future financial crises by requiring large banks 

to hold more and better-quality capital and more-robust liquidity buffers.  A more stable 

financial system will benefit all banking institutions and, of course, our economy as a whole.  

We are working to adopt the Basel III framework in the United States in a timely manner. 

A central issue that we and the other banking agencies face in implementing Basel III in 

the United States is deciding how these capital rules will be applied for banks that are not 

systemic or internationally active.  We recognize the importance of striking the right balance 

between promoting safety and soundness throughout the banking system and keeping the 

compliance costs for smaller banking firms as low as possible.  Also, to minimize the impact of 

the new capital rules on credit availability while the global economy is still recovering, we and 

our international colleagues have agreed to allow long transition periods for the implementation 

of the new standards. 

In addition to stricter regulation and supervision of large financial firms, the Dodd-Frank 

Act places new checks on the growth by acquisition of our major financial firms.  It expands 

current restraints on acquisitions by bank holding companies to include a broader range of 

acquired firms (not just banks) and a broader range of liabilities (not just deposits).  This 

expansion reflects a financial system that has changed in important ways since 1994, when the 

Congress first adopted concentration limits for banks and bank holding companies.  

The act also imposes new restrictions on the capital markets activities of banking firms--

restrictions that will disproportionately affect the structure and profitability of the largest banking 




- 8 -

firms.  For example, the so-called Volcker rule will restrict the ability of banking firms to engage 

in proprietary trading of securities and derivatives and to invest in or sponsor private investment 

funds.    

Among the most important aspects of act are the measures that it authorizes to reduce the 

financial and economic effects of the failure of large firms.  A clear lesson of the past few years 

is that the government must not be forced to choose between bailing out a systemically important 

firm and having it fail in a disorderly and disruptive manner.  Instead, we need the tools to 

resolve a failing firm in a manner that preserves market discipline--by ensuring that shareholders 

and creditors incur losses and that culpable managers are replaced--and that at the same time 

cushions the broader financial system from the possibly destabilizing effects of the firm’s 

collapse.  Of course, such a framework has been in place for banks for several decades now, as 

you know.  The Dodd-Frank Act creates an analogous framework for systemically important 

nonbank financial firms, including bank holding companies.  Resolving a large, multinational 

financial firm safely will likely always be a difficult challenge, and a great deal of work remains 

to be done to make these new authorities fully effective.  Ultimately, though, these changes will 

mitigate moral hazard in our financial system by reducing expectations of government support 

by the creditors and counterparties of large firms.  Taken together, the measures I have described 

should give us a financial system that is safer, more efficient, and more equitable. 

In short, two key objectives of financial regulatory reform are, first, addressing the 

problems that emerged in the largest, most complex financial firms during the crisis and, second, 

creating a better balance with respect to regulation and oversight between banks and nonbank 

financial firms.  The Federal Reserve believes that these are the right goals for reform.  We are 

committed to working with the other U.S. financial regulatory agencies to implement the act and 




- 9 -

related reforms in a manner that both achieves the law’s key objectives and appropriately takes 

into account the risk profiles and business models of smaller banking firms, including 

community banks. 

Before I conclude my remarks, let me say a few words about the transfer of thrift holding 

company supervisory authority to the Federal Reserve.  We have been working closely with the 

Office of Thrift Supervision, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation to make this transfer as smooth as possible, and progress so far 

has been good.  The Federal Reserve believes that any company that controls a depository 

institution should be held to appropriate prudential standards, including those for capital, 

liquidity, and risk management.  As such, we intend to create an oversight regime for thrift 

holding companies that is consistent with, and is as rigorous as, the supervisory regime we apply 

to bank holding companies.  That said, we appreciate that thrift and bank holding companies 

differ in important ways, play different roles in our economy, and will remain governed by 

different statutes.  We will be mindful of these differences and of the unique characteristics of 

the thrift industry as we develop our supervisory approach to thrift holding companies. 

Conclusion 

My colleague, Governor Duke, recently told our examiners that “community bankers are 

creative, committed, stubborn, and resilient.”  I know she won’t mind my repeating that 

sentiment here, and I’m sure most of the community bankers in this room would wear those 

words as a badge of honor.  Community banks face substantial challenges in the months and 

years to come, including still-difficult economic conditions, continued uncertainties in real estate 

and other key markets, and a changing regulatory environment.  But community banks have 

faced difficult times before, and the industry has remained vibrant and resilient.  I am confident 




- 10 -

that community banking will successfully navigate these new challenges as well.  Thank you for 

what you do every day to meet the needs of your communities and to help our economy grow 

stronger.
