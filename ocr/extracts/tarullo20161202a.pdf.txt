Last summer, when I accepted President Loretta Mester’s invitation to speak at this 

conference, I thought it would be a good occasion to step back and assess where we stand in our 

post-crisis efforts to promote financial stability in the United States.  This morning I will offer 

such an assessment.  I will begin by reviewing what has been accomplished.  Then I will suggest 

how to approach the work that remains--including both tackling continuing vulnerabilities to 

financial stability and rationalizing the measures that have already been taken. 

The Crisis and Its Aftermath 

 To understand where we stand today, we should recall why we embarked on these efforts 

in the first place.  There is little mistaking the motivation--it was the magnitude of the 

destruction wrought by the financial crisis and the Great Recession that followed it.  The 

resulting losses in employment were on a scale not seen since the Great Depression.  One model 

used by Federal Reserve staff1 estimates that cumulative loss in output relative to potential over 

the period was on the order of one quarter of a year’s worth of economic output.2  While we 

cannot be certain that these losses were due solely to the financial crisis, losses of this magnitude 

appear broadly in line with estimates of the effects of prior financial crises.3  Moreover, the 

shortfalls in jobs and income relative to potential may understate the total losses, as many current 

                                                           
1 This estimate is from the FRB/US model, which is one model of the U.S. economy used by staff at the Federal 
Reserve Board.  For a description of the model and access to the data, see 
www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/frbus/us-models-package.htm.  
2 Losses attributable to the Great Recession have been estimated using different metrics and range widely.  For 
example, one 2013 study suggests that total U.S. losses from the financial crisis could range from 40 to 90 percent of 
a year’s worth of economic output, or $6 to $14 trillion.  Tyler Atkinson, David Luttrell, and Harvey Rosenblum

estimates of potential output are significantly below levels expected prior to the Great Recession. 

This may be due to the declines in investment, business dynamism, and labor force attachment 

brought about by the shortfall in aggregate demand through hysteresis effects.4   

 As evidenced by a continuing stream of scholarship, many factors contributed to the 

unsustainability and fragility of the pre-crisis financial system.  But the inadequacy of regulation 

and supervision was clearly among them.  Large banking firms had insufficient levels of high-

quality capital; excessive amounts of short-term, wholesale funding; too few high-quality, liquid 

assets; and inadequate risk measurement and management systems.  Systemically important 

nonbank financial firms whose failure could threaten the stability of the financial system were 

effectively outside the regulatory perimeter.  Governments did not have resolution regimes that 

could provide for an orderly resolution of a systemically important financial firm.  Shadow 

banking--which was funding long-term assets with short-term wholesale liabilities--exposed the 

financial system to a systemwide liquidity run. 

Although we all lived through the fall of 2008, let me dwell for a moment on that 

frightening period.  Six months had passed since the demise of Bear Stearns in March.  Over that 

summer, it may have appeared as though the fallout from this episode had been contained.  But 

by the fall, it became clear that other large, non-prudentially regulated financial firms threatened 

financial stability.  American International Group (AIG) received direct government support.  

Two large freestanding investment banks converted themselves into bank holding companies to 

gain market confidence from the imprimatur of regulatory oversight by the Federal Reserve.

Merrill Lynch and Bear Stearns itself ceased to exist as independent entities and were absorbed 

into existing bank holding companies, with some form of government benefit facilitating the 

acquisition.5  And, of course, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac teetered on the brink of failure, 

they were placed into government conservatorship, with accompanying full government 

guarantees of their liabilities.  The absence of an option for orderly resolution was faced head-on 

in the case of Lehman Brothers, whose bankruptcy in September moved the financial crisis to its 

most acute phase.   

Even insured depository institutions such as Wachovia and Washington Mutual, for 

which special resolution procedures were available, were merged into existing banks with, again, 

government benefits to make the absorption of these failing banks worthwhile for the acquiring 

institutions.6  And a number of very large bank holding companies were under grave stress.  

Meanwhile, financial markets of all sorts had either ceased functioning or come dangerously 

close to it.   

Unlike in some bank crises of the past, direct connections among large financial firms 

were only part of the problem.  At the heart of the crisis were contagion effects among firms 

holding similar assets--particularly, tradable assets--and the withdrawal of much of the short-

term wholesale funding on which many large financial firms and the shadow banking system had 

come to rely.  Needless to say, the larger the firm with lots of tradable assets and runnable 

funding, the greater the additional threat to the system.   

                                                           
5 In the case of JPMorgan’s acquisition of Bear Stearns, the Federal Reserve provided credit to support the 
transaction.  In the case of Bank of America’s acquisition of Merrill Lynch, Bank of America sought an arrangement 
that would ring fence any losses incurred by Merrill so as not to impose those losses on the parent company.  The 
Federal Reserve publicly announced its willingness to negotiate such an arrangement.  Although subsequent 
developments obviated the need for a ring fence arrangement, the public announcement was perceived as benefiting 
Bank of America during the period of extreme market uncertainty in late 2008. 
6 Wells Fargo benefited from a significant tax advantage in the Wachovia acquisition, while the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corporation agreed to share some losses in the Washington Mutual portfolio in order to facilitate its 
acquisition by JPMorgan.

If anyone harbored remaining doubts, it was clear by October that the nation’s financial 

system faced not just severe liquidity problems, but a solvency crisis.  In response, following 

enactment of the Troubled Asset Relief Program by Congress, Secretary Henry Paulson oversaw 

the injection of government capital into the nation’s largest financial firms, as well as into many 

smaller banking firms.  This first step toward stability was reinforced in early 2009 when 

Secretary Timothy Geithner initiated the stress test exercise to determine how much capital these 

firms needed to remain viable financial intermediaries and, perhaps as importantly, to share this 

information with markets.  In the succeeding months, the Federal Reserve obliged the firms to 

raise enough private capital to replace the government capital and to meet the minimum capital 

levels established by the stress tests. 

By the latter part of 2009, the U.S. financial system had been stabilized, but only with 

substantial injections of taxpayer capital and the complementary support of other guarantees and 

lending facilities variously provided by the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, and the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)--both to banks and to non-bank financial actors.  And the 

nation had meanwhile been plunged into the deepest economic downturn since the Great 

Depression.   

 Demands were widespread, both in the country and the Congress, for a regulatory 

response to protect against the reemergence of the conditions that had led to the crisis.  While 

there were different views on exactly what should be done, on how much new authority was 

needed for the regulators who had not fully exercised their existing powers, and on the degree to 

which regulators should be required--rather than just empowered--to take certain actions, there 

was agreement that action was needed.  Throughout 2009, discussion and debate ensued not just 

between, but within, the political parties on how best to respond.  If there was one powerful, 


5 
 

widely held view that underlay the public debate, it was that the system needed to change to 

avoid a repeat of the taxpayer bailouts of so many large financial institutions.     

It was only toward the end of the legislative exercise that resulted in the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) that the process took a more 

partisan turn.  Indeed, the Dodd-Frank Act contains measures that commanded fairly wide 

consensus, such as the need for higher capital requirements for the largest banks.  Furthermore, 

the origins of some features of the legislation rested as much or more with Republican than 

Democratic legislators, such as the section 165 requirement for resolution plans that will make 

systemically important firms resolvable in bankruptcy without requiring taxpayer support or 

resulting in major disorder in the financial system. 

The Nature and Impact of the New Regulatory Regime 

 Now let us fast forward to the present.  Less than a decade after being the epicenter of a 

global financial crisis, today the United States has the strongest and most diverse financial 

system of any major economy in the world.  Credit default swap (CDS) spreads and other market 

indicators suggest that investors have remained confident in the solvency of large U.S. banks 

through several recent episodes of global financial volatility.7  For example, during the market 

strains at the beginning of this year, the CDS spreads of U.S. banks increased only 25 to 50 basis 

points, and even so only briefly, while large banks in some other parts of the world saw their 

CDS spreads increase substantially more and for a longer period.  The relative strength of, and 

                                                           
7 Some have suggested that market-based measures of bank risk indicate that banks are not safer than before the 
crisis.  For example, CDS spreads are well above their levels in early 2006.  But this as likely suggests that investors 
were too sanguine in 2006 as that they believe there has been no change in bank safety since then.  And, as reflected 
in the changes made by credit ratings agencies in their assessment of implied support for banks from the 
government, markets may rightly perceive that the government is less likely now to bail out a bank that gets in 
trouble.  Moreover, equity prices may be down because some combination of economic conditions and regulation 
make profits likely to be lower than was expected and experienced in the unsustainable period leading up to the 
crisis.   


6 
 

resulting market confidence in, U.S. banks has allowed them to expand their lending, the growth 

of which has returned during the last couple of years to a pace similar to that in the pre-crisis, 

pre-bubble years.8 

 What accounts for this dramatic change in the position of the U.S. financial system?  

First, the crisis response by U.S. authorities was fairly quick and complete.  The resolute actions 

of the Bush Administration in late 2008 and the Obama Administration early in 2009 helped 

stabilize banks and begin their recovery in fairly short order.  Recapitalization proceeded 

quickly, even as the stress test compelled an early reckoning with actual and potential losses.  

The forceful monetary policy response, the liquidity programs of the Federal Reserve, and the 

FDIC’s guarantee of bank debt prevented the bottom from dropping out of the badly shaken 

financial system.  The emergency fiscal stimulus of 2009 helped prevent a downward spiral in 

the real economy from a Great Recession to another depression.  

Second, and of more relevance for the subject of this conference, was the regulatory 

reform program put in motion even before the crisis had ended.  This program has steadily 

strengthened the capital, liquidity, and risk management positions of large banks, with 

progressively more stringent measures applied to the most systemically important institutions. 

The new regulatory regime for large banks serves two important, complementary goals.  One is 

to ensure that the nation’s large financial institutions are sufficiently strong to continue to 

function effectively as intermediaries, lending to creditworthy businesses and households even in 

a period of substantial financial and economic stress.  If they cannot do so because, for example, 

their capital positions have been too weakened, the result could be a deepening of what may 

already be a serious recession.  The other goal is to address the too-big-to-fail problem.  When 

                                                           
8 Core loans grew at an average annual rate of about 7 percent from 1995 to 2004.  Core loan growth was 5.4 percent 
in 2014, 6.5 percent in 2015, and 7.1 percent thus far in 2016. 


7 
 

some combination of the size, functions, portfolios, and interconnectedness of a financial 

institution are such as to make authorities fear that its failure could endanger the entire financial 

system, they will be tempted to rescue the firm through direct capital injections or indirect 

measures to strengthen its solvency.  Knowing this, other market actors will be willing to lend to 

that institution at a premium lower than its actual risks would suggest is warranted, an effect that 

is particularly apparent during periods of stress.   

Taking both these goals into account, the regulatory regime must aim for much greater 

resiliency in the large banks than in smaller ones, so that they can continue to function even 

under serious stress without solvency assistance from the government and, thus, avoid causing 

more harm to the economy.  But the regime must also be able to contemplate failure by a very 

large bank--that is, to plan for the possibility that a larger bank may become insolvent 

notwithstanding much greater ex ante resiliency.  The regime must promote market discipline 

and offset the moral hazard that comes if a bank and its creditors believe the government will 

have no real choice but to bail the bank out. 

 Much has been accomplished in the last six or seven years to build a regime that 

advances both these goals.  I want to highlight four of its elements: capital, liquidity, risk 

management, and resolution planning.  Capital is, of course, central to ensuring resiliency 

although, as I will explain shortly, the presence or absence of other regulatory requirements is 

relevant in setting minimum capital levels.  Because no single capital measure can capture all 

possible sources of loss, U.S. banking regulation has for three decades required both a leverage 

ratio and a risk-based capital requirement.  In responding to the crisis, we have applied a higher 

leverage ratio and stronger risk-based capital requirements, including a robust stress testing 

program to larger banks.   


8 
 

The risk-based capital regime that has been built since the crisis contains several distinct 

components: a minimum capital requirement, a buffer requirement, and a surcharge on 

systemically important banks.9  Let me explain the rationale for each component.  The minimum 

capital requirement represents the amount of capital that experience suggests a bank needs so as 

to retain the confidence of its customers and counterparties and thus function as an intermediary.  

Recognizing that a bank operating below its minimum capital will be vulnerable to a sudden loss 

of market confidence, the regulatory consequences of falling below the minimum are severe and 

intended to force such a bank to quickly take steps to raise its capital level back above the 

minimum.  The buffer capital requirement is sized so that, if the economy suffers a severe 

recession that leads a bank to suffer a substantial loss, the bank will still be above its minimum 

capital level and thus able to continue operating and lending to support economic growth.  The 

buffer is intended to be useable in times of stress, and the regulatory consequences of falling into 

the buffer are accordingly less severe than the consequences of falling below the minimum.  The 

surcharge on systemically important banks requires systemically important firms to recognize, 

and hold capital against, the costs that their failure would impose on the broader economy. 

The minimum and buffer requirements were calibrated using historical data on bank 

losses across a number of countries in a way that would be appropriate for all large banks across 

a range of countries, although we recognized at the time that these requirements might not reflect 

market circumstances in all situations.  The surcharge for global systemically important banks 

(G-SIBs) was calibrated to provide a sufficient amount of additional capital to reduce sufficiently 

the chances of a G-SIB’s failure so that the impact of its failure, discounted by the probability of 

                                                           
9  In addition to increasing minimum capital ratios, post-crisis reforms also placed more emphasis on the quality of 
regulatory capital by introducing the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, which reflects the focus by bank investors 
and counterparties during the crisis on common equity. 


9 
 

that failure occurring, would approximately equal the impact of the failure of a large bank 

holding company that is not a G-SIB, discounted by the somewhat higher probability of its 

failure.10 

As I explained recently, we will soon consider adopting a “stress capital buffer” to 

integrate the post-crisis capital regime with our supervisory stress test.11  In this approach, each 

firm would have a buffer requirement derived from our annual stress test, taking the place of the 

existing buffer requirement, which is the same for all firms.  This change would make the capital 

regime more risk-sensitive by using firm-specific information on risks drawn from the stress test. 

Using the supervisory stress test to guide a risk-sensitive capital regime seems far preferable to 

reliance on a bank’s internal models, which have proven problematic as a basis for risk-based 

capital requirements under Basel II.12 

The progressive implementation of this capital regime has substantially increased the 

resiliency of the largest banks.  Although there can be reasonable differences over just how to 

compute minimum requirements, the post-crisis regime differs from pre-crisis days precisely 

because there is now a well thought through rationale for those much higher minimum 

requirements.  Because of this regime, banks subject to the annual supervisory stress test have to 

this point more than doubled their high-quality capital, while shedding many of their riskiest 

assets and activities.   

                                                           
10 The reason why the non-G-SIB’s probability of failure is higher is because its capital ratio requirement is lower 
without a surcharge.  For an explanation of this “expected impact” methodology, see Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System (2015), “Calibrating the G-SIB Surcharge,” white paper (Washington:  Board of Governors 
of the Federal Reserve System, July 20).

A second important feature of the post-crisis regulatory regime for large banks has been 

the introduction of quantitative liquidity regulations.  The financial crisis was, in the first 

instance, as much about liquidity as solvency.  What proved in retrospect to be excessive 

liquidity for some types of assets turned into scarcity nearly overnight, confirming the view that 

liquidity is most available when you need it least and least available when you need it most.  The 

period was defined by runs, not on bank deposits (at least not insured bank deposits), but on 

short-term wholesale funding.  Because of deep uncertainty about the condition of counterparties 

and the value of assets serving as collateral, investors refused to roll over existing repurchase 

agreements (or repos) and similar extensions of credit, much less to offer new lending.  Many 

trading activities ground to a near halt, and dealers were forced into fire sales of the assets on 

their balance sheets that remained liquid.  Indeed, it was difficult at times to distinguish between 

liquidity and solvency crises at particular firms. 

The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) have placed 

the funding of large banks on a firmer footing.  The LCR requires a large bank to hold enough 

high-quality liquid assets to cover the net cash outflows the bank would expect to occur over a 

30-day stress scenario.  This requirement establishes a buffer against liquidity risk that reduces 

the bank’s vulnerability to a run, such as materialized in the recent crisis.  In the event a bank 

does encounter liquidity difficulties, the LCR’s 30-day buffer will give the authorities time to 

assess the bank’s condition and react as appropriate. 

The NSFR complements the LCR by requiring an amount of stable funding that is 

tailored to the liquidity risk of a bank’s assets and liabilities, based on a one-year time horizon.  

The NSFR creates an incentive for banks to extend the maturity of their funding, making them 

more resilient to market stress.  To offset the risks of the short-term wholesale funding structures 


11 
 

that proved so dangerous in the recent crisis, the NSFR requires more stable funding for short-

term loans to financial firms. 

It is important to note how liquidity requirements also affect the capital needed by a bank, 

as can be illustrated by a simple, if admittedly improbable, example.  Assume two banks with 

exactly the same assets and the same amount of capital.  One funds those assets entirely through 

insured (sticky) deposits and longer-term debt, while the other funds its assets entirely through 

short-term uninsured deposits and repo borrowing.  Assume now that an external shock reduces 

the value of the assets dramatically, with lingering uncertainty as to whether the value will 

continue to drop.  It is readily apparent that the two large banks face very different risks, since 

the second bank’s funding will at best become more expensive and at worst decline or disappear.   

A sound regulatory regime will align the riskiness of the two banks more closely, by requiring 

the second bank to change its funding profile, increase its capital, or some combination of the 

two.  In fact, the LCR and NSFR would require more stability in funding at my second 

hypothetical bank, while one of the factors used to calculate the capital surcharge applicable to 

the largest banks is its relative reliance on runnable funding. 

I will not go into detail in explaining a third key factor of our post-crisis regulatory 

regime--the requirement for rigorous risk management at large banks.  But a brief example 

should make the point.  During the height of the crisis in the winter of 2009, as we were 

conducting the first stress test, we found that some of the largest banks were literally unable to 

determine in any reasonable time their aggregate exposures to particular counterparties and 

business lines across their varied operations.  That deficiency made it easier to understand how 

they could have gotten themselves in such trouble.  Because of the supervisory expectations for 

risk management in our annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) exercise, 


12 
 

the information and risk management systems of all banks have improved substantially, though 

work remains to be done at some of the largest banks. 

A fourth key element of the post-crisis regulatory regime is to develop credible options 

for resolution so that even one of the largest financial firms could be allowed to fail without 

bringing the financial system down.  Without such options, market discipline will remain 

lacking.  Moral hazard will lurk in the background, since market actors will doubt that a large 

institution would be allowed to fail.  Moreover, government officials must themselves have 

confidence in the viability of orderly resolution and bankruptcy procedures, or else during 

periods of high stress, they will be tempted to use some form of government help to keep the 

firm solvent.   

Next Steps 

While it is perhaps a bit soon for a full evaluation of the regulatory regime for large 

banks, several studies affirm its beneficial economic effects, particularly when the destructive 

impact of a financial crisis is taken into account.13  This assessment should obviously be adjusted 

as warranted by new studies and data.  But even as this work proceeds, we should continue to ask 

two questions.   

First, are we reasonably confident that the largest U.S. banks could weather a period of 

stress, and, in the more remote event they could not, that they would no longer present the

Hobson’s choice of disorderly failure endangering the entire financial system or some form of 

solvency bailout?  While they are strong relative to their peers in other major economies and 

have held up well during the few bouts of moderate financial stress we have experienced over the 

last several years, these firms have not yet faced a major financial challenge.  Second, should we 

adjust statutory or regulatory provisions that are not needed for, or are less efficient means for 

achieving, financial stability?  Let me offer some perspective on answering both questions, along 

with a handful of specific proposals.  

With respect to the first question, there is certainly room for discussion over the most 

suitable minimum capital standards for the most systemically important financial firms.  As I 

noted when we were deciding on the expected impact approach as the best available method for 

calibrating capital surcharges, there is no magic to that method.14  Indeed, even within that 

approach, we should be open to research that suggests new or improved ways to determine the 

relative systemic importance of firms.  However, I think it is important to have a methodology 

that is clearly explained and is based on the research that has been done.  Let me note in passing 

two points that can be drawn from that research.  First, there is work subsequent to the 

formulation of the Basel III capital standards suggesting that the costs of higher capital 

requirements may be somewhat lower, and the benefits broader, than previously thought.  

Second, however, the reduction in the probability of a financial crisis associated with increasing 

capital levels will begin to level off at some point, thereby creating diminishing benefits for 

tighter capital standards.15

Fund, March).  


14 
 

Moreover, as important as capital is to promoting systemic stability, it is not the only 

relevant consideration.  The relative presence or absence of other regulations that mitigate risk in 

banks should affect minimum capital levels.  To my mind, the most important of these are 

regulations limiting dependence of financial firms on runnable funding sources.16  If a firm is not 

vulnerable to runs, it is far more likely to weather a financial storm without resorting to fire sales 

or cutting off customers from credit, and thus far less likely to wreak havoc on the financial 

system. 

In short, I think it healthy that discussion continues over the right type and levels of 

capital requirements and, more generally, over whether we have the right mix of policies.  To 

that end, here are a few relatively near-term steps that we at the Federal Reserve can take to 

further advance financial stability goals.  First is to continue focused work on making the largest, 

most systemically important firms resolvable in order to minimize both moral hazard and any 

harm that may befall the economy if such a firm were to fail.  This means continued work by the 

Federal Reserve and the FDIC to require these firms to develop their resolution plans and, more 

importantly, modify their organizational structures and day-to-day practices such as liquidity 

management so as to enable an orderly resolution, should it become necessary.  Along these 

lines, I would hope that Congress will move forward with a set of changes to the bankruptcy 

code to facilitate the resolution of large financial firms and, thereby, limit the number of 

instances in which the government would need to use the Title II procedures of Dodd-Frank.  

In the very short term, we will also finalize our rule requiring the most systemically 

important firms to hold a sizeable amount of long-term debt, which would be available to the

FDIC or a bankruptcy judge for conversion into equity should the firm fail.  Note that this 

requirement is intended to prepare for the possibility that the firm fails despite all the measures 

we have taken to strengthen resiliency.  Having identifiable instruments for conversion that 

would survive the loss of most or all of the firm’s equity is necessary for a private 

recapitalization of the firm to be successful.   

A second step is to determine if we can develop metrics that would reflect a firm’s 

particular vulnerabilities to funding shocks, liquidity shocks, and fire sale dynamics in their 

needed capital as part of the annual stress test.17  These measures would directly take into 

account macroprudential concerns of financial system stability.  They might well counsel 

increased capital requirements for some of the largest banks. 

A third step is to take another look at the capital and liquidity positions of large U.S. 

branches of some foreign banks.  As has become apparent, the actual consolidated capital 

positions of some such banks can be difficult for us to discern when the bank uses internal 

models to compute its required regulatory capital.  It is critical to ensure that large U.S. branches 

of foreign banks do not create financial instability in the United States if their parents’ global 

positions come under stress. 

Although I have been focusing mostly on the risks to financial stability posed by the 

largest financial firms, I would not want to leave a discussion of future work without offering 

another reminder that they are not the only source of vulnerabilities.  The kinds of “shadow 

banking” that grew up around the private-label mortgage backed securities markets have largely 

disappeared, but other forms of runnable liabilities remain outside prudentially regulated 

institutions.  There is also good reason to believe that new forms of shadow banking will develop

in the future and, as I have explained at some length elsewhere, continued attention to such 

activities will be needed.18 

Turning now to an agenda for rationalizing what has already been done, I will not attempt 

to lay out a list of appropriate measures so much as to suggest some key considerations in 

forming such an agenda.   

First, it is critical that we not forget our still quite recent history.  Earlier in this talk I 

recounted the origins and effects of the financial crisis as a reminder as to why we now have the 

stronger capital requirements and other measures I have described.  There is surely a need to 

review over time the changes that have been implemented to assess how much additional 

stability we have gained and at what cost.  As we gain experience with the statutory and 

regulatory measures that have been implemented, we have begun assessments of the efficacy and 

efficiency of these measures.  Thus, for example, we are proposing to remove the qualitative 

assessment exercise in CCAR for most firms with less than $250 billion in assets.19  As part of 

our continuing examination of changes in market liquidity in the post-crisis period, we are 

assessing whether refinements might usefully be made in any of the regulations that have 

generally had beneficial effects in containing excessive and unsustainable liquidity.  And as part 

of our efforts to tailor our regulations according to the business models of firms, we are 

considering ways to address the special issues posed for the large custody banks by certain 

elements of our regulatory framework.  But in considering these and other changes, we will not 

weaken the essential elements of the existing regime that guard against another financial crisis.

Second--and here is an affirmative argument for rationalization measures--we need to 

have a more explicit and thorough tiering of requirements within the prudential regulatory 

regime.  The flip side of the observation that the largest banks need stricter and more wide-

ranging regulation because of the special risks they pose is that the smaller and less 

interconnected a bank is, the less risk it presents and thus the less strict its regulatory 

requirements need be.  The Dodd-Frank Act reflects this principle, not only in its mandate of 

progressively more stringent requirements as the systemic importance of a financial firm 

increases, but also in the asset-size thresholds it establishes for various new regulations.  

However, as I have noted in the past, I think these thresholds were set too low in places.20  For 

example, I would raise the threshold for enhanced prudential standards from its current $50 

billion level, perhaps to $100 billion.  And I would entirely exempt community banks--by which 

I mean those with less than $10 billion in assets--from some regulations, such as the Volcker rule 

and the incentive compensation rule. 

It is worth noting that the burden of these rules for small banks is often less in the 

substantive constraints they impose on bank activities than in the compliance costs they impose.  

Even with efforts by banking agencies to streamline implementing regulations for smaller banks, 

the relatively scarce compliance resources of those banks must still be directed towards assuring 

that no changes in substantive activities are needed and possibly documenting their compliance.  

Indeed, I would generalize this point to suggest that the smaller the bank, the greater the 

likelihood that a potential disconnect between costs and benefits of regulation is rooted in the 

disproportionate costs of exams, audits, and reporting.  So while I think it is worthwhile to 

continue, for example, efforts to simplify capital rules for small banks, the greater value for those 

                                                           
20 See, for example, Daniel K. Tarullo, “Rethinking the Aims of Prudential Regulation.”

banks may lie in efforts to streamline the number of rules that apply to them and to reduce the 

number of separate compliance exams and exercises to which they are subject.  While especially 

applicable to small banks, this point has broader application, as in our earlier-mentioned proposal 

to exempt most banks with less than $250 billion in assets from the qualitative component of our 

annual CCAR exercise. 

My third suggested consideration in rationalizing the regulatory regime is a caution 

against being excessively attracted to simple answers to a set of risks posed by complicated and 

diverse activities.  There is no question, in my mind at least, that regulations can become 

excessively complicated.  A prime example is the Basel II approach of basing banks’ capital 

requirements on their internal models.  It is exceedingly difficult and costly for supervisors to 

validate those models rigorously and, even so, the potential remains for intentional or 

unintentional mistakes that are hard to detect in a timely manner.  But this example does not 

mean that the simplest possible regulation is always optimal.   

Consider, in this regard, the idea of substituting a somewhat higher leverage ratio 

requirement for all other capital standards and many other regulatory requirements.  While this 

idea has a surface appeal, since the imposition of, say, a 10 percent leverage ratio on the current 

balance sheets of large banks would yield a very well-capitalized set of banks.  But one needs to 

look at the dynamic effects of such a requirement.  Since a higher leverage ratio would also make 

banks significantly less profitable, and with the constraints of risk-based capital and liquidity 

requirements lifted, they would be strongly incentivized to change the composition of their 

balance sheets dramatically, shedding safer assets like Treasuries in exchange for riskier but 

higher-yielding assets.  After all, with a leverage ratio as the only significant constraint, the 

regulatory cost of a short-term Treasury bill is identical to that of a junk bond.   


19 
 

Thus, to truly assure the safety and soundness of the financial system, a leverage ratio 

serving as the sole or dominant form of prudential regulation would probably have to be set 

considerably higher, at a level where the impact on financial intermediation could be quite 

extensive, particularly in what are today regarded as relatively safe capital market activities.  

Using both a leverage ratio and a strong set of risk-based capital requirements best combines the 

goals of safety and soundness, on the one hand, and efficient economic intermediation on the 

other.  We should remember that it was because of the limitations of a stand-alone leverage ratio 

that risk-based capital requirements were introduced in the 1980s. 

Conclusion 

 This conference is a good moment to remember just how bad things can be when 

financial stability is not effectively safeguarded and a financial crisis ensues.  It is, accordingly, 

also a good moment to caution against backsliding on the considerable progress that has been 

made toward a regulatory system that will provide just such a safeguard, particularly with respect 

to the largest, most systemically important banks.  While other modes of reform might have been 

taken, the one we have followed has provided a strong foundation for financial stability.  And, 

although I am sure some large banks would like to pare back our liquidity and risk management 

requirements or reduce required capital levels, both they and the economy have now largely 

adjusted to the new regime.  

After compelling banks in the depths of the crisis to raise capital sufficient to keep them 

at the minimum level necessary to function as effective intermediaries, we have since increased 

their resiliency through requirements to increase the quality and quantity of their capital.  But we 

have done so with a long transition period that allowed them mostly to build capital through 

retained earnings.  And we have generally left to the banks choices about reducing size or exiting 


20 
 

activities in response to the incentives created by regulations calibrated with credit and funding 

risks in mind.  Our stress test and CCAR exercises should ensure that the largest banks will not 

maintain distributions of capital to their shareholders in the face of rising financial stress, as they 

did in 2007 and 2008, which left them more vulnerable to the crisis. 

There are surely refinements that can be made to the regulatory regime that has emerged, 

particularly--though not exclusively--with respect to smaller banks that pose neither systemic nor 

macroprudential risks.  And, as I have suggested, there is surely a healthy debate to be had as to 

whether additional strengthening of resiliency measures is appropriate for the largest institutions.  

But I do not think there is a sound economic case for generally weakening the regulatory 

requirements applicable to the largest banks.  And I certainly do not think the taxpayers should 

bear the risk that would be entailed by any such weakening.
