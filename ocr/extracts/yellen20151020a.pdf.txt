We are here to honor two exceptional public servants and the great institution 

they helped build.  Let’s consider for a moment why the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 

has succeeded and how Carroll Wright and Janet Norwood contributed to that success. 

In 1884, a time of great strife and mistrust between management and labor, the 

federal government created an agency with the mission of providing detailed and 

objective information on American workers.  That task fell to Carroll Wright, who had 

won the confidence of workers and management as chief of the Massachusetts Bureau of 

Labor Statistics in the years after that state became the first to legalize labor unions.   

At that point, before the United States itself had recognized such rights and before 

the federal government could agree on labor standards, the public needed an 

unimpeachable assessment of the conditions faced by workers.  Under Carroll Wright, 

what was then called the Bureau of Labor investigated major labor disputes and issued 

reports that shaped public opinion and were the basis for executive action and legislation.  

He initiated the collection of data on hours, wages, and prices and was responsible for 

many important advances that successively improved the reliability of these data.  The 

respect for the thoroughness and objectivity of the research that Wright oversaw led to 

the dismantling of damaging trade barriers in the 1890s and later raised public awareness 

about the deplorable conditions faced by women in the workplace.   

In the U.S. Constitution, there is not a requirement that government statistics be 

accurate and free of political influence or bias.  Carroll Wright recognized that this 

simple, powerful idea could help build public confidence for the government’s effort to 

reduce conflicts between management and workers and move our nation forward.  He and 

others are responsible for a fundamental feature of our democracy that is now often taken

for granted--the public’s expectation and insistence that information provided by the 

government can be trusted.  To Carroll Wright’s descendants, one of whom is with us 

today, thank you, on his behalf, for this valuable contribution.   

This legacy lives on in the agency Carroll Wright founded, and few of his 

successors did as much to advance this principle as Janet Norwood.  One reason for this 

success, I am sure, is that she rose from the ranks, and the values of the BLS were deeply 

ingrained in her over the 28 years she served this agency.  Those who worked with Janet 

say she strongly believed the BLS was uniquely positioned to contribute to the economic 

policy debate as an authoritative, unimpeachable source of information and analysis 

about the economy.   

In her 13 years as commissioner, Janet succeeded in winning support for an 

ambitious expansion of the BLS.  She launched the annual Consumer Expenditure 

Survey, as well as many other important data series, and elevated the skills and quality of 

statistical analysis throughout the agency.  To supplement the traditional measurement of 

productivity as output per hour of labor, she oversaw the creation of a new measure of 

multifactor productivity in the private sector, estimating productivity as the result of both 

labor and capital inputs.  When budget pressures threatened to end important data series 

collected elsewhere at the Department of Labor, she found the means to continue these 

series at the BLS. 

At the same time, Janet faced challenges to the BLS’s tradition of professionalism 

and objectivity.  From 1979, when she was appointed by President Carter, to 1991, when 

she retired, the news on employment, productivity, and inflation was often bad.  In this

circumstance, the BLS was sometimes accused of overstating economic problems, and it 

occasionally came under pressure to alter the basis for its data.   

Janet Norwood fended off these challenges with a mixture of resolve and 

flexibility, channeling some of the pressure into deliberate and constructive processes that 

eventually yielded improvements in the consumer price index and generated alternative 

price measures.  As commissioner and like her predecessors, Janet helped preserve the 

BLS’s deserved reputation for accuracy and integrity by continually improving the 

design, procedures, and techniques of data collection. 

After government service, Janet had a long and active retirement in which she 

continued her contributions to the economic profession and the science of statistics.  She 

passed away on March 31 of this year.   

To members of her family who are with us today, thank you for her extraordinary 

service to our country.  Janet’s legacy continues in the ongoing work of the exceptional 

agency she helped build, on the foundation laid by Carroll Wright, whom she so 

appropriately joins today in this Hall of Honor.   

The Bureau of Labor Statistics is exceptional, and in that way, I hope it serves as 

an example of how effective, reliable, and trusted government can be.
