 Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be able to join the Economic Club of Indiana for 

lunch today.  I note that the mission of the club is “to promote an interest in, and 

enlighten its membership on, important governmental, economic and social issues.”  I 

hope my remarks today will meet that standard.  Before diving in, I’d like to thank my 

former colleague at the White House, Al Hubbard, for helping to make this event 

possible.  As the head of the National Economic Council under President Bush, Al had 

the difficult task of making sure that diverse perspectives on economic policy issues were 

given a fair hearing before recommendations went to the President.  Al had to be a 

combination of economist, political guru, diplomat, and traffic cop, and he handled it 

with great skill.  

My topic today is “Five Questions about the Federal Reserve and Monetary 

Policy.”  I have used a question-and-answer format in talks before, and I know from 

much experience that people are eager to know more about the Federal Reserve, what we 

do, and why we do it.  And that interest is even broader than one might think.  I’m a 

baseball fan, and I was excited to be invited to a recent batting practice of the playoff-

bound Washington Nationals.  I was introduced to one of the team’s star players, but 

before I could press my questions on some fine points of baseball strategy, he asked, “So, 

what’s the scoop on quantitative easing?”  So, for that player, for club members and 

guests here today, and for anyone else curious about the Federal Reserve and monetary 

policy, I will ask and answer these five questions: 

1. What are the Fed’s objectives, and how is it trying to meet them? 

2. What’s the relationship between the Fed’s monetary policy and the fiscal 

decisions of the Administration and the Congress?

3. What is the risk that the Fed’s accommodative monetary policy will lead to 

inflation? 

4. How does the Fed’s monetary policy affect savers and investors? 

5. How is the Federal Reserve held accountable in our democratic society? 

What Are the Fed’s Objectives, and How Is It Trying to Meet Them? 

 The first question on my list concerns the Federal Reserve’s objectives and the 

tools it has to try to meet them. 

As the nation’s central bank, the Federal Reserve is charged with promoting a 

healthy economy--broadly speaking, an economy with low unemployment, low and 

stable inflation, and a financial system that meets the economy’s needs for credit and 

other services and that is not itself a source of instability.  We pursue these goals through 

a variety of means.  Together with other federal supervisory agencies, we oversee banks 

and other financial institutions.  We monitor the financial system as a whole for possible 

risks to its stability.  We encourage financial and economic literacy, promote equal access 

to credit, and advance local economic development by working with communities, 

nonprofit organizations, and others around the country.  We also provide some basic 

services to the financial sector--for example, by processing payments and distributing 

currency and coin to banks.   

But today I want to focus on a role that is particularly identified with the Federal 

Reserve--the making of monetary policy.  The goals of monetary policy--maximum 

employment and price stability--are given to us by the Congress.  These goals mean, 

basically, that we would like to see as many Americans as possible who want jobs to 

have jobs, and that we aim to keep the rate of increase in consumer prices low and stable.

 In normal circumstances, the Federal Reserve implements monetary policy 

through its influence on short-term interest rates, which in turn affect other interest rates 

and asset prices.1  Generally, if economic weakness is the primary concern, the Fed acts 

to reduce interest rates, which supports the economy by inducing businesses to invest 

more in new capital goods and by leading households to spend more on houses, autos, 

and other goods and services.  Likewise, if the economy is overheating, the Fed can raise 

interest rates to help cool total demand and constrain inflationary pressures.   

Following this standard approach, the Fed cut short-term interest rates rapidly 

during the financial crisis, reducing them to nearly zero by the end of 2008--a time when 

the economy was contracting sharply.  At that point, however, we faced a real challenge:  

Once at zero, the short-term interest rate could not be cut further, so our traditional policy 

tool for dealing with economic weakness was no longer available.  Yet, with 

unemployment soaring, the economy and job market clearly needed more support.  

Central banks around the world found themselves in a similar predicament.  We asked 

ourselves, “What do we do now?” 

 To answer this question, we could draw on the experience of Japan, where short-

term interest rates have been near zero for many years, as well as a good deal of academic 

work.  Unable to reduce short-term interest rates further, we looked instead for ways to 

influence longer-term interest rates, which remained well above zero.  We reasoned that, 

as with traditional monetary policy, bringing down longer-term rates should support 

economic growth and employment by lowering the cost of borrowing to buy homes and

supply, and thus the cost, of short-term funding.

cars or to finance capital investments.  Since 2008, we’ve used two types of less-

traditional monetary policy tools to bring down longer-term rates.   

The first of these less-traditional tools involves the Fed purchasing longer-term 

securities on the open market--principally Treasury securities and mortgage-backed 

securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae and 

Freddie Mac.  The Fed’s purchases reduce the amount of longer-term securities held by 

investors and put downward pressure on the interest rates on those securities.  That 

downward pressure transmits to a wide range of interest rates that individuals and 

businesses pay.  For example, when the Fed first announced purchases of mortgage-

backed securities in late 2008, 30-year mortgage interest rates averaged a little above 

6 percent; today they average about 3-1/2 percent.  Lower mortgage rates are one reason 

for the improvement we have been seeing in the housing market, which in turn is 

benefiting the economy more broadly.  Other important interest rates, such as corporate 

bond rates and rates on auto loans, have also come down.  Lower interest rates also put 

upward pressure on the prices of assets, such as stocks and homes, providing further 

impetus to household and business spending. 

The second monetary policy tool we have been using involves communicating our 

expectations for how long the short-term interest rate will remain exceptionally low.  

Because the yield on, say, a five-year security embeds market expectations for the course 

of short-term rates over the next five years, convincing investors that we will keep the 

short-term rate low for a longer time can help to pull down market-determined longer-

term rates.  In sum, the Fed’s basic strategy for strengthening the economy--reducing 

interest rates and easing financial conditions more generally--is the same as it has always 


 - 5 -

been.  The difference is that, with the short-term interest rate nearly at zero, we have 

shifted to tools aimed at reducing longer-term interest rates more directly. 

 Last month, my colleagues and I used both tools--securities purchases and 

communications about our future actions--in a coordinated way to further support the 

recovery and the job market.  Why did we act?  Though the economy has been growing 

since mid-2009 and we expect it to continue to expand, it simply has not been growing 

fast enough recently to make significant progress in bringing down unemployment.  At 

8.1 percent, the unemployment rate is nearly unchanged since the beginning of the year 

and is well above normal levels.  While unemployment has been stubbornly high, our 

economy has enjoyed broad price stability for some time, and we expect inflation to 

remain low for the foreseeable future.  So the case seemed clear to most of my colleagues 

that we could do more to assist economic growth and the job market without 

compromising our goal of price stability. 

Specifically, what did we do?  On securities purchases, we announced that we 

would buy mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the government-sponsored 

enterprises at a rate of $40 billion per month.  Those purchases, along with the 

continuation of a previous program involving Treasury securities, mean we are buying 

$85 billion of longer-term securities per month through the end of the year.  We expect 

these purchases to put further downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, including 

mortgage rates.  To underline the Federal Reserve’s commitment to fostering a 

sustainable economic recovery, we said that we would continue securities purchases and 

employ other policy tools until the outlook for the job market improves substantially in a 

context of price stability. 


 - 6 -

In the category of communications policy, we also extended our estimate of how 

long we expect to keep the short-term interest rate at exceptionally low levels to at least 

mid-2015.  That doesn’t mean that we expect the economy to be weak through 2015.  

Rather, our message was that, so long as price stability is preserved, we will take care not 

to raise rates prematurely.  Specifically, we expect that a highly accommodative stance of 

monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economy 

strengthens.  We hope that, by clarifying our expectations about future policy, we can 

provide individuals, families, businesses, and financial markets greater confidence about 

the Federal Reserve’s commitment to promoting a sustainable recovery and that, as a 

result, they will become more willing to invest, hire and spend. 

Now, as I have said many times, monetary policy is no panacea.  It can be used to 

support stronger economic growth in situations in which, as today, the economy is not 

making full use of its resources, and it can foster a healthier economy in the longer term 

by maintaining low and stable inflation.  However, many other steps could be taken to 

strengthen our economy over time, such as putting the federal budget on a sustainable 

path, reforming the tax code, improving our educational system, supporting technological 

innovation, and expanding international trade.  Although monetary policy cannot cure the 

economy’s ills, particularly in today’s challenging circumstances, we do think it can 

provide meaningful help.  So we at the Federal Reserve are going to do what we can do 

and trust that others, in both the public and private sectors, will do what they can as well.

What’s the Relationship between Monetary Policy and Fiscal Policy? 
 
 That brings me to the second question:  What’s the relationship between monetary 

policy and fiscal policy?  To answer this question, it may help to begin with the more 

basic question of how monetary and fiscal policy differ.  

In short, monetary policy and fiscal policy involve quite different sets of actors, 

decisions, and tools.  Fiscal policy involves decisions about how much the government 

should spend, how much it should tax, and how much it should borrow.  At the federal 

level, those decisions are made by the Administration and the Congress.  Fiscal policy 

determines the size of the federal budget deficit, which is the difference between federal 

spending and revenues in a year.  Borrowing to finance budget deficits increases the 

government’s total outstanding debt. 

As I have discussed, monetary policy is the responsibility of the Federal Reserve--

or, more specifically, the Federal Open Market Committee, which includes members of 

the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors and presidents of Federal Reserve Banks.  

Unlike fiscal policy, monetary policy does not involve any taxation, transfer payments, or 

purchases of goods and services.  Instead, as I mentioned, monetary policy mainly 

involves the purchase and sale of securities.  The securities that the Fed purchases in the 

conduct of monetary policy are held in our portfolio and earn interest.  The great bulk of 

these interest earnings is sent to the Treasury, thereby helping reduce the government 

deficit.  In the past three years, the Fed remitted $200 billion to the federal government.  

Ultimately, the securities held by the Fed will mature or will be sold back into the market.  

So the odds are high that the purchase programs that the Fed has undertaken in support of 

the recovery will end up reducing, not increasing, the federal debt, both through the 


 - 8 -

interest earnings we send the Treasury and because a stronger economy tends to lead to 

higher tax revenues and reduced government spending (on unemployment benefits, for 

example). 

 Even though our activities are likely to result in a lower national debt over the 

long term, I sometimes hear the complaint that the Federal Reserve is enabling bad fiscal 

policy by keeping interest rates very low and thereby making it cheaper for the federal 

government to borrow.  I find this argument unpersuasive.  The responsibility for fiscal 

policy lies squarely with the Administration and the Congress.  At the Federal Reserve, 

we implement policy to promote maximum employment and price stability, as the law 

under which we operate requires.  Using monetary policy to try to influence the political 

debate on the budget would be highly inappropriate.  For what it’s worth, I think the 

strategy would also likely be ineffective:  Suppose, notwithstanding our legal mandate, 

the Federal Reserve were to raise interest rates for the purpose of making it more 

expensive for the government to borrow.  Such an action would substantially increase the 

deficit, not only because of higher interest rates, but also because the weaker recovery 

that would result from premature monetary tightening would further widen the gap 

between spending and revenues.  Would such a step lead to better fiscal outcomes?  It 

seems likely that a significant widening of the deficit--which would make the needed 

fiscal actions even more difficult and painful--would worsen rather than improve the 

prospects for a comprehensive fiscal solution. 

 I certainly don’t underestimate the challenges that fiscal policymakers face.  They 

must find ways to put the federal budget on a sustainable path, but not so abruptly as to 

endanger the economic recovery in the near term.  In particular, the Congress and the 


 - 9 -

Administration will soon have to address the so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of 

sharply higher taxes and reduced spending that is set to happen at the beginning of the 

year.  According to the Congressional Budget Office and virtually all other experts, if that 

were allowed to occur, it would likely throw the economy back into recession.  The 

Congress and the Administration will also have to raise the debt ceiling to prevent the 

Treasury from defaulting on its obligations, an outcome that would have extremely 

negative consequences for the country for years to come.  Achieving these fiscal goals 

would be even more difficult if monetary policy were not helping support the economic 

recovery. 

What Is the Risk that the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Will Lead to 
Inflation? 
 
 A third question, and an important one, is whether the Federal Reserve’s 

monetary policy will lead to higher inflation down the road.  In response, I will start by 

pointing out that the Federal Reserve’s price stability record is excellent, and we are fully 

committed to maintaining it.  Inflation has averaged close to 2 percent per year for 

several decades, and that’s about where it is today.  In particular, the low interest rate 

policies the Fed has been following for about five years now have not led to increased 

inflation.  Moreover, according to a variety of measures, the public’s expectations of 

inflation over the long run remain quite stable within the range that they have been for 

many years.  

With monetary policy being so accommodative now, though, it is not 

unreasonable to ask whether we are sowing the seeds of future inflation.  A related 

question I sometimes hear--which bears also on the relationship between monetary and 

fiscal policy, is this:  By buying securities, are you “monetizing the debt”--printing 


 - 10 -

money for the government to use--and will that inevitably lead to higher inflation?  No, 

that’s not what is happening, and that will not happen.  Monetizing the debt means using 

money creation as a permanent source of financing for government spending.  In contrast, 

we are acquiring Treasury securities on the open market and only on a temporary basis, 

with the goal of supporting the economic recovery through lower interest rates.  At the 

appropriate time, the Federal Reserve will gradually sell these securities or let them 

mature, as needed, to return its balance sheet to a more normal size.  Moreover, the way 

the Fed finances its securities purchases is by creating reserves in the banking system.  

Increased bank reserves held at the Fed don’t necessarily translate into more money or 

cash in circulation, and, indeed, broad measures of the supply of money have not grown 

especially quickly, on balance, over the past few years.  

For controlling inflation, the key question is whether the Federal Reserve has the 

policy tools to tighten monetary conditions at the appropriate time so as to prevent the 

emergence of inflationary pressures down the road.  I’m confident that we have the 

necessary tools to withdraw policy accommodation when needed, and that we can do so 

in a way that allows us to shrink our balance sheet in a deliberate and orderly way.  For 

example, the Fed can tighten policy, even if our balance sheet remains large, by 

increasing the interest rate we pay banks on reserve balances they deposit at the Fed.  

Because banks will not lend at rates lower than what they can earn at the Fed, such an 

action should serve to raise rates and tighten credit conditions more generally, preventing 

any tendency toward overheating in the economy. 

Of course, having effective tools is one thing; using them in a timely way, neither 

too early nor too late, is another.  Determining precisely the right time to “take away the 


 - 11 -

punch bowl” is always a challenge for central bankers, but that is true whether they are 

using traditional or nontraditional policy tools.  I can assure you that my colleagues and I 

will carefully consider how best to foster both of our mandated objectives, maximum 

employment and price stability, when the time comes to make these decisions. 

How Does the Fed’s Monetary Policy Affect Savers and Investors? 
 
 The concern about possible inflation is a concern about the future.  One concern 

in the here and now is about the effect of low interest rates on savers and investors.  My 

colleagues and I know that people who rely on investments that pay a fixed interest rate, 

such as certificates of deposit, are receiving very low returns, a situation that has involved 

significant hardship for some. 

However, I would encourage you to remember that the current low levels of 

interest rates, while in the first instance a reflection of the Federal Reserve’s monetary 

policy, are in a larger sense the result of the recent financial crisis, the worst shock to this 

nation’s financial system since the 1930s.  Interest rates are low throughout the developed 

world, except in countries experiencing fiscal crises, as central banks and other 

policymakers try to cope with continuing financial strains and weak economic conditions. 

A second observation is that savers often wear many economic hats.  Many savers 

are also homeowners; indeed, a family’s home may be its most important financial asset.  

Many savers are working, or would like to be.  Some savers own businesses, and--

through pension funds and 401(k) accounts--they often own stocks and other assets.  The 

crisis and recession have led to very low interest rates, it is true, but these events have 

also destroyed jobs, hamstrung economic growth, and led to sharp declines in the values 

of many homes and businesses.  What can be done to address all of these concerns 


 - 12 -

simultaneously?  The best and most comprehensive solution is to find ways to a stronger 

economy.  Only a strong economy can create higher asset values and sustainably good 

returns for savers.  And only a strong economy will allow people who need jobs to find 

them.  Without a job, it is difficult to save for retirement or to buy a home or to pay for an 

education, irrespective of the current level of interest rates. 

The way for the Fed to support a return to a strong economy is by maintaining 

monetary accommodation, which requires low interest rates for a time.  If, in contrast, the 

Fed were to raise rates now, before the economic recovery is fully entrenched, house 

prices might resume declines, the values of businesses large and small would drop, and, 

critically, unemployment would likely start to rise again.  Such outcomes would 

ultimately not be good for savers or anyone else.  

How Is the Federal Reserve Held Accountable in a Democratic Society? 
 
 I will turn, finally, to the question of how the Federal Reserve is held accountable 

in a democratic society.  

The Federal Reserve was created by the Congress, now almost a century ago.  In 

the Federal Reserve Act and subsequent legislation, the Congress laid out the central 

bank’s goals and powers, and the Fed is responsible to the Congress for meeting its 

mandated objectives, including fostering maximum employment and price stability.  At 

the same time, the Congress wisely designed the Federal Reserve to be insulated from 

short-term political pressures.  For example, members of the Federal Reserve Board are 

appointed to staggered, 14-year terms, with the result that some members may serve 

through several Administrations.  Research and practical experience have established that 

freeing the central bank from short-term political pressures leads to better monetary 


 - 13 -

policy because it allows policymakers to focus on what is best for the economy in the 

longer run, independently of near-term electoral or partisan concerns.  All of the 

members of the Federal Open Market Committee take this principle very seriously and 

strive always to make monetary policy decisions based solely on factual evidence and 

careful analysis.  

It is important to keep politics out of monetary policy decisions, but it is equally 

important, in a democracy, for those decisions--and, indeed, all of the Federal Reserve’s 

decisions and actions--to be undertaken in a strong framework of accountability and 

transparency.  The American people have a right to know how the Federal Reserve is 

carrying out its responsibilities and how we are using taxpayer resources.   

One of my principal objectives as Chairman has been to make monetary policy at 

the Federal Reserve as transparent as possible.  We promote policy transparency in many 

ways.  For example, the Federal Open Market Committee explains the reasons for its 

policy decisions in a statement released after each regularly scheduled meeting, and three 

weeks later we publish minutes with a detailed summary of the meeting discussion.  The 

Committee also publishes quarterly economic projections with information about where 

we anticipate both policy and the economy will be headed over the next several years.  I 

hold news conferences four times a year and testify often before congressional 

committees, including twice-yearly appearances that are specifically designated for the 

purpose of my presenting a comprehensive monetary policy report to the Congress.  My 

colleagues and I frequently deliver speeches, such as this one, in towns and cities across 

the country.   


 - 14 -

The Federal Reserve is also very open about its finances and operations.  The 

Federal Reserve Act requires the Federal Reserve to report annually on its operations and 

to publish its balance sheet weekly.  Similarly, under the financial reform law enacted 

after the financial crisis, we publicly report in detail on our lending programs and 

securities purchases, including the identities of borrowers and counterparties, amounts 

lent or purchased, and other information, such as collateral accepted.  In late 2010, we 

posted detailed information on our public website about more than 21,000 individual 

credit and other transactions conducted to stabilize markets during the financial crisis.  

And, just last Friday, we posted the first in an ongoing series of quarterly reports 

providing a great deal of information on individual discount window loans and securities 

transactions.  The Federal Reserve’s financial statement is audited by an independent, 

outside accounting firm, and an independent Inspector General has wide powers to 

review actions taken by the Board.  Importantly, the Government Accountability Office 

(GAO) has the ability to--and does--oversee the efficiency and integrity of all of our 

operations, including our financial controls and governance.    

While the GAO has access to all aspects of the Fed’s operations and is free to 

criticize or make recommendations, there is one important exception:  monetary 

policymaking.  In the 1970s, the Congress deliberately excluded monetary policy 

deliberations, decisions, and actions from the scope of GAO reviews.  In doing so, the 

Congress carefully balanced the need for democratic accountability with the benefits that 

flow from keeping monetary policy free from short-term political pressures. 

However, there have been recent proposals to expand the authority of the GAO 

over the Federal Reserve to include reviews of monetary policy decisions.  Because the 


 - 15 -

GAO is the investigative arm of the Congress and GAO reviews may be initiated at the 

request of members of the Congress, these reviews (or the prospect of reviews) of 

individual policy decisions could be seen, with good reason, as efforts to bring political 

pressure to bear on monetary policymakers.  A perceived politicization of monetary 

policy would reduce public confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to make its 

policy decisions based strictly on what is good for the economy in the longer term.  

Balancing the need for accountability against the goal of insulating monetary policy from 

short-term political pressure is very important, and I believe that the Congress had it right 

in the 1970s when it explicitly chose to protect monetary policy decisionmaking from the 

possibility of politically motivated reviews. 

Conclusion 
 

In conclusion, I will simply note that these past few years have been a difficult 

time for the nation and the economy.  For its part, the Federal Reserve has also been 

tested by unprecedented challenges.  As we approach next year’s 100th anniversary of the 

signing of the Federal Reserve Act, however, I have great confidence in the institution.  

In particular, I would like to recognize the skill, professionalism, and dedication of the 

employees of the Federal Reserve System.  They work tirelessly to serve the public 

interest and to promote prosperity for people and businesses across America.  The Fed’s 

policy choices can always be debated, but the quality and commitment of the Federal 

Reserve as a public institution is second to none, and I am proud to lead it. 

 Now that I’ve answered questions that I’ve posed to myself, I’d be happy to 

respond to yours.
