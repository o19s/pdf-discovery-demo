Good morning.  I appreciate this opportunity to meet with you today.  

I am pleased to see that my parents are in the audience.  I credit my parents with a 

lot, especially with promoting a strong work ethic in our family that taught us the 

fundamentals of a market economy.  From a tender age, my brother and I had a series of 

unusual jobs.  For example, Kenneth gave French horn lessons.  He was  about 13 years 

old at the time, so our parents would not permit him to charge more than $1.25 per hour.  

Kenneth had four students.  My mother permitted him to use the living room for lessons, 

as long as his students took off their muddy shoes at the door, so Kenneth had no 

overhead expenses and was both grossing and netting about $5.00 per week.  Given the 

scarcity of French horn teachers in our neighborhood, Kenneth had a monopoly in the 

French horn market.  So long as the local high school bands produced a steady stream of 

French horn players, Kenneth was assured that his services would be in demand.    

I had an even less lucrative job that involved truly unskilled labor.  I numbered 

pages.  My father, who was in the publishing business, would, in the days before word 

processing, bring home book manuscripts that did not have page numbers on them.  

These manuscripts needed to be numbered, and that’s where I entered the market, so to 

speak.  My father came up with the idea of paying me to number the manuscript pages.  

The rate he set for me was one cent--and that was not one cent per page, but one cent per 

two pages.  Needless to say, this wage was really too low for me, and I wanted to go on 

strike, but I was only 10 years old.  By the time I became a teenager, and it occurred to 

me that I could strike, I had been displaced by the progress of technology--specifically, 

word processors with automatic numbering options--which reduced my bargaining power 


 - 2 - 

to, well, nothing.  I could talk more about this particular job--noting the fact that even at 

the age of 10 I found this job to qualify as one of the most tedious known to mankind. 

I knew as a kid, however, that in order to buy a ticket to go to the movies with my 

friends, I was going to have to number around 400 pages, and if I did more pages than 

that and invested the money in a savings account at a bank at a compounded annual 

interest rate of 4-1/2 percent, I could eventually afford to buy some popcorn, too.  Or take 

a brief vacation from numbering.  But if I wanted to cut back the number of pages and 

still accumulate enough to go to the movies sometime, I would need to find an interest 

rate out there for my earnings of three or more times what the bank was offering--not 

likely for a very young investor with limited funds.  I share these stories to illustrate that I 

grew up with a keen sense of working and saving, subjects now central to my work at the 

Federal Reserve; I understood the importance of earning enough interest on my savings 

to pay for the things I wanted. 

And this morning, that is what I want to talk about.  I’d like to provide some 

perspective on the implications of the Federal Reserve’s current monetary policy stance 

for savers and, in particular, to explore notions that low interest rates could be hurting 

savers and hindering, rather than helping, the recovery.  In order to explore this idea, we 

first need to go back in time and review the evolution of the economy in the past several 

years from the perspective of the Federal Reserve, as well as the monetary policy 

response to the events that unfolded.  Then we can look at the particular effects that the 

Fed’s monetary policy stance can be having in terms of interest rate levels.  Of course, 

while my remarks are intended to help you understand monetary policy, I should note 


 - 3 - 

that they reflect my own views and not necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve 

System.   

Recent Economic Developments 

As you know, in late 2007 the financial crisis triggered a severe downturn in the 

U.S. economy.  The recovery from what has been referred to as the “Great Recession” 

officially began in the third quarter of 2009, but the pace of economic growth since then 

has been modest relative to the type of cyclical rebound that we had experienced in the 

prior 60 years.  In part, this modest pace of the expansion to date reflects the extent to 

which the effects of the global financial crisis on financial markets and financial 

institutions--and hence on the flow of credit to households and businesses--have been 

slow to unwind.   

The recession’s toll on households and businesses was enormous:  Between 

January 2008 and February 2010, we lost 8-3/4 million nonfarm payroll jobs and saw the 

unemployment rate double, from roughly 5 percent to around 10 percent.  Real gross 

domestic product (GDP) dropped 5 percent between its pre-recession peak in the fourth 

quarter of 2007 and the trough in the second quarter of 2009; the drop in real disposable 

personal income was similar in magnitude.  In addition, households lost an estimated 

$7 trillion in home equity--half of the aggregate home equity that existed in early 2006.   

The economic recovery is now about 2-1/2 years old, but only in mid-2011 did 

the level of real GDP return to its level just prior to the recession.  Perhaps more 

troubling is that real disposable personal income at the end of 2011 was still estimated to 

be lower than its pre-recession level.  As of January of this year, we had recovered just 

over one-third of the payroll jobs we lost, and the unemployment rate was still elevated at 


 - 4 - 

8.3 percent.  As you might expect, the slow recovery in the labor market has been 

mirrored in only a modest recovery in households’ wage and salary income.  Moreover, 

the gradual recovery in business activity has depressed households’ returns on their 

financial assets, and the value of many homes is still depressed.  This unusual weakness 

in household income and wealth, coupled with impaired access to credit, has attenuated 

the normal recovery in consumer demand that typically occurs during an economic 

upturn.  

Early last year, consumer price inflation was boosted by sharp run-ups in the 

prices of food and energy, which also worked to dampen household spending.  In 

addition, the Japanese tsunami last March disrupted supplies of various inputs to the 

production of motor vehicles and boosted vehicle prices for a time.  Indeed, inflation, as 

measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, moved up from an 

annual rate of 1-1/2 percent in 2010 to 3-1/2 percent in the first half of last year.  

However, as the effects of the price shocks waned, this overall measure of consumer 

prices retraced the run-up, moving back down to an annual rate of 1-3/4 percent in the 

second half of the year.  The moderation in consumer price inflation continued in 

January, but gasoline prices have been rising again of late, which will likely push up 

overall inflation in coming months.  Whether the increase in gasoline prices, and energy 

prices more broadly, turns into a persistent inflation problem depends critically on the 

evolution of inflation expectations.  Last year, as actual inflation accelerated and 

decelerated, survey measures and financial market indicators of inflation expectations 

remained relatively stable, which limited the influence of the price shocks we saw a year 


 - 5 - 

ago.  If, as I expect, inflation expectations remain stable in response to the recent run-up 

in gasoline prices, their influence on overall inflation should be limited as well. 

Of late, we have had some relatively encouraging economic news.  Now that most 

of the economic data for late 2011 have arrived, we can see that the pace of economic 

activity improved over the second half of the year as the drag on spending and production 

from high energy prices and temporary supply chain disruptions from the disasters in 

Japan and Thailand waned.  Real GDP rose at an annual rate of 2-1/2 percent in the 

second half of 2011, compared with an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half.  

Consumer spending increased at a moderate rate, exports expanded solidly, and business 

investment rose further.  In the labor market, employment gains picked up beginning in 

the fall, and in recent months the unemployment rate has declined noticeably.   

But at the same time, the headwinds that have been restraining the expansion for 

some time have been easing, at best, only gradually.  The housing market is still very 

depressed--weighed down by the large inventory of vacant homes for sale, the substantial 

number of properties at some stage in the foreclosure process, and homebuyers’ concerns 

that house prices will continue to fall.  In addition, spending at all levels of government 

continued to contract late last year.  Despite some improvement, credit conditions for 

many consumers and for smaller businesses remain tight.  Although households appeared 

to become a bit more optimistic about the outlook around the turn of the year, they were 

still extremely pessimistic about their income prospects.  In part, those views are likely 

the result of many having endured extended periods of very high long-term 

unemployment or having to settle for only part-time work.  In addition, the run-up in 


 - 6 - 

gasoline prices we are currently experiencing will presumably reduce household 

purchasing power in coming months.   

 Looking forward, the projections that the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) prepared in late January show real GDP increasing  2.2 to 2.7 percent this year, 

not much different from its pace in the second half of last year.  At that rate, the central 

tendency of our forecasts for the unemployment rate shows only a small improvement 

over the course of this year.  And inflation is expected to run at or below our 2 percent 

longer-run goal.  A number of factors that I mentioned earlier contribute to our judgment 

that the pace of expansion is likely to remain modest over coming quarters, including the 

depressed housing market, small real income gains, and the probability of continued 

fiscal restraint.  In addition, the information on economic activity abroad, particularly in 

Europe, seemed to be pointing to weaker demand for U.S. exports.  

Monetary Policy 

Given the magnitude of the global financial crisis and its aftermath, the Federal 

Reserve acted to provide unprecedented monetary stimulus to promote and then support 

an economic recovery.  In addition to moving the federal funds rate--our traditional 

policy tool--close to zero, we have engaged in balance sheet operations that are aimed at 

lowering longer-term yields.  Most recently, over the second half of 2011, the FOMC 

decided to increase the average maturity of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings 

through a program of purchases and sales and began to reinvest principal payments on 

agency securities in agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities rather than Treasury 

securities.  Moreover, the FOMC has worked to clarify its forward guidance about the 

future path of the federal funds rate, conditional on the outlook for economic activity and 


 - 7 - 

inflation.  These actions were intended to put downward pressure on longer-term interest 

rates, support mortgage markets, and, more broadly, help foster financial conditions that 

would provide more support to economic growth. 

At the January FOMC meeting, with our current projections for economic activity 

and inflation in mind, the Committee decided that more accommodative financial 

conditions would be appropriate to help bring both inflation and unemployment back, 

over time, to levels viewed as consistent with the FOMC’s longer-run objectives 

mandated by the Congress.  The FOMC judged that economic conditions, including the 

outlook for low rates of resource utilization and subdued inflation over the medium run, 

are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through late 

2014, more than a year later than it had indicated in the postmeeting statements starting 

last August.  Extending the horizon of the forward guidance appeared to shift down 

investors’ expectations regarding the future path of the target federal funds rate.  If this 

expectation for low rates is realized, the federal funds rate will have remained near zero 

for a total of about six years, a historically unprecedented occurrence in the United States.  

Moreover, assuming that the FOMC follows the plans that we outlined in June 2011 for 

winding down the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet, any initial sales of our securities 

holdings presumably would not begin until 2015, sometime after the first increase in the 

target federal funds rate.  

The Effects of Monetary Policy on Savers 

This extended period of depressed levels of economic activity and low interest 

rates will continue to have important implications for household income flows.  In 

particular, critics of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy are correct 

that the low level of interest rates represents a strain on households who rely on income 


 - 8 - 

from interest-bearing assets; indeed, the flow of interest income that households earn on 

their savings has declined about one-fourth since the recession began.  However, I would 

also emphasize that many households are benefiting from the low level of interest rates, 

and some critics of the Federal Reserve’s accommodative monetary policy seem to 

minimize this point.  Purchases of motor vehicles and other household durables can be 

financed more cheaply, and in many cases, households have been able to refinance their 

mortgages into lower-rate loans, freeing up income for other uses. 

In addition, interest-bearing assets represent only a modest portion of overall 

household assets.  According to the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances, less 

than 7 percent of total household assets are directly held in transaction accounts, 

certificates of deposit, savings bonds, and bonds.

  Instead, the bulk of household wealth 

is held in stocks, retirement accounts, business equity, and real estate.  For these other 

types of assets, rates of return depend primarily on the strength of the economy and how 

fast the economy is growing.  Thus, these returns should be supported, over time, by the 

accommodative monetary policy that we have in place.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve 

aims to keep inflation low and stable over time, which limits the risk to investors that 

high inflation will undermine the value of their savings.   

 I also want to specifically address the argument raised by critics that an extended 

period of low interest rates will discourage households from saving and, as a result, 

diminish the longer-run economic growth prospects of the U.S. economy.  Currently, 

households have a number of reasons to save in addition to their desire to earn interest.

For instance, they need to be prepared for unexpected expenses and to rebuild the 

retirement nest eggs that were depleted by losses in equity and housing wealth during the 

recession.  In fact, the portion of disposable income that households are saving has risen 

considerably since the recession began.  Moreover, it is important to remember that the 

way that households’ savings get channeled into productive capacity is that businesses 

have to be willing to use those funds to invest in expanding their plants and starting new 

businesses.  Raising interest rates now would dampen those incentives.  Thus, at the 

moment, channeling households’ savings into the productive resources that will support 

our longer-term economic growth prospects requires low interest rates, not higher ones.       

Conclusion 

In summary, the length of time required for the economy to fully recover given 

the extraordinary strains of the past few years is difficult to predict.  I believe that the 

policy record in recent years clearly demonstrates the Federal Reserve’s commitment to 

act as appropriate to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The highly 

accommodative monetary policy now in place is intended to provide the support needed 

to strengthen the economic expansion and, over time, return the economy to sustainable 

rates of output growth, unemployment, and inflation.  While the Federal Reserve 

recognizes that the accommodative policy we have put in place to support the economic 

recovery may limit the financial returns to saving for a time, ultimately our goal is an 

economy that is operating close to its potential and is producing jobs, income, and 

opportunities for investment that will lead to higher returns across a range of assets for 

savers and investors.   

Thank you.
