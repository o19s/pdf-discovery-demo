I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in the Federal Reserve Bank of San 

Francisco’s Asia Economic Policy Conference, and I thank the organizers for inviting 

me.1  After a long period of rapid economic growth, Asia’s emerging economies appear 

to have entered a transitional phase.  For decades, emerging Asian economies have been 

among the fastest growing and most dynamic in the world.  Supported by an export-

oriented development model, annual growth averaged 7-1/2 percent in the three decades 

leading up to the global financial crisis.  As shown in table 1, the fast pace of growth in 

emerging Asia has also supported impressive gains in per capita income within the 

region.     

As the economies of emerging Asia have developed, they have followed a similar 

growth trajectory, also apparent in table 1.  Along a path pioneered by Japan in the 1960s, 

initial integration into the global economy has been followed by a period of rapid export-

led economic growth, which subsequently slows as the economy develops and incomes 

rise.  In a process that has been likened to the pattern of flying geese, development in 

Japan pushed more labor-intensive production from Japan into the “Asian tigers”--that is, 

Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan--with that set of countries experiencing rapid 

growth in the 1970s and 1980s.  As the tigers developed, low-value-added production 

was pushed further on, into the group of countries known as the Association of Southeast 

Asian Nations (ASEAN)--primarily Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and, more recently, 

China, where growth took off in the 1980s and accelerated through the 2000s.2  At each 

                                                 
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on the Federal 
Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.  I am grateful to Joseph Gruber and Jasper 
Hoek for their contributions to this speech.  I also thank Ravi Menon of the Monetary Authority of 
Singapore and Changyong Rhee, Ratna Sahay, and James Walsh of the International Monetary Fund for 
their assistance.

step in this process, the slowing of growth in the relatively developed and globally 

integrated Asian economies was matched by an acceleration of growth in the less 

developed and less integrated economies, maintaining the overall rapid pace of growth in 

the region.3     

Now, with China perhaps beginning to follow the same trajectory of slowing 

growth as has been experienced by its predecessors in the East Asian growth model and 

without economies of sufficient scale to fill the gap (with the notable exception of India, 

which I will discuss later), growth for the region as a whole is declining.  As shown in 

table 2, taken from the most recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) regional outlook 

for Asia, growth in emerging Asia is set to decline in 2015 and 2016, with China’s 

growth decelerating.4  Furthermore, the IMF projections through 2020 call for almost no 

pickup from this slower pace. 

In my discussion, I will first address some of the factors behind slowing growth in 

emerging Asia, importantly including demographics.  I will then cover one of the global 

implications of this deceleration, the effect on commodity markets, before looking at the 

                                                 
   As production of labor-intensive goods has moved from one group of countries to the next, concerns have 
been raised about a decrease in “competitiveness” in the relatively more developed Asian economies.  
These concerns have been particularly pronounced in regard to China, where commentators have 
questioned whether China’s rise has come at the expense of growth in its neighbors or provided an extra 
impetus to growth.  Research studies (see Zheng, Wern, and You (2005) and Haltmaier and others (2007)) 
have generally found that China’s rise has been positive for regional growth, with China’s development as 
an export platform boosting the overall competitiveness of the region’s exports.    
3 In addition to integration with the global economy, a number of other factors have also contributed to the 
East Asian growth miracle.  With regard to China, Brandt and Rawski (2008) highlight the importance of 
incremental reform focused on removing the most binding constraints on economic activity.  Of course, 
reform is not independent of global integration, as the heightened international competition associated with 
opening an economy likely incentivizes increased reform.   
4  The IMF does not include Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, or Taiwan in its definition of emerging Asia.  
For the purposes of my discussion, I group these four economies along with China, India, Indonesia, 
Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam as emerging Asia.  


 - 3 - 

prospects for India to recharge the region’s growth dynamic.  I will end with some 

thoughts on Asia’s place in the global economy both now and in the years to come. 

Why Is Growth in Emerging Asia Slowing? 

The first thing to say and think about Asian growth is that growth at a rate of 

above 6 percent is not slow; it is slower than it has been, but it remains impressive.  There 

are four factors weighing on emerging Asian growth that I would like to highlight.  First, 

emerging Asia continues to be negatively affected by slow demand growth elsewhere, 

including in the advanced economies.  Second, economies generally decelerate as they 

develop, a pattern that has already been evidenced in many of emerging Asia’s growth 

pioneers.  Third, the tremendous growth of trade in the region, driven by the process of 

global integration and the growth of production-sharing networks, may have plateaued.  

Lastly, demographic trends in a number of emerging Asian countries are likely to affect 

growth in the coming years.5     

Regarding the first of the factors that I just listed, contrary to often-repeated and 

often-resurrected stories of emerging market growth “decoupling” from that of the 

advanced economies, the truth is that advanced-economy demand continues to play a key 

role in emerging Asia’s economic conditions.6  And, as we all know, advanced-economy 

demand for imports in recent years has been lackluster.  Real goods imports in the United 

States, Japan, and the euro area have all increased at an average annual pace of about 

                                                 
5 In a speech of this length and scope, it is not possible to relate all important developments affecting Asian 
growth.  In particular, I will not address the need for further development of financial systems and 
infrastructure in Asian emerging economies, which will be important factors in determining future rates of 
growth.    
6 This point is particularly well made in Monetary Authority of Singapore (2007).   


 - 4 - 

3-1/2 percent over the past three years, in all cases about half the average pace recorded 

in the two decades leading up to the financial crisis.       

Regarding the second factor, as is well established by theory and supported by 

empirical experience, economic growth tends to decelerate as a country develops.  In a 

capital-poor developing economy, initial increases in investment generally have high 

returns, which then decline as capital accumulates.  Likewise, the initial phase of 

integration with the global economy is typically marked by strong gains in productivity 

as methods and technologies are adopted from more advanced economies.  Over time, the 

boost to growth from this catch-up in productivity fades.  Also, as incomes rise and 

consumption grows, there is a tendency for a relatively rapid increase in demand for 

services.  The shift of domestic resources toward the production of services, which are 

typically associated with lower productivity growth, tends to further lower trend growth. 

The factors that have tended to temper growth as economies develop appear to be 

at play in China.  Following years of exceptionally high investment, the return on capital 

appears to be moderating, and the ratio of investment to gross domestic product (GDP), 

after peaking near 50 percent of GDP in 2011, has begun to edge down.  As viewed in the 

context of the Lewis model, China could be reaching the stage at which the supply of 

labor from the subsistence agricultural sector becomes a constraint on growth.  Further, 

productivity growth, though robust by global standards, has been declining.   

This decrease is likely due, at least in part, to the rapid growth of services 

consumption.  One of the most noteworthy aspects of China’s recent GDP data has been 

the strength of services, with services now accounting for half of the value added in GDP, 

up from just over 40 percent in 2008.   


 - 5 - 

Next, I would like to discuss the third factor weighing on Asian growth--trade.  

Global integration and trade growth have played a key role in the Asian economic 

success story, and the recent slowdown in global trade, over and above what might be 

expected given the weakness of advanced-economy demand discussed earlier, is likely to 

affect emerging Asian growth prospects.     

During the financial crisis, global trade collapsed.  After the immediate crisis 

faded, trade bounced back in many cases.  But the bounceback was more limited than the 

decline, with the increase in the volume of trade since 2012 only matching the pace of 

global output growth, a considerable deceleration from the previous two decades, when 

trade increased at twice the pace of global output.  While the legacy of the crisis, 

particularly the continued weakness of traded-good-intensive investment in many 

economies, has likely contributed to the weakness of global trade, a slowdown in intra-

Asian regional trade also appears to be a factor.  After increasing at an average rate of 

about 15 percent a year through the 2000s, nominal intra-Asian trade flows have flattened 

out considerably over the past couple of years, in part reflecting a slowdown in the 

growth of production sharing within the region.   

The outlook for a renewed surge in intra-Asian trade does not appear to be 

promising.  The growth of production-sharing networks in Asia has been tied to the 

region’s export-oriented growth model.  In particular, China’s integration into the global 

economy as the hub of this production network provided a significant boost to the 

development and growth of these networks.  As China and the region shift toward 

domestic demand and away from external demand, it seems unlikely that trade growth in 

the region will return to its earlier exceptional pace. 


 - 6 - 

To the extent that the expansion of these networks was tied to export-led growth 

that depended partly on preferential treatment of the export sector, more-balanced growth 

in these economies may also result in a better allocation of production across countries.  

If growth of trade is lower as a result, that is not necessarily a problem.  However, there 

is a well-established literature indicating that trade encourages greater efficiency, along 

with the dissemination of technological innovation, and slower growth of trade could 

reduce this effect. 

It also bears noting that Asian trade growth has been accompanied by the creation 

of a variety of intraregional and broader trade agreements--including the 10-nation 

ASEAN and membership in the World Trade Organization, which China achieved in 

2001 and Vietnam in 2007--as well as a host of bilateral agreements, both within and 

outside the region.  I will return briefly to the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) at the end 

of the talk. 

Finally, demographics are an additional factor likely to lower growth in the 

region, particularly in Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, Thailand, and China, 

notwithstanding the recent relaxation of the one-child policy.  As shown in table 3, both 

China and Thailand have a median population age of about 37 years, about the same as 

the median in the United States.  The median age is even higher in Hong Kong, Korea, 

and Singapore, all of which have medians of 40 years or more.  Relatedly, as shown in 

the second column of the table, China, Thailand, and the relatively developed emerging 

Asian economies are expected to have a significant percentage of their populations older 

than 65 years by 2030, with the proportion similar to that in the United States, though still 

below those in Germany and Japan.  In contrast, demographics are less of an issue 


 - 7 - 

elsewhere in the region, particularly in India and most of ASEAN, including Indonesia, 

Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, which have medians of 30 years or less.  Just as 

slowing workforce growth is likely to be a drag on growth in many developed countries, 

trend growth is likely to be held back by demographic developments in relatively elderly 

emerging Asian economies as well.  

Up to this point, I have discussed a number of factors that are likely to lower 

emerging Asia’s growth trajectory in the coming years.  However, the overall message is 

not a pessimistic one; rather, for the most part, the slowing of growth is a natural 

transition and an outcome of Asia’s remarkable economic success.   

As many have noted over the years, maintaining growth sufficiently rapid to meet 

the development aspirations of the region will require a transition toward an economic 

paradigm more rooted in domestic demand, particularly consumption.  The need for this 

transition, or rebalancing, is most apparent and also widely acknowledged in China, the 

current hub of emerging Asia’s export-led model.  The need for these economies--

primarily China, but also those economies that export through China--to switch toward 

domestic demand largely reflects their having become too big and too important to rely to 

the extent they have on the export-led models of the past.   

On growth, the bottom line that should be emphasized is that even with a 

diminished pace of growth, the region is still expected to significantly outpace the global 

economy and make by far the largest contribution to global growth in the years ahead. 

Spillovers from Asia’s Economic Transition:  Commodity Markets 

I will now focus on an area where the spillovers of Asia’ economic transition are 

likely to be substantial--global commodity markets.   


 - 8 - 

Emerging Asia has played an outsized role in commodity markets for some time 

now.  Specifically, China, with its investment-heavy growth model, has accounted for a 

substantial amount of incremental commodity demand over the past two decades.  Since 

2000, China has accounted for roughly 40 percent of the increase in global demand for oil 

and 80 percent of the growth in demand for steel.  For copper, all of the incremental rise 

in global demand has come from China, with demand excluding China falling over the 

period.       

The strength of emerging Asian demand growth pushed commodity prices up 

sharply over most of the past decade, at least temporarily reversing what seemed to be an 

inexorable decline in both commodity prices and the terms of trade of commodity 

producers in the preceding two decades.  Higher prices were a tremendous boon to 

commodity producers and supported a decade of strong growth in a number of emerging 

market economies, as well as commodity sectors in certain advanced economies, 

including Australia and the United States.   

Since mid-2014, commodity prices have plummeted, with oil prices falling almost 

60 percent and a broad index of metals prices losing about one-third of its value, dragging 

down growth in many commodity producers.  Although rapid commodity output growth 

in recent years, which has reflected in part the response of producers to previous price 

increases, has certainly contributed to the fall in commodity prices, the slowing of 

demand growth from China and emerging Asia has also been an important factor.   

While the path ahead for commodity prices is, as always, uncertain, declining 

investment rates in emerging Asia, particularly China, present the prospect of a prolonged 

decline in the growth rate of commodity demand.  And prices could remain low for quite 


 - 9 - 

some time, which seems particularly true for metals, such as copper and steel, used 

heavily in construction and investment.  However, for oil, the implications of a shift from 

investment-led growth to a consumption-led model are less certain.  On a per capita basis, 

China’s consumption of oil remains far below that of advanced economies, in line with 

China’s lower rate of car ownership.  Per capita oil consumption tends to increase with 

wealth, such that further income growth in China has the potential to provide strong 

support for the oil market in the coming years.  

Indeed, more generally, the world stands to benefit from a transition to more 

consumption-led growth in emerging Asia.  Under a successful transition toward more-

balanced growth, emerging Asia can be expected to import a broader array of goods and 

services both from within the region and globally.  Whether a country benefits from or is 

harmed by emerging Asia’s transition is likely to be determined by the flexibility of that 

country’s economy in adapting to shifts in Asian demand away from commodities and 

inputs for assembly into the region’s exports and toward services and goods to meet 

Asian final demand.   

To recap, the transition to slower growth in the emerging Asian economies, as 

well as a shift toward domestic demand and consumption and away from external 

demand and investment in the region, is likely to have profound implications for the 

global economy.  For one, trade growth is unlikely to resume its rapid pace of recent 

decades, and the long climb in commodity prices, which has benefited commodity 

producers, appears to have come to an end.   


 - 10 - 

Can India Recharge Growth in Emerging Asia? 

One source of uncertainty in this outlook, as alluded to earlier, is the prospect for 

India to provide a new growth engine for Asian development.  In principle, India has 

enormous potential to recharge the Asian growth engine.  For one, India is relatively 

unintegrated into global production-sharing networks.  For example, machinery and 

electrical products, which feature heavily in production-sharing and which make up about 

half of exports in other emerging Asian economies, account for only 15 percent of India’s 

exports.  Foreign direct investment into India is about half the size of similar flows into 

China as a percentage of GDP, and GDP per capita, at $1,600 in 2014, remains 

considerably below emerging Asia’s average.   

All told, while the export-led growth model that propelled growth in China and 

other economies in emerging Asia has matured, pushing down growth rates, India 

remains at a relatively early stage of its development trajectory.  Further capital 

deepening and the potential for further productivity gains suggest that India could 

maintain rapid economic growth for a number of years.  As mentioned previously, India 

is also a young country, with a relatively low dependency ratio and a growing workforce.  

By United Nations estimates, India is set to overtake China during the next decade as the 

world’s most populous nation.    

In the 1960s and 1970s, the Indian economy grew at around 3 to 4 percent.  In 

subsequent decades the growth rate averaged close to 6 percent, and in the early years of 

this century it rose further, as can be seen in Table 1.  In 2015, growth in India is 

expected to be 7-1/4 percent, the fastest among large economies, and the IMF expects 

growth to pick up from this already rapid pace through the end of the decade.  Growth 


 - 11 - 

has been supported by an improved macroeconomic policy framework, including a 

strengthening of the framework for conducting monetary policy, as well as legal and 

regulatory reform.  And the authorities have embarked on an ambitious program to 

improve the business environment.  

That said, significant roadblocks need to be overcome for India to reach its full 

potential.  The economy continues to suffer from a number of infrastructure bottlenecks 

that will be alleviated only through a pronounced increase in investment rates, a process 

that would likely be helped by a relaxation of restrictions on foreign direct investment.  

Likewise, efforts at difficult reform will have to be sustained.  There is much hard work 

ahead if India is to come closer to fulfilling the potential that it so manifestly has.    

Concluding Remarks 

The performance of the Asian economies--notably those of East Asia, particularly 

China, Japan, and Korea--especially in the past six or seven decades, is an outstanding, if 

not unique, episode in the history of the global economy.   

What lies ahead?  In the relatively near future probably some major central banks 

will begin gradually moving away from near-zero interest rates.  The question here is 

whether the emerging market countries of Asia—and, indeed, of the world--are 

sufficiently prepared for these decisions, to the extent that potential capital flows and 

market adjustments can take place without major macroeconomic consequences.  While 

we continue to scrutinize incoming data, and no final decisions have been made, we have 

done everything we can to avoid surprising the markets and governments when we move, 

to the extent that several emerging market (and other) central bankers have, for some 

time, been telling the Fed to “just do it.”  


 - 12 - 

Further ahead lies the answer to the question of whether developments in the 

global economy will permit the continuation of the export-centered growth strategy that 

underlies the Asian miracle or whether we will later conclude that this period, the period 

after the Great Recession and the global financial crisis, marked the beginning of a new 

phase in the economic history of the modern global economy.7  Either way, the question 

of the economic future of India is of major importance not only to the 18 percent of the 

world’s population that lives in India, but also to the other 82 percent of the global 

population.   

At a more structural level are three recent developments whose potential 

importance is currently difficult to assess: the setting up of the Asian Infrastructure 

Investment Bank; the likely inclusion of the Chinese yuan in the Special Drawing Rights 

basket; and the possible establishment of the TPP, a partnership in which China is not 

expected to be a founding member.8    

These are interesting and potentially important developments.  Underlying the 

answer to the questions of what they portend, is the answer to the basic question of 

whether the economic center of gravity of the world will continue its shift of recent 

decades toward Asia--in particular, to China or, perhaps, to China and India.  This shift 

would represent a return in some key respects to the global order of two centuries ago and 

earlier, before the economic rise of the West.   

                                                 
7 See World Bank (1993) for an early attempt to define the sources of East Asian growth. 
8 At this point, the reader will recall the supposed remark by Chou En-lai that it is too early to assess the 
importance of the French revolution.  The most plausible current version of that story is that Chou was 
answering a question about the importance of the 1968 student riots in Paris. 
   The countries expected to become members of the TPP are, in alphabetical order, Australia, Brunei, 
Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, the United States, and Vietnam. 


 - 13 - 

A partial answer to that question is that China is for some time likely to continue 

to grow faster than the rest of the world and thus to produce an increasing share of global 

output.  Its importance in the global economy is likely to increase, and it is probable that, 

one way or another, its growth will result in its playing a more decisive role in the 

international economy and in international economic institutions.   

Finally, we need to remind ourselves that geopolitical factors will play a critical 

role in the unfolding of that process.
