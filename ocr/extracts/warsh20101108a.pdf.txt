Thank you to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association for inviting me 

to your annual meeting.1 

The New Malaise 

After a cyclical boost early this year, the current state of the U.S. economy is 

unimpressive:  modest growth in output, high levels of unemployment, stagnant wages, low 

levels of consumer and business sentiment, and volatile financial markets.  Extrapolating from 

recent data, many in your business and mine predict only a middling recovery in the next several 

years.  They call it “the new normal.”  I call it the new malaise. 

The prevailing theory has it that U.S. policymakers should not deny our foregone fate.  

We should accept smaller improvements in output and employment and productivity over the 

horizon.  We should not stand before you and feign optimism or profess misplaced hubris.   

Instead, we should resign ourselves to the new normal now upon us, and conduct policy 

accordingly.  In particular, central bankers in advanced economies--against a backdrop of 

disinflation--should be comfortably permissive in the conduct of monetary policy, still more 

encouraging of still more accommodative central bank policies for still longer periods.  That is 

the last best hope, they argue, to preserve the remaining vestiges of a golden age that is no more. 

I reject this view.  I consider this emerging ethos to be dangerous and defeatist and 

debunked by America’s own exceptional economic history.  The dour economic tale being told is 

not inevitable.  Our citizens are not unwitting victims of some unavoidable fate.  The current 

period of subpar growth and high unemployment is real, but it need not persist.  We should not 

lower our expectations.  We should improve our policies.

Federal Open Market Committee.

Broad macroeconomic policies have not changed direction in the past several years.  But 

change they must, if we are to prosper.  In my remarks, I will first venture outside the realm of 

monetary policy.  I do this not in the hope of expanding further the remit of the Federal Reserve.  

To the contrary--I do this because of the heavy burdens being heaped upon monetary policy.  To 

give monetary policy a chance to be more effective, other key macroeconomic policies--fiscal, 

regulatory, and trade policy--cannot be working at cross-purposes.  So, let me discuss how these 

policies--some long-in-the-making--might be reformed to restore the purpose and promise of our 

prosperity.  Then, I will return to the conduct of monetary policy. 

Sharing the Burden 

We can no longer afford to tolerate economic policies that are preoccupied with the here-

and-now.  Chronic short-termism in the conduct of economic policy has done much to bring us 

to this parlous point.  Think of your businesses in the public markets--and the harm that can be 

done to long-term prospects--if you were to do nothing but yield to the whims of analysts and the 

tyranny of quarterly measures.  The best of your firms most surely deliver on your promises to 

your stakeholders, but your strategic judgments are made with a focus on the long term.  You 

should accept no less from your country’s policymakers. 

By now, policymakers should be skeptical of the long-term benefits of temporary fixes-- 

one-off Band-Aids and short-cuts--to do the hard work of resurrecting the world’s great 

economic power.  Consider the fiscal impulse.  No doubt aggregate demand fell dramatically 

during the recession, and its weakness continues to mark the economic landscape.  Since early 

2008, the fiscal authorities sought to fill the hole left by the falloff in demand through large, 

temporary stimulus--checks-in-the-mail to spur consumption, temporary housing rebates to raise

demand, one-time cash-for-clunkers to move inventory, and temporary business tax credits to 

spur investment. 

These programs may well have boosted gross domestic product (GDP) for a quarter or 

two, but that is scarcely a full accounting of their effects.  These stimulus programs did little, in 

my view, to put the economy on a stronger, more sustainable trajectory.  Sound fiscal policy 

must do more than reacquaint consumers with old, bad habits.  And sensible fiscal policymakers 

should set their sights higher than merely coaxing businesses to do today what they would 

otherwise do tomorrow. 

Policymakers should also take notice of the critical importance of the supply side of the 

economy.  The supply side establishes its productive capacity.  It is a function of the quality and 

quantity of labor and capital assembled by our companies.  Recovery after a recession demands 

that capital and labor be reallocated.  But, the reallocation of these resources to new sectors and 

companies has been painfully slow and unnecessarily interrupted.  We are now feeling the ill 

effects. 

If policymakers fail to give the supply side of the economy more considered attention, we 

will find the new normalists to be right.  If untreated, the cyclical becomes structural.  Persistent 

weakness in the labor markets, in effect, permanently disqualifies more workers from a place in 

the labor force.  The natural rate of unemployment moves higher and potential GDP falls.  And 

substantial harm is done to our well-being, threatening to demoralize our populace who knows 

better.  But, this need not be so. 

Fiscal authorities should resist the temptation to increase government expenditures 

continually to compensate for shortfalls of private consumption and investment.  A strict 


- 4 - 
 


economic diet of fiscal austerity has greater appeal, a kind of penance owed for the excesses of 

the past.  But root-canal economics does not constitute, in my view, optimal economic policy.   

The United States would be better off with a third way:  pro-growth economic policy.  

After all, it is stronger growth that the U.S. and world economies most urgently need. 

The fiscal authorities should begin this exercise by asking two questions:  How big a 

government is desired?  And how is it to be funded?  We can no longer afford the answers to 

each of these questions to be at odds.  But, the conduct of fiscal policy should not stop there.  

The government can fund its endeavors in ways that are growth-friendly or growth-stifling.  We 

can no longer afford to be indifferent to the choice. 

The adoption of pro-growth economic policies would strengthen incentives to invest in 

capital and labor over the horizon.  It would place the country’s economic potential at the center 

of the policy nexus.  Pro-growth policies would give us the best opportunity to bring 

unemployment rates down dramatically.  Of course, it demands a highly mobile, educated 

workforce, and much work needs to be done there.  But the good news is that the United States 

still has the most dynamic, resilient labor force in the world, and the deepest, most liquid capital 

markets.  It is strong growth that can do more to increase government revenues.  It is strong 

growth that can most effectively defease outsized liabilities.  And it is strong growth that can 

pave the way for robust job creation and higher living standards. 

Pro-growth policies include reform of the tax code to make it simpler and more 

transparent, and more conducive to long-term investment.  The improved regime would reduce 

policy uncertainty over the life of an investment in labor or capital.  And it would provide for far 

more efficient capital allocation.

Pro-growth policies also demand reform in the conduct of regulatory policy.  It would 

provide more timely, clear, and consistent rules so that firms--financial and otherwise--could 

innovate in a changing economic landscape.  It would allow firms to succeed or fail.  It would 

not protect the privileged perch of incumbent firms--no matter their size or scope--at the expense 

of their smaller, more dynamic competitors.  Regulators would be hostile to rent-seeking by the 

established.  And hospitable to the companies whose names we do not know. 

Finally, the creep of trade protectionism is anathema to pro-growth policies.  U.S. 

companies need access to foreign lands to grow exports.  No less important, U.S. companies are 

made better by global competition.  Adopting pro-growth trade policies would signal to the 

world that the United States is ready to resume its leading role on the world stage. 

So, how far does the economy find itself from our aspirations?  If policies could be 

moved in the right direction, we could close the gap between the new malaise and the new 

promise.  Policy need not be perfect, but it cannot be so growth-defeating.  The U.S. economy is 

capable of much more than it is delivering. 

Hence, the deleveraging by our household and business sectors is not a pattern to be 

arrested, but good prudence to be celebrated.  Larger, more liquid corporate balance sheets and 

higher personal saving rates are the reasonable and right responses to massive government 

dissaving and unpredictable government policies.  The steep correction in housing markets, 

while painful, lays the foundation for recovery--far better than the countless programs that 

sought to subsidize and temporize the inevitable repricing.  It is these transitions in our market 

economy--and the adoption of pro-growth fiscal, regulatory, and trade policies--that lay the 

essential groundwork for greater, more sustainable prosperity.

The Conduct of Monetary Policy 

The Federal Reserve is not a repair shop for broken fiscal, trade, or regulatory policies.  

Given what ails us, additional monetary policy measures are, at best, poor substitutes for more 

powerful pro-growth policies.  The Fed can lose its hard-earned credibility--and monetary policy 

can lose its considerable sway--if its policies overpromise or underdeliver.  We should be leery 

of drawing inapt lessons from the crisis to the current policy conjuncture.  Lender-of-last-resort 

authority cannot readily be converted into fighter-of-first resort power. 

Monetary policy can surely have great influence--most notably by establishing stable 

prices and appropriate financial conditions--on the real economy.  By my way of thinking, the 

risk-reward ratio for Fed action peaks in times of crisis when it has a full toolbox and markets are 

functioning poorly.  But when non-traditional tools are needed to loosen policy and markets are 

functioning more or less normally--even with output and employment below trend--the risk-

reward ratio for policy action is decidedly less favorable.  In my view, these risks increase with 

the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  As a result, we cannot and should not be as 

aggressive as conventional policy rules--cultivated in more benign environments--might judge 

appropriate. 

Last week, my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

engaged in this debate.  The FOMC announced its intent to expand the Fed’s balance sheet by 

purchasing an additional $75 billion of long-term Treasury securities per month through the 

second quarter of 2011.  The FOMC did not make an unconditional or open-ended commitment.   

And I consider the FOMC’s action as necessarily limited, circumscribed, and subject to regular 

review.  Policies should be altered if certain objectives are satisfied, purported benefits 

disappoint, or potential risks threaten to materialize.

The goals of the Federal Reserve’s policies are to promote economic recovery and to help 

ensure price stability, consistent with our mandate.  I am less optimistic than some that additional 

asset purchases will have significant, durable benefits for the real economy.  Of course, benefits 

may well be more substantial than I anticipate.  Lower risk-free rates and higher equity prices--if 

sustained--could strengthen household and business balance sheets, and raise confidence in the 

strength of the economy.  Modestly higher rates of inflation could increase nominal growth, and 

ostensibly place the economy on a stronger trajectory. 

But, expanding the Fed’s balance sheet is not a free option.  There are significant risks 

that bear careful monitoring by the FOMC.  If the recent weakness in the dollar, run-up in 

commodity prices, and other forward-looking indicators are sustained and passed along into final 

prices, the Fed’s price stability objective might no longer be a compelling policy rationale.  In 

such a case--even with the unemployment rate still high--the FOMC would have cause to 

consider the path of policy.  This is truer still if inflation expectations increase materially.  And if 

the Fed’s holdings work predominantly through the so-called portfolio balance channel, the 

cessation of purchases should not reverse any benefits attained. 

The Fed’s increased presence in the market for long-term Treasury securities also poses 

nontrivial risks.  The Treasury market is special.  It plays a unique role in the global financial 

system.  It is a corollary to the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve currency.  The prices assigned 

to Treasury securities--the risk-free rate--are the foundation from which the price of virtually 

every asset in the world is calculated.  As the Fed’s balance sheet expands, it becomes more of a 

price maker than a price taker in the Treasury market.  And if market participants come to doubt 

these prices--or their reliance on these prices proves fleeting--risk premiums across asset classes 

and geographies could move unexpectedly.  The shock that hit the financial markets in 2008 


- 8 - 
 


upon the imminent failures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac gives some indication of the harm 

that can be done when assets perceived to be relatively riskless turn out not to be. 

In the United States, the Fed’s expanded participation in the long-term Treasury market 

also runs the more subtle risk of obfuscating price signals about total U.S. indebtedness.  Long-

term economic growth necessitates putting the U.S. fiscal trajectory on a sounder footing.  The 

fiscal authorities need as clear an early warning system as possible, not a handy excuse to delay. 

And overseas--as a consequence of more-expansive U.S. monetary policy and distortions 

in the international monetary system--we see an increasing tendency by policymakers to 

intervene in currency markets, administer unilateral measures, institute ad hoc capital controls, 

and resort to protectionist policies.  Extraordinary measures tend to beget extraordinary 

countermeasures.  Second-order effects can have first-order consequences.  Heightened tensions 

in currency and capital markets could result in a more protracted and difficult global recovery.  

These, too, are developments that the FOMC must monitor carefully. 

Responsible monetary policy in the current environment requires attention not only to 

near-term macroeconomic conditions, but also to corollary risks with long-term effects.  Should 

these risks threaten to materialize, however one gauges the probabilities, I am confident that 

members of the FOMC will have the tools and convictions to adjust policies appropriately. 

Conclusion  

Monetary policy has done much to ease credit conditions and improve financial market 

functioning.  And it is playing an important role in setting the conditions for the real economy to 

prosper.  But, the Federal Reserve cannot and should not do it alone.  Other policymakers must 

bear their burden and do their part to encourage more-robust economic growth and establish the 

conditions for stronger employment.
