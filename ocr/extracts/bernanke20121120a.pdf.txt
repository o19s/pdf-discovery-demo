November 20, 2012 






Good afternoon.  I am pleased to join the New York Economic Club for lunch 

today.  I know that many of you and your friends and neighbors are still recovering from 

the effects of Hurricane Sandy, and I want to let you know that our thoughts are with 

everyone who has suffered during the storm and its aftermath.   

My remarks today will focus on the reasons for the disappointingly slow pace of 

economic recovery in the United States and the policy actions that have been taken by the 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to support the economy.  In addition, I will 

discuss some important economic challenges our country faces as we close out 2012 and 

move into 2013--in particular, the challenge of putting federal government finances on a 

sustainable path in the longer run while avoiding actions that would endanger the 

economic recovery in the near term. 

The Recovery from the Financial Crisis and Recession 

The economy has continued to recover from the financial crisis and recession, but 

the pace of recovery has been slower than FOMC participants and many others had hoped 

or anticipated when I spoke here about three years ago.  Indeed, since the recession 

trough in mid-2009, growth in real gross domestic product (GDP) has averaged only a 

little more than 2 percent per year.   

Similarly, the job market has improved over the past three years, but at a slow 

pace.  The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in the fall of 2009, has since 

come down 2 percentage points to just below 8 percent.  This decline is obviously 

welcome, but it has taken a long time to achieve that progress, and the unemployment 

rate is still well above both its level prior to the onset of the recession and the level that 

my colleagues and I think can be sustained once a full recovery has been achieved.

Moreover, many other features of the jobs market, including the historically high level of 

long-term unemployment, the large number of people working part time because they 

have not been able to find full-time jobs, and the decline in labor force participation, 

reinforce the conclusion that we have some way to go before the labor market can be 

deemed healthy again. 

Meanwhile, inflation has generally remained subdued.  As is often the case, 

inflation has been pushed up and down in recent years by fluctuations in the price of 

crude oil and other globally traded commodities, including the increase in farm prices 

brought on by this summer’s drought.  But with longer-term inflation expectations 

remaining stable, the ebbs and flows in commodity prices have had only transitory effects 

on inflation.  Indeed, since the recovery began about three years ago, consumer price 

inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, has 

averaged almost exactly 2 percent, which is the FOMC’s longer-run objective for 

inflation.1  Because ongoing slack in labor and product markets should continue to 

restrain wage and price increases, and with the public’s inflation expectations continuing 

to be well anchored,  inflation over the next few years is likely to remain close to or a 

little below the Committee’s objective. 

As background for our monetary policy decisionmaking, we at the Federal 

Reserve have spent a good deal of effort attempting to understand the reasons why the 

economic recovery has not been stronger.  Studies of previous financial crises provide 

one helpful place to start.2  This literature has found that severe financial crises--

                                                 
1 Inflation excluding food and energy has averaged a little less, about 1-1/2 percent, over this period.

particularly those associated with housing booms and busts--have often been associated 

with many years of subsequent weak performance.  While this result allows for many 

interpretations, one possibility is that financial crises, or the deep recessions that typically 

accompany them, may reduce an economy’s potential growth rate, at least for a time. 

The accumulating evidence does appear consistent with the financial crisis and 

the associated recession having reduced the potential growth rate of our economy 

somewhat during the past few years.  In particular, slower growth of potential output 

would help explain why the unemployment rate has declined in the face of the relatively 

modest output gains we have seen during the recovery.  Output normally has to increase 

at about its longer-term trend just to create enough jobs to absorb new entrants to the 

labor market, and faster-than-trend growth is usually needed to reduce unemployment.  

So the fact that unemployment has declined in recent years despite economic growth at 

about 2 percent suggests that the growth rate of potential output must have recently been 

lower than the roughly 2-1/2 percent rate that appeared to be in place before the crisis.3

3 That said, GDP growth in excess of potential is probably not the whole explanation for the decline in 
unemployment.  Some of the decline in unemployment during the recovery could also reflect a reversal of 
the especially large increases that occurred during the deepest part of the recession, when firms appeared to 
cut their workforces by greater numbers than would normally be associated with the decline in GDP.  (For 
a discussion, see Ben S. Bernanke (2012), “Recent Developments in the Labor Market,” speech delivered at 
the National Association for Business Economics 28th Annual Economic Policy Conference, Arlington, 
Va., March 26,   www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120326a.htm.)  A reduction in the 
number of people receiving extended or emergency unemployment insurance benefits may have 
contributed to the decline in unemployment as well.

There are a number of ways in which the financial crisis could have slowed the 

rate of growth of the economy’s potential.  For example, the extraordinarily severe job 

losses that followed the crisis, especially in housing-related industries, may have 

exacerbated for a time the extent of mismatch between the jobs available and the skills 

and locations of the unemployed.  Meanwhile, the very high level of long-term 

unemployment has probably led to some loss of skills and labor force attachment among 

those workers.  These factors may have pushed up to some degree the so-called natural 

rate of unemployment--the rate of unemployment that can be sustained under normal 

conditions--and reduced labor force participation as well.  The pace of productivity 

gains--another key determinant of growth in potential output--may also have been 

restrained by the crisis, as business investment declined sharply during the recession; and 

increases in risk aversion and uncertainty, together with tight credit conditions, may have 

impeded the commercial application of new technologies and slowed the pace of business 

formation. 

Importantly, however, although the nation’s potential output may have grown 

more slowly than expected in recent years, this slowing seems at best a partial 

explanation of the disappointing pace of the economic recovery.  In particular, even 

though the natural rate of unemployment may have increased somewhat, a variety of 

evidence suggests that any such increase has been modest, and that substantial slack 

remains in the labor market.  For example, the slow pace of employment growth has been 

widespread across industries and regions of the country.  That pattern suggests a broad-

based shortfall in demand rather than a substantial increase in mismatch between 

available jobs and workers, because greater mismatch would imply that the demand for 




- 5 -

workers would be strong in some regions and industries, not weak almost across the 

board.  Likewise, if a mismatch of jobs and workers is the predominant problem, we 

would expect to see wage pressures developing in those regions and industries where 

labor demand is strong; in fact, wage gains have been quite subdued in most industries 

and parts of the country.4  Indeed, as I indicated earlier, the consensus among my 

colleagues on the FOMC is that the unemployment rate is still well above its longer-run 

sustainable level, perhaps by 2 to 2-1/2 percentage points or so.5   

A critical question, then, is why significant slack in the job market remains three 

years after the recovery began.  A likely explanation, which I will discuss further, is that 

the economy has been faced with a variety of headwinds that have hindered what 

otherwise might have been a stronger cyclical rebound.  If so, we may take some 

encouragement from the likelihood that there are potentially two sources of faster GDP 

growth in the future.  First, the effects of the crisis on potential output should fade as the 

economy continues to heal.6  And second, if the headwinds begin to dissipate, as I expect, 

                                                 
4 In addition, while the changing relationship between job vacancies and unemployment--the shift in the 
Beveridge curve--probably does point to some greater difficulty matching jobs with workers, factors other 
than mismatch likely explain some of that shift.  For example, evidence suggests that firms tend to become 
more selective in hiring when their hiring needs are not urgent.  For further discussion of these labor market 
issues, see Bernanke, “Recent Developments,” in note 3 and the references cited therein.  See also Edward 
P. Lazear and James R. Spletzer (2012), “The United States Labor Market:  Status Quo or a New Normal?” 
paper delivered at “The Changing Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 30-September 1, 
www.kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/el-js.pdf. 
5 In the September 2012 Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), the central tendency of FOMC 
participants’ estimates of the long-run normal rate of unemployment ranged from 5.2 to 6 percent.  The 
SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (2012), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, September 12-13, 2012,” press release, 
October 4, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121004a.htm.  
6 For example, mismatch problems in the labor market should fade as the economy strengthens, a further 
rise in business investment would contribute to faster growth in the capital stock, and an improving 
economy should cause investors to become less risk averse.

growth should pick up further as many who are currently unemployed or out of the labor 

force find work.    

Headwinds Affecting the Recovery 

What are the headwinds that have slowed the return of our economy to full 

employment?  Some have come from the housing sector.  Previous recoveries have often 

been associated with a vigorous rebound in housing, as rising incomes and confidence 

and, often, a decline in mortgage interest rates led to sharp increases in the demand for 

homes.7  But the housing bubble and its aftermath have made this episode quite different.  

In the first half of the past decade, both housing prices and construction rose to what 

proved to be unsustainable levels, leading to a subsequent collapse:  House prices 

declined almost one-third nationally from 2006 until early this year, construction of 

single-family homes fell two-thirds, and the number of construction jobs decreased by 

nearly one-third.  And, of course, the associated surge in delinquencies on mortgages 

helped trigger the broader financial crisis. 

Recently, the housing market has shown some clear signs of improvement, as 

home sales, prices, and construction have all moved up since early this year.  These 

developments are encouraging, and it seems likely that, on net, residential investment 

will be a source of economic growth and new jobs over the next couple of years.  

However, while historically low mortgage interest rates and the drop in home prices have 

made housing exceptionally affordable, a number of factors continue to prevent the sort 

of powerful housing recovery that has typically occurred in the past.  Notably, lenders 

                                                 
7 In the recoveries following the 1975 and 1982 recessions, for example, residential construction directly 
contributed about 1 percentage point to GDP growth during the two years following the recession trough; 
indirect effects--through the effect of home prices on consumer spending or through multiplier effects--no 
doubt added to the contribution.

have maintained tight terms and conditions on mortgage loans, even for potential 

borrowers with relatively good credit.8  Lenders cite a number of factors affecting their 

decisions to extend credit, including ongoing uncertainties about the course of the 

economy, the housing market, and the regulatory environment.  Unfortunately, while 

some tightening of the terms of mortgage credit was certainly an appropriate response to 

the earlier excesses, the pendulum appears to have swung too far, restraining the pace of 

recovery in the housing sector.   

Other factors slowing the recovery in housing include the fact that many people 

remain unable to buy homes despite low mortgage rates; for example, about 20 percent of 

existing mortgage borrowers owe more on their mortgages than their houses are worth, 

making it more difficult for them to refinance or sell their homes.  Also, a substantial 

overhang of vacant homes, either for sale or in the foreclosure pipeline, continues to hold 

down house prices and reduce the need for new construction.  While these headwinds on 

both the supply and demand sides of the housing market have clearly started to abate, the 

recovery in the housing sector is likely to remain moderate by historical standards. 

A second set of headwinds stems from the financial conditions facing potential 

borrowers in credit and capital markets.  After the financial system seized up in late 2008 

and early 2009, global economic activity contracted sharply, and credit and capital 

markets suffered significant damage.  Although dramatic actions by governments and 

central banks around the world helped these markets to stabilize and begin recovering, 

                                                 
8 For example, according to the April 2012 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending, about 
one-half of lenders reported that they were “somewhat less likely” or “much less likely” than in 2006 to 
originate a mortgage to a borrower with a FICO score of 680 and a 10 percent down payment.  The 
complete survey is available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/snloansurvey/201205/default.htm.

tight credit and a high degree of risk aversion have restrained economic growth in the 

United States and in other countries as well. 

Measures of the condition of U.S. financial markets and institutions suggest 

gradual but significant progress has been achieved since the crisis.  For example, credit 

spreads on corporate bonds and syndicated loans have narrowed considerably, and equity 

prices have recovered most of their losses.  In addition, indicators of market stress and 

illiquidity--such as spreads in short-term funding markets--have generally returned to 

levels near those seen before the crisis.  One gauge of the overall improvement in 

financial markets is the National Financial Conditions Index maintained by the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Chicago.  The index shows that financial conditions, viewed as a whole, 

are now about as accommodative as they were in the spring of 2007. 

In spite of this broad improvement, the harm inflicted by the financial crisis has 

yet to be fully repaired in important segments of the financial sector.  One example is the 

continued weakness in some categories of bank lending.  Banks’ capital positions and 

overall asset quality have improved substantially over the past several years, and, over 

time, these balance sheet improvements will position banks to extend considerably more 

credit to bank-dependent borrowers.  Indeed, some types of bank credit, such as 

commercial and industrial loans, have expanded notably in recent quarters.  Nonetheless, 

banks have been conservative in extending loans to many consumers and some 

businesses, likely even beyond the restrictions on the supply of mortgage lending that I 

noted earlier.  This caution in lending by banks reflects, among other factors, their 

continued desire to guard against the risks of further economic weakness.

A prominent risk at present--and a major source of financial headwinds over the 

past couple of years--is the fiscal and financial situation in Europe.  This situation, of 

course, was not anticipated when the U.S. recovery began in 2009.  The elevated levels of 

stress in European economies and uncertainty about how the problems there will be 

resolved are adding to the risks that U.S. financial institutions, businesses, and 

households must consider when making lending and investment decisions.  Negative 

sentiment regarding Europe appears to have weighed on U.S. equity prices and prevented 

U.S. credit spreads from narrowing even further.  Weaker economic conditions in Europe 

and other parts of the world have also weighed on U.S. exports and corporate earnings. 

 Policymakers in Europe have taken some important steps recently, and in doing 

so have contributed to some welcome easing of financial conditions.  In particular, the 

European Central Bank’s new Outright Monetary Transactions program, under which it 

could purchase the sovereign debt of vulnerable euro-area countries who agree to meet 

prescribed conditions, has helped ease market concerns about those countries.  European 

governments have also taken steps to strengthen their financial firewalls and to move 

toward greater fiscal and banking union.  Further improvement in global financial 

conditions will depend in part on the extent to which European policymakers follow 

through on these initiatives. 

 A third headwind to the recovery--and one that may intensify in force in coming 

quarters--is U.S. fiscal policy.  Although fiscal policy at the federal level was quite 

expansionary during the recession and early in the recovery, as the recovery proceeded, 

the support provided for the economy by federal fiscal actions was increasingly offset by 

the adverse effects of tight budget conditions for state and local governments.  In 




- 10 -

response to a large and sustained decline in their tax revenues, state and local 

governments have cut about 600,000 jobs on net since the third quarter of 2008 while 

reducing real expenditures for infrastructure projects by 20 percent.   

More recently, the situation has to some extent reversed:  The drag on economic 

growth from state and local fiscal policy has diminished as revenues have improved, 

easing the pressures for further spending cuts or tax increases.  In contrast, the phasing-

out of earlier stimulus programs and policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit 

have led federal fiscal policy to begin restraining GDP growth.  Indeed, under almost any 

plausible scenario, next year the drag from federal fiscal policy on GDP growth will 

outweigh the positive effects on growth from fiscal expansion at the state and local level.  

However, the overall effect of federal fiscal policy on the economy, both in the near term 

and in the longer run, remains quite uncertain and depends on how policymakers meet 

two daunting fiscal challenges--one by the start of the new year and the other no later 

than the spring. 

Upcoming Fiscal Challenges 

What are these looming challenges?  First, the Congress and the Administration 

will need to protect the economy from the full brunt of the severe fiscal tightening at the 

beginning of next year that is built into current law--the so-called fiscal cliff.  The 

realization of all of the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that make up the fiscal 

cliff, absent offsetting changes, would pose a substantial threat to the recovery--indeed, 

by the reckoning of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and that of many outside 

observers, a fiscal shock of that size would send the economy toppling back into 

recession.  Second, early in the new year it will be necessary to approve an increase in the 




- 11 -

federal debt limit to avoid any possibility of a catastrophic default on the nation’s 

Treasury securities and other obligations.  As you will recall, the threat of default in the 

summer of 2011 fueled economic uncertainty and badly damaged confidence, even 

though an agreement ultimately was reached.  A failure to reach a timely agreement this 

time around could impose even heavier economic and financial costs. 

As fiscal policymakers face these critical decisions, they should keep two 

objectives in mind.  First, as I think is widely appreciated by now, the federal budget is 

on an unsustainable path.  The budget deficit, which peaked at about 10 percent of GDP 

in 2009 and now stands at about 7 percent of GDP, is expected to narrow further in the 

coming years as the economy continues to recover.  However, the CBO projects that, 

under a plausible set of policy assumptions, the budget deficit would still be greater than 

4 percent of GDP in 2018, assuming the economy has returned to its potential by then.  

Moreover, under the CBO projection, the deficit and the ratio of federal debt to GDP 

would subsequently return to an upward trend.9  Of course, we should all understand that 

long-term projections of ever-increasing deficits will never actually come to pass, 

because the willingness of lenders to continue to fund the government can only be 

sustained by responsible fiscal plans and actions.  A credible framework to set federal 

fiscal policy on a stable path--for example, one on which the ratio of federal debt to GDP 

eventually stabilizes or declines--is thus urgently needed to ensure longer-term economic 

growth and stability. 

                                                 
9 This projection is the alternative fiscal scenario in a CBO report from August of this year.  See 
Congressional Budget Office (2012), An Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook:  Fiscal Years 2012 
to 2022 (Washington:  CBO, August), available at www.cbo.gov/publication/43539. 




- 12 -

Even as fiscal policymakers address the urgent issue of longer-run fiscal 

sustainability, they should not ignore a second key objective:  to avoid unnecessarily 

adding to the headwinds that are already holding back the economic recovery.  

Fortunately, the two objectives are fully compatible and mutually reinforcing.  Preventing 

a sudden and severe contraction in fiscal policy early next year will support the transition 

of the economy back to full employment; a stronger economy will in turn reduce the 

deficit and contribute to achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.  At the same time, a 

credible plan to put the federal budget on a path that will be sustainable in the long run 

could help keep longer-term interest rates low and boost household and business 

confidence, thereby supporting economic growth today. 

Coming together to find fiscal solutions will not be easy, but the stakes are high.  

Uncertainty about how the fiscal cliff, the raising of the debt limit, and the longer-term 

budget situation will be addressed appears already to be affecting private spending and 

investment decisions and may be contributing to an increased sense of caution in 

financial markets, with adverse effects on the economy.  Continuing to push off difficult 

policy choices will only prolong and intensify these uncertainties.  Moreover, while the 

details of whatever agreement is reached to resolve the fiscal cliff are important, the 

economic confidence of both market participants and the general public likely will also 

be influenced by the extent to which our political system proves able to deliver a 

reasonable solution with a minimum of uncertainty and delay.  Finding long-term 

solutions that can win sufficient political support to be enacted may take some time, but 

meaningful progress toward this end can be achieved now if policymakers are willing to 

think creatively and work together constructively.

Monetary Policy 

Let me now turn briefly to monetary policy. 

Monetary policy can do little to reverse the effects that the financial crisis may 

have had on the economy’s productive potential.  However, it has been able to provide an 

important offset to the headwinds that have slowed the cyclical recovery.  As you know, 

the Federal Reserve took strong easing measures during the financial crisis and recession, 

cutting its target for the federal funds rate--the traditional tool of monetary policy--to 

nearly zero by the end of 2008.  Since that time, we have provided additional 

accommodation through two nontraditional policy tools aimed at putting downward 

pressure on longer-term interest rates:  asset purchases that reduce the supply of longer-

term securities outstanding in the market, and communication about the future path of 

monetary policy. 

Most recently, after the September FOMC meeting, we announced that the 

Federal Reserve would purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) 

and continue with the program to extend the maturity of our Treasury holdings.10  These 

additional asset purchases should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates 

and make broader financial conditions more accommodative.11  Moreover, our purchases 

                                                 
10 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Federal Reserve Issues FOMC 
Statement,” press release, September 13, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120913a.htm. 
11 One way in which our asset purchases affect the economy is through the so-called portfolio balance 
channel.  Because different classes of financial assets are not perfect substitutes in investors’ portfolios, 
changes in the supplies of various assets available to private investors may affect the prices and yields of 
those assets.  Thus, the Federal Reserve’s purchases of Treasury securities, for example, should raise the 
prices and lower the yields of those securities; moreover, as investors rebalance their portfolios by 
replacing the Treasury securities sold to the Federal Reserve with other assets, the prices of those other 
assets should rise and their yields decline as well.  An increase in our asset purchases may also act as a 
signal that we intend to pursue a persistently more accommodative policy stance than previously thought, 
thereby lowering investors’ expectations for the future path of the federal funds rate and putting additional 
downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.

of MBS, by bringing down mortgage rates, provide support directly to housing and 

thereby help mitigate some of the headwinds facing that sector.  In announcing this 

decision, we also indicated that we would continue purchasing MBS, undertake 

additional purchases of longer-term securities, and employ our other policy tools until we 

judge that the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of 

price stability.   

Although it is still too early to assess the full effects of our most recent policy 

actions, yields on corporate bonds and agency MBS have fallen significantly, on balance, 

since the FOMC’s announcement.  More generally, research suggests that our previous 

asset purchases have eased overall financial conditions and provided meaningful support 

to the economic recovery in recent years.12 

In addition to announcing new purchases of MBS, at our September meeting we 

extended our guidance for how long we expect that exceptionally low levels for the 

federal funds rate will likely be warranted at least through the middle of 2015.  By

pushing the expected period of low rates further into the future, we are not saying that we 

expect the economy to remain weak until mid-2015; rather, we expect--as we indicated in 

our September statement--that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will 

remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.13  In 

other words, we will want to be sure that the recovery is established before we begin to 

normalize policy.  We hope that such assurances will reduce uncertainty and increase 

confidence among households and businesses, thereby providing additional support for 

economic growth and job creation. 

Conclusion 

In sum, the U.S. economy continues to be hampered by the lingering effects of the 

financial crisis on its productive potential and by a number of headwinds that have 

hindered the normal cyclical adjustment of the economy.  The Federal Reserve is doing 

its part by providing accommodative monetary policy to promote a stronger economic 

recovery in a context of price stability.  As I have said before, however, while monetary 

policy can help support the economic recovery, it is by no means a panacea for our 

economic ills.  Currently, uncertainties about the situation in Europe and especially about 

the prospects for federal fiscal policy seem to be weighing on the spending decisions of 

households and businesses as well as on financial conditions.  Such uncertainties will 

only be increased by discord and delay.  In contrast, cooperation and creativity to deliver 

fiscal clarity--in particular, a plan for resolving the nation’s longer-term budgetary issues 

without harming the recovery--could help make the new year a very good one for the 

American economy.
