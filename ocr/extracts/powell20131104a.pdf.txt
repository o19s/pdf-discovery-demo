Prospects for Asia and the Global Economy

I appreciate this opportunity to offer a few thoughts on the effects of advanced 

economy monetary policies on emerging market economies (EMEs)--an issue of great 

importance for Asia and the global economy.1  Since the global financial crisis, the 

Federal Reserve has sought to strengthen the U.S. economic recovery through highly 

accommodative monetary policy.  But my colleagues and I are keenly aware that the U.S. 

economy operates in a global environment.  We understand that America’s prosperity is 

bound up with the prosperity of other nations, including emerging market nations.   

Emerging market economies have long grappled with the challenges posed by 

large and volatile cross-border capital flows.  The past several decades are replete with 

episodes of strong capital inflows being followed by abrupt reversals, all too often 

resulting in financial crisis and economic distress.2  Some of this volatility no doubt 

reflects the evolution of strengths and vulnerabilities within the EMEs themselves.   

In recent years, renewed attention has been placed on the role of advanced 

economies and of common or global factors in driving capital movements.3  In particular, 

many observers have singled out monetary policy in the United States and other 

advanced economies as a key driver.  As advanced economies pursued highly 

accommodative monetary policies and EMEs subsequently received strong capital 

inflows, reflecting investors’ pursuit of higher returns, concerns were expressed that a 

flood of liquidity would overwhelm emerging markets, drive up asset prices to 

unsustainable levels, set off credit booms, and thus sow the seeds of future crises.  More 
                                                 
1 I would like to thank Trevor Reeve for his assistance in the preparation of these remarks. 
2 Notable examples of such crises include Latin America in the early 1980s, Mexico in 1994, the Asian 
financial crises beginning in 1997, Russia in 1998, Argentina in 2001, and Brazil in 2002.  See Broner and 
others (2013), Forbes and Warnock (2012), Ghosh and others (2012), and Reinhart and Reinhart (2009) for 
discussions of large capital flow movements. 
3 An earlier literature also examined the role of “push” and “pull” factors in explaining international capital 
flows.  Examples include Calvo and others (1993, 1996), Fernandez-Arias (1996), and Chuhan and others 
(1998).

recently, there have been concerns about potential financial and economic dislocations 

associated with the advanced economies’ eventual exit from highly accommodative 

policies.   

In my remarks today, I will discuss the extent to which monetary policy in the 

advanced economies--and in the United States in particular--has contributed to changes in 

emerging market capital flows and asset prices, and I will place this discussion in a 

broader context of economic and financial linkages among economies.  I will also address 

the risks that EMEs may face from the eventual normalization of monetary policy in the 

advanced economies.   

The heightened attention to advanced economies’ monetary policies and the 

potential spillovers to EMEs is understandable in light of the unprecedented policy steps 

taken in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.  The severity of the crisis and the 

challenge of a slow recovery required central banks in the advanced economies and 

elsewhere to take aggressive action in order to fulfill their mandates.  In the United 

States, the Federal Reserve is bound by its dual mandate to pursue price stability and 

maximum employment.  In following that mandate, the Fed cut the federal funds rate to 

its effective lower bound in late 2008 and then turned to two less conventional policy 

tools to provide additional monetary accommodation.  The first is forward guidance on 

the federal funds rate.  By lowering private-sector expectations for the future path of 

short-term rates, forward guidance has reduced longer-term interest rates and raised asset 

prices, thereby leading to more accommodative financial conditions.  The second tool is 

large scale asset purchases, which likewise increase policy accommodation by reducing 

longer-term interest rates and raising asset prices. 


 - 3 - 

The Federal Reserve has not been alone in implementing unconventional 

monetary policies.  The Bank of England has also engaged in substantial asset purchases 

and recently introduced explicit forward guidance for its policy rate.  The Bank of Japan, 

a pioneer in the use of unconventional policy, has recently embarked on an ambitious 

asset purchase program to combat deflation.  And the European Central Bank (ECB) 

substantially extended its liquidity provision by offering unlimited longer-term 

refinancing operations.  The ECB also purchased some securities in distressed markets, 

and recently indicated that it expects interest rates to remain low for an extended period. 

Thus, since the end of the crisis, central banks in the advanced economies have adopted 

similar policies to promote recovery and price stability. 

While a great deal of attention has focused on unconventional policy actions, 

especially asset purchases, these policies appear to affect financial conditions and the real 

economy in much the same way as conventional interest rate policy.  Indeed, recent 

research suggests that adjustments in policy rates and unconventional policies have 

similar cross-border effects on asset prices and economic outcomes.4  If that is so, then 

the overall stance of policy accommodation matters more here than the particular form of 

easing.  Moreover, neither conventional nor unconventional monetary policy actions are 

shocks that come out of the blue.  Instead, they are the policies undertaken by central 

banks to offset the adverse shocks that have restrained our economies.   Thus, any 

spillovers from monetary policy actions must be evaluated against the consequences of 

failing to respond to these adverse shocks. 

                                                 
4 See Glick and Leduc (2013), IMF (2013a), Moore and others (2013), Rosa (2012), and Wu and Xia 
(2013).  Recent research by Federal Reserve Board staff finds that reductions in U.S. interest rates for any 
reason--whether caused by monetary policy or other factors--have typically been associated with declines 
in EME interest rates and appreciation of EME currencies.  Moore and others (2013) document a similar 
historical relationship. 


 - 4 - 

In a world of global trade and integrated capital markets, it is natural for 

economic and financial shocks and policy actions to be transmitted across borders.  

Spillovers from advanced-economy monetary policies are to be expected.5  In theory, 

when advanced economies ease monetary policy in response to a contractionary shock, 

their interest rates will decline, prompting investors to rebalance their portfolios toward 

higher-yielding assets.  Some of this rebalancing will occur domestically, but some 

investment will also move abroad, resulting in capital flows to EMEs.  In response, EME 

currencies should tend to appreciate against those of the advanced economies, and EME 

asset prices should rise.  Conversely, a tightening of advanced economy monetary policy 

in response to a stronger economy should lead these movements to reverse; that is, 

tightening should reduce capital flows to EMEs and diminish upward pressure on EME 

currencies and asset prices.   

Are these basic relationships apparent in the data?  The left side of chart 1 shows 

an index of EME local-currency sovereign bond yields along with a roughly similar 

maturity U.S. Treasury yield.  The line on the right is the differential between the two, 

plotted against net inflows of private capital to a selection of EMEs, shown by the bars.  

If interest rates were the main driver of capital flows, these two series ought to move in a 

similar fashion.  At times, this is indeed the case:  From mid-2009 to early 2011, the 

interest rate differential and EME capital inflows rose together.  But the overall 

relationship is not particularly tight.  In early 2007, capital flows to EMEs were quite 

strong even with a low interest rate differential.  And in mid-2011, capital inflows 

stepped down even as the interest rate differential remained elevated.  As I will discuss in 

                                                 
5 The U.S. economy is affected by spillovers from abroad as well, and these are very much a part of our 
policymaking environment.  


 - 5 - 

a moment, the lack of a tight relationship between capital flows and interest rates 

suggests that other factors also have been important. 

Even though interest-rate differentials and capital inflows do not always move in 

the same direction, numerous empirical studies have shown that interest rates do in fact 

help explain capital flows once other determinants of these flows are also taken into 

account.6  In particular, when U.S. rates decline relative to those in EMEs, private capital 

flows to EMEs tend to rise, consistent with investors rebalancing toward higher-yielding 

assets.  In a similar vein, event studies have shown that the Federal Reserve’s policy 

announcements, including those related to asset purchases, have been associated with 

capital flows to EMEs as well as upward movements in EME currencies and asset 

prices.7  But the role of monetary policy in driving capital flows and the effects of those 

flows on EMEs should not be overstated.  In this regard, I will offer two considerations. 

First, many factors affect capital flows to EMEs, not just the stance of advanced 

economy monetary policy.  Differences in growth prospects across countries and the 

associated differences in expected investment returns are important factors.8  Chart 2 

shows the growth rate of real GDP for EMEs and advanced economies.  Given their stage 

of development and demographic profile, EMEs should grow faster than advanced 

economies on a trend basis.  As shown by the line in the right panel, EME growth has, in 

fact, consistently outpaced that of the advanced economies.  In addition, the bounceback 

of the EMEs from the global financial crisis widened this differential even more, 

                                                 
6 See, for example, Ahmed and Zlate (2013), Bluedorn and others (2013), Fratzcher and others (2013), 
Ghosh and others (2012), and IMF (2011).  
7 See Chen and others (2012), Fratzscher and others (2013), Hausman and Wongswan (2011), IMF 
(2013b), and Moore and others (2013).

others (2012).

although the gap has diminished more recently as growth in the EMEs has slowed.  

Moreover, investing in EMEs has become more attractive as many EMEs have improved 

their macroeconomic policies and institutional frameworks over recent decades; growth 

differentials may partly be reflecting these improvements.  As is evident in the right-hand 

chart, the relationship between the growth differential and capital inflows to EMEs seems 

to be quite strong.  In particular, the rise in capital flows following the global financial 

crisis coincided with stronger relative growth performance in EMEs.  And in 2011, 

capital inflows diminished along with the growth differential.   

Another key driver of EME capital flows is global attitude toward risk.  Swings in 

sentiment between “risk-on” and “risk-off” have led investors to reposition across asset 

classes, resulting in corresponding movements in capital flows.9  Indeed, as shown in 

chart 3, the most common measure of uncertainty and the market price of volatility--the 

VIX--is strongly correlated with net inflows into EMEs.  Although the causes of 

movements in global risk sentiment are uncertain, the ebb and flow of potential crises and 

policy responses, such as we experienced during the European crisis, are clearly 

important.  Of course, movements in risk sentiment may not be fully independent of 

monetary policy.  An interesting line of research has begun to consider how changes in 

monetary policy itself may affect risk sentiment.  For example, some studies indicate that 

an easing of U.S. monetary policy tends to lower volatility (as measured by the VIX), 

increase leverage of financial intermediaries, and boost EME capital inflows and 

currencies.10

A second point to bear in mind when assessing monetary policy spillovers is that 

expansionary policies in the advanced economies are not beggar-thy-neighbor; in other 

words, they do not undermine exports from EMEs.  In recent decades, some EMEs have 

successfully pursued an export-led growth strategy, and policymakers in those economies 

have sometimes expressed concern that their exports will be unduly restrained as 

accommodative policies in the advanced economies lead their currencies to appreciate.  

However, as shown in chart 4, although EME currencies bounced back from their lows 

during the global financial crisis--when global investors fled from assets they perceived 

to be risky--for many EMEs real exchange rates have moved sideways or have even 

declined over the past two years.  Some of this weakness may reflect the foreign 

exchange market intervention and capital controls that policymakers used to staunch the 

rise in their currencies.   

But even if advanced economy monetary policies were to put upward pressure on 

EME currencies, the consequent drag on their exports must be weighed against the 

positive effects of stronger demand in the advanced economies.  According to 

simulations of the Federal Reserve Board’s econometric models of the global economy, 

these two effects roughly offset each other, suggesting that accommodative monetary 

policies in the advanced economies have not reduced output and exports in the EMEs.11  

Indeed, this view seems to be supported by recent experience, as the U.S. current account 

balance has remained fairly stable since the end of the global financial crisis.   Over the 

longer run, advanced economy policy actions that strengthen global growth and global 

trade will benefit the EMEs as well. 

                                                 
11 See Bernanke (2013). 


 - 8 - 

A particularly important consideration regarding spillovers from accommodative 

monetary policies in the advanced economies is the extent to which such policies 

contribute to financial stability risks in the EMEs.  Because many EMEs have financial 

sectors that are relatively small, large capital inflows may foster asset price bubbles and a 

too-rapid expansion of credit.  These are serious concerns, irrespective of the relative 

importance of monetary policies in the advanced economies in driving these flows.  

While the picture is a mixed one and some markets show signs of froth, indicators of 

financial stability do not seem to show widespread imbalances.12   

For example, EME equity prices, shown in chart 5, plunged during the global 

financial crisis, rebounded thereafter, but then generally flattened out or even declined.  

There are exceptions, of course, such as Indonesia, whose stock market soared until 

earlier this year.  But in aggregate, EME stock prices remain below their pre-crisis peak, 

whereas the S&P 500 is well above its own pre-crisis peak.   

Chart 6 portrays the rise in credit to the domestic nonfinancial private sector as a 

share of GDP from its pre-crisis level.  For some EMEs, the rise in credit does not seem 

out of line with historical trends, but some economies have experienced potentially 

worrisome increases.  Credit growth in China is particularly noteworthy, but this does not 

seem to be the result of accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies.  

Much of the rise took place in the aftermath of the crisis, in large part reflecting policy-

driven stimulus to support economic recovery.  In addition, China’s relatively closed 

capital account limits the extent to which domestic credit conditions are influenced by 

developments abroad, including changes in advanced economy monetary policy.  

Increases in credit in some other economies, notably Brazil, have also been driven to a 
                                                 
12 See IMF (2013a, 2013b). 


 - 9 - 

significant degree by policy actions to support aggregate demand.  And, of course, EMEs 

have policy tools to limit the expansion of credit. 

Another area of potential concern is excessive valuations in property markets.  

Chart 7 displays inflation-adjusted house prices for several Asian economies.  The most 

striking increases have occurred in Hong Kong, which, through its open capital account 

and essentially fixed exchange rate, is tied most directly to U.S. financial conditions.  Of 

course, the degree of Hong Kong’s exposure to U.S. financial conditions is a policy 

choice, and other factors have also contributed to the run-up in its property prices.  House 

prices have also resumed their rise in China.  But, as with credit growth, this rise seems to 

reflect domestic developments as opposed to spillovers from global financial conditions. 

In light of these potential financial stability concerns, it is encouraging that EME 

policymakers have devoted substantial effort since the Asian financial crisis of the late 

1990s to bolster the resilience of their banking systems.  Banks in many EMEs have 

robust earnings and solid capital buffers.13  Compared with past experience, emerging 

market banking systems also generally enjoy improved management and a proactive 

approach by authorities to mitigate risks.  Nevertheless, in an environment of volatile 

global markets, regulators should guard against the buildup of vulnerabilities, such as 

excessive dependence on wholesale and external funding, declining asset quality, and 

foreign currency mismatches. 

To summarize my discussion so far, EMEs clearly face challenges from volatile 

capital flows and the attendant moves in asset prices.  Accommodative monetary policies 

in the advanced economies have likely contributed to some of these flow and price 

pressures, and may also have contributed to the buildup of some financial vulnerabilities 
                                                 
13 See IMF (2013a).

in certain emerging markets.  That said, other factors appear to have been even more 

important.  Moreover, expansionary monetary policies in the advanced economies have 

supported global growth to the benefit of advanced and emerging economies alike. 

Turning to the risks and policy challenges going forward, much attention has 

focused on potential effects in EMEs when recovery prompts the United States and other 

advanced economies to begin the gradual process of returning policy to a normal stance.  

As events over the summer demonstrated, even the discussion of such a policy shift may 

be accompanied by considerable volatility. 

As shown in chart 8, from May through August, U.S. Treasury yields rose 

substantially as market participants reassessed the future course of U.S. monetary policy.  

In response, EME bond and equity funds experienced very large outflows, as shown by 

the bars.  EME yields rose as well, in some cases by more than those on Treasury 

securities, and many EME currencies depreciated.  The magnitude of these market 

responses may have been amplified by the carry-trade strategies that many investors had 

in place; these strategies were designed to take advantage of interest rate differentials and 

appeared profitable as long as EME interest rate differentials remained wide and EME 

exchange rates remained stable or were expected to appreciate.  When anticipations of 

Fed tapering led to higher U.S. interest rates and higher market volatility, these trades 

may have been quickly unwound, engendering particularly sharp declines in EME 

exchange rates and asset prices.   

These developments, however, do not appear to have been driven solely by 

perceptions of U.S. monetary policy.  As I noted earlier, GDP growth in many EMEs has 

fallen from the pace of previous years, which may have led investors to rethink their 


 - 11 - 

investment choices.  Additionally, it appears that the retreat from emerging markets 

reflected a change in global risk sentiment, as investors focused on vulnerabilities in 

EMEs following a period of complacency.  Asset prices have fallen considerably more in 

economies with large current account deficits, high inflation, and fiscal problems than in 

countries with stronger fundamentals.  For example, as shown in chart 9, changes in EME 

exchange rates and interest rates since April have been correlated with current account 

deficits.  In general, economies with larger current account deficits experienced greater 

depreciations of their currencies and larger increases in their bond yields.  Thus, while a 

reassessment of U.S. monetary policy may have triggered the recent retrenchment from 

EMEs, investor concerns about underlying vulnerabilities appear to have amplified the 

reaction. 

Whatever their source, large capital outflows from EMEs can pose challenges for 

EME policymakers by simultaneously producing significant currency depreciation, asset 

price deflation, and inflationary pressures.  In such cases, EME central banks are in the 

difficult position of judging whether to tighten policy at the same time that demand is 

weakening.  It is notable that some central banks with stronger records on price stability 

have been able to avoid tightening whereas others have been forced to raise rates to 

defend price stability in the face of domestic weakness.   

Monetary policy in the United States is likely to remain highly accommodative 

for some time, as our economy fights to overcome the remaining headwinds from the 

global financial crisis.  As our economic recovery continues, however, the time will come 

to gradually reduce the pace of asset purchases and eventually bring those purchases to a 


 - 12 - 

stop.  The timing of this moderation in the pace of purchases is necessarily uncertain, as it 

depends on the evolution of the economy.   

While moderating the pace of purchases and the eventual increase in the federal 

funds rate may well affect capital flows, interest rates and asset prices in EMEs, the 

overall macroeconomic effects need not be disruptive.  First, tightening will in all 

likelihood occur in the context of a more firmly established economic recovery in the 

United States so that any adverse effects on EME financial conditions should be buffered 

by the beneficial effects of higher external demand.  Second, although conditions vary 

from country to country, on the whole, EMEs exhibit greater resilience than they did in 

prior decades, reflecting, among other factors, more flexible exchange rates, greater 

stocks of international reserves, stronger fiscal positions, and better regulated and more 

conservatively managed banking systems.  

EMEs have policy tools to help manage any negative externalities that may arise, 

and recent developments provide additional rationale for them to redouble their efforts to 

bolster their resiliency.14  Reducing vulnerabilities, improving policy frameworks, and 

safeguarding the financial sector will go a long way toward making EMEs more robust to 

a wide range of shocks, not just those that may arise from changes in monetary policy in 

the advanced economies.  Global investors should also learn from the experience of this 

summer, when it became clear that unwinding leveraged carry trades can be difficult in 

an environment of lower liquidity. 

As for advanced economies, policymakers should move gradually to restore 

normal policies only as their economic recoveries are more firmly established, consistent 

with their mandates.  In addition, policymakers should communicate as clearly as 
                                                 
14 See Sanchez (2013).

possible about their policy aims and intentions in order to limit the odds of policy 

surprises and a consequent sharp adjustment in financial markets in response.  Indeed, my 

colleagues on the FOMC and I are committed to just such an approach. 

In closing, the Federal Reserve’s mandate, like those of other central banks, is 

focused on the pursuit of domestic policy objectives.  This focus is entirely appropriate.  

Yet, experience has shown that the fortunes of the U.S. economy are deeply intertwined 

with those of the rest of the world.  Economic prospects for the United States are 

importantly influenced by the course of the world economy, and, by the same token, 

prosperity around the globe depends to a significant extent on a strong U.S. economy.  In 

order for the Federal Reserve to fulfill its dual mandate of price stability and maximum 

employment, we must take account of these international linkages.  Indeed, the Federal 

Reserve has a long and varied history of doing so, including our actions during the global 

financial crisis.  There is every reason to expect that to continue.15  

Thank you.  I’ll be happy to take a few questions or comments.
