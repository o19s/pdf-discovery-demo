on Evaluating Macroprudential Tools:  Complementarities and Conflicts 
 

Arlington, Virginia

Standing in front of this audience I feel secure in observing that we are all 

macroprudentialists now.  The imperative of fashioning a regulatory regime that focuses on the 

financial system as a whole, and not just the well-being of individual firms, is now quite broadly 

accepted.  Indeed, the two entities co-sponsoring this conference were themselves created by the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which reoriented financial 

regulation toward safeguarding financial stability by containing systemic risk--an aim that may 

not define all of macroprudential policy, but surely rests at its center. 

  But beneath the high-level consensus for a macroprudential orientation lies a broad range 

of substantive views, as well as a host of analytic and practical questions, which form the subject 

of this conference and many like it.  Experience with macroprudential policy measures in various 

countries is not extensive and may, in any case, have only limited applicability elsewhere 

because of differences in economic conditions, the relative importance of capital market and 

traditional bank intermediation, and many other factors.  And there is sometimes a tendency to 

overlook the significance of institutional and legal considerations in fashioning and comparing 

macroprudential policies.  If macroprudential policy is to be more than a catchphrase, 

policymakers must confront these considerations in specifying how a macroprudential 

perspective will inform financial regulation. 

 Today I would like to suggest some specific macroprudential objectives that I regard as 

both realistic and important to incorporate into a near- to medium-term policy agenda:  first, 

continuing the task of ensuring that very large, complex financial institutions do not threaten 

financial stability; second, developing policies to deal with leverage risks and susceptibility to 

runs in financial markets that are not fully contained within the universe of prudentially regulated 

firms; and third, dealing with the vulnerabilities associated with the growing importance of 

2 
 


central counterparties.  Before discussing these specifics, I will begin with some brief 

observations on macroprudential tools and, in particular, the special difficulties associated with 

time-varying macroprudential policies. 

The Varieties of Macroprudential Tools  

 In mapping out the range of macroprudential policies, analysts have developed various 

taxonomies.  Common to most is the distinction between tools designed to prevent systemic risk 

from building by “leaning against the wind” and tools designed to increase the resiliency of the 

financial system should systemic risk nonetheless build and lead to broad-based stress.  While 

some tools may straddle this distinction, it seems useful as a starting point for evaluating the 

utility of different measures.  As I have explained elsewhere, I think a distinction of equal--if not 

greater--importance is between structural or “through the cycle” tools, on the one hand, and time-

varying tools, on the other.1  Structural macroprudential tools are put in place as a part of the 

ongoing regulatory structure, but they are designed specifically from a systemic, as opposed to a 

firm- or asset-specific, perspective. 

 Many proponents of macroprudential policy seem particularly attracted to time-varying 

measures for both resiliency and lean-against-wind measures.  The aim is to regulate in an 

explicitly countercyclical fashion through measures that attempt to restrain rapid, unsustainable 

increases in credit extension or asset prices--either directly or through shifts in incentives--and to 

relax those measures as economic conditions deteriorate.  One can readily understand the 

conceptual appeal of this approach, but it raises a fair number of significant issues--analytic, 

practical, institutional, and legal.  These include the reliability of measures of excess or systemic 

risk, the appropriate officials to be making macroprudential decisions, the speed with which

on Challenges in Global Financial Services, New Haven, Connecticut, September 20.

measures might realistically be implemented and take effect, and the right calibration of 

measures that will be efficacious in damping excesses while not unnecessarily reducing well-

underwritten credit flows in the economy. 

 Even if these issues could be addressed and a time-varying macroprudential measure 

developed and applied, there is some reason to believe that regulatory relaxation of such a 

requirement may not have much effect on the downside of an economic or financial cycle.  

Market discipline, which may have been lax in boom years, tends to become very strict when 

conditions deteriorate rapidly.  At that point, counterparties and investors may look unfavorably 

at a reduction in capital levels or margins or other protective measures, despite their formal 

elimination by regulators and despite the potential benefits for the economy as a whole. 

 None of this is to say that analysis of possible time-varying macroprudential tools should 

not continue.  Indeed, some are clearly appropriate for near-term use.  For example, since good 

prudential supervision must always be time-varying, we should continue to adapt oversight with 

a view to changing conditions.  And we will be working with the other banking regulators to 

build out the Basel III countercyclical capital buffer regime, which takes effect in the United 

States next year.  But as a realistic matter, the role of time-varying macroprudential tools is 

probably limited for the immediate future.    

At the same time, there is both considerable need and potential for completing or 

developing in the near- to medium-term what I have termed structural macroprudential measures.  

Of course, there are intellectual and practical challenges here as well, including the need to 

assess the impact of the measures on economic and financial activity in non-stress times.  But 

unlike time-varying measures, which often must be adopted swiftly to be effective, structural 

measures can be developed through a full and careful process, including normal administrative 

4 
 


law notice and comment procedures.  Additionally, where appropriate, the development of such 

measures can readily involve multiple regulatory authorities.  Let me turn now to what I regard 

as three priority areas for the application of macroprudential tools. 

Large Financial Institutions 

By definition, too-big-to-fail problems implicate systemic risk considerations and must 

be addressed in any regulatory system that seeks to preserve financial stability.  More generally, 

the dynamics observed during the financial crisis--including correlated asset holdings, common 

risks and exposures, and contagion among the largest firms--suggest that the well-being of any 

one of these firms cannot be isolated from the well-being of the banking system as a whole.  

Much of the post-crisis reform agenda has been centered on these institutions.  Various 

regulatory measures informed to a greater or lesser extent by macroprudential considerations 

have been developed and are now at various stages of implementation.  I will mention three of 

the most important. 

First is a set of strengthened capital standards, which fit squarely within the objective of 

increasing the resiliency of systemically important institutions.  Basel III fortified the 

microprudential requirements for both the quality and quantity of capital for all internationally 

active institutions.  But, both internationally and in the United States, the post-crisis reform 

agenda includes capital requirements derived in whole or in part from macroprudential aims.   

These include capital surcharges for systemically important firms and stress testing. 

Stress testing, unlike conventional capital requirements, provides a forward-looking 

assessment of losses that would be suffered under adverse economic scenarios.  Moreover, the 

related capital planning process helps ensure that the banking system would continue to have 

adequate capital to provide viable financial intermediation even in the face of adverse conditions. 

5 
 


The simultaneous testing of the largest firms using a supervisory model provides a perspective 

on a large part of the banking system and facilitates identification of correlated exposures and 

other common risks.  The supervisory construction of adverse scenarios each year allows us to 

incorporate changes in financial practices, vulnerabilities, and conditions into a dynamic capital 

standard.  For example, in recent tests, the Federal Reserve has assessed potential interest rate 

risk by analyzing how sensitive deposits will be to rate rises, whether banks might have to raise 

deposit rates more than expected to retain deposits, and whether banks that are hedging interest 

rate risk are all dealing with the same few counterparties. 

The system of risk-weighted capital surcharges adopted by the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision is a regulatory innovation designed to reduce the chances of distress or 

failure of “G-SIBs” (global systemically important institutions) to a greater degree than at other 

firms, in recognition of the fact that the resulting negative consequences for the financial system 

would likely be substantially more significant.  These surcharges are an important example of the 

principle, embodied in section 165(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, that prudential requirements 

should increase in stringency with the systemic importance of regulated firms.2  The surcharge 

applicable to institutions varies based on the relative systemic importance of a firm.   

As you are doubtless aware, the Federal Reserve has proposed for domestic 

implementation a range of surcharges higher, and somewhat differently calibrated, than the Basel 

framework.3  The approach to calibration we developed in cooperation with other Basel 

Committee members was to determine the additional capital necessary to equalize the probable 

2 Another capital measures applicable only to the eight most systemically significant U.S. institutions is a leverage 
ratio of 5 percent, which is higher than the international standard.  In light of increases in applicable risk-based 
capital requirements, this increase seemed warranted to maintain the traditional complementary relationship between 
these two forms of capital rules.

of Capital Requirements for Globally Systemic Important Bank Holding Companies,” notice of proposed

systemic impact from the failure of a systemically important bank, as compared to the probable 

systemic impact from the failure of a large, but not systemically important, bank.  However, the 

surcharge levels ultimately agreed to by the Basel Committee were toward the low end of the 

range suggested by this analysis.  The levels included in the proposed rule are more in the middle 

of that range and thus higher than the Basel surcharges.  As suggested in an economic impact 

analysis undertaken by Basel Committee members, this higher level of surcharges should 

provide substantial net economic benefits by reducing the risks of destabilizing failures of very 

large banking organizations.  The proposed rule would also take into account a firm’s relative 

dependence on short-term wholesale funding, a source of systemic vulnerability to which I will 

return a bit later in these remarks.  During the transition period for implementation of the G-SIB 

surcharges (as modified following the notice and comment process), the affected firms will 

presumably be considering whether they wish to reduce or alter the range, amount, or types of 

their activities so as to place themselves in a lower “risk bucket,” with a concomitantly lower 

capital surcharge. 

A second kind of post-crisis regulatory reform with a macroprudential influence is the 

new set of quantitative liquidity requirements, including the now-adopted liquidity coverage ratio 

(LCR) and the internationally agreed-upon net stable funding ratio (NSFR) soon to be considered 

for adoption by U.S. banking regulators.  Having just recently given an entire speech on the 

subject, I will note here only that both the LCR and the NSFR--along with the Federal Reserve’s 

annual Comprehensive Liquidity Assessment and Review--were motivated by the systemic 

liquidity squeeze experienced during the crisis.  Even though the LCR, for example, is 

principally microprudential in design, it still reflects macroprudential concerns, as in its 

exclusion of deposits with other banks from the set of assets that qualify as highly liquid.  And, 

7 
 


as in the requirements applicable to matched books of large firms that are important providers of 

liquidity to financial markets, some overtly macroprudential provisions have been incorporated 

in the NSFR.   

A third set of regulatory measures of relevance to systemic risks from large financial 

institutions concerns the potential failure of these institutions.  These include, among others, the 

orderly liquidation authority given the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) under title 

II of the Dodd-Frank Act and proposals to assure the availability of debt that is convertible into 

equity should a firm fail, thereby providing for absorption of losses and possible recapitalization 

without need for the injection of public capital.4  I suspect these and similar measures do not 

appear on many lists of macroprudential tools.  And it may be hard to decide whether to classify 

them as resiliency tools or as structural measures designed to retard the build-up of systemic risk.  

Yet, with their purposes of ensuring that even the largest firms can fail and be wound down in an 

orderly fashion, and of countering too-big-to-fail perceptions associated with systemically 

important financial institutions, they belong on those lists.   

One such tool that has gotten more attention in the past year is the resolution planning 

process established by section 165(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Federal Reserve and the 

FDIC have identified substantial shortcomings in many of the plans submitted to date.  In the 

next round of submissions, due this summer, these firms will need to produce plans that show 

they could be resolved in bankruptcy in an orderly fashion.  Meeting this requirement will entail 

significant changes in some combination of corporate structure, inter-corporate relationships, the 

mix and extent of activities, and the legal locus of certain bank activities.

Developing a New Form of Market Regulation    

As I have just described, measures to promote the macroprudential objectives associated 

with the regulation of large financial institutions have already been developed.  They need 

variously to be finalized or implemented.  And all will probably need to be adjusted as time 

passes and circumstances change.  But the tools themselves have been identified, selected, and 

elaborated upon.  When it comes to much financial activity taking place outside prudentially 

regulated institutions, however, there is still a need to develop, analyze, and consider tools that 

should be used for achieving macroprudential aims.   

Given the breadth and diversity of activities that can be encompassed, for example, in the 

term “shadow banking,” it is also necessary for policymakers to identify some priority areas 

within which to focus work on developing an appropriate set of regulations informed by 

macroprudential considerations.  I would suggest that priority should be given to activities that 

pose significant risks of rapid investor flight during stress periods, with the attendant risks of 

firesales and other negative effects on funding and asset markets more generally.  Specifically, it 

seems sensible to prioritize two areas: short-term wholesale funding and the liquidity and 

redemption risks that may be present in asset management activities.  These areas may, of 

course, overlap in some circumstances.   

I have on past occasions described at some length my concerns with short-term wholesale 

funding--especially, though not exclusively, funding associated with assets thought to be cash 

equivalents.5  We are, of course, addressing these risks within prudentially regulated firms 

through various types of liquidity regulation and supervision, as well as changes in practice by 

5 See Daniel K. Tarullo (2013), “Shadow Banking and Systemic Risk Regulation,” speech delivered at the

the firms that clear tri-party repo transactions.  But, as demonstrated in the years preceding the 

crisis, short-term wholesale funding can support a form of shadow banking outside the regulatory 

perimeter.  Indeed, one might expect that as regulatory and supervisory practice forces the 

internalization by regulated firms of the systemic costs of excessive dependence on runnable 

short-term funding, there will be increasing incentives for more leveraged credit intermediation 

to migrate outside the regulatory perimeter.   

One policy response that the Federal Reserve has advocated and that has now been 

proposed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB), is for minimum margins to be required for 

certain forms of securities financing transactions (SFTs) that involve extensions of credit to 

parties that are not prudentially regulated financial institutions.6  This system of margins is 

intended to serve the macroprudential aim of moderating the build-up of leverage in the use of 

these securities in less regulated parts of the financial system and to mitigate the risk of 

procyclical margin calls by preventing their decline to unsustainable levels during credit booms.   

Given the ease with which such transactions may move across borders, it is particularly 

important that the FSB has proposed a framework that could be applicable in all major financial 

markets.  We will welcome comments on this proposal when, as I expect, the Federal Reserve 

issues a notice of proposed rulemaking to implement it domestically, probably by using the 

Federal Reserve’s authority under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to supplement our 

prudential regulatory authorities.  But it is also important to continue analysis of other 

macroprudential policy options that would address the risks associated with short-term wholesale

funding.  Indeed, even the FSB proposal does not extend to SFTs backed by government 

collateral, a very important source of short-term wholesale funds. 

Asset management activities have commanded considerable attention lately, both 

internationally at the FSB and domestically at the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  

The asset management industry has grown rapidly since the financial crisis, both in terms of the 

dollar amount of assets under management and in the concentration of assets managed by the 

largest firms.  These trends may well continue as stricter prudential regulation makes investment 

in certain forms of assets more costly for banks.  To the extent that asset management vehicles 

hold relatively less liquid assets but provide investors the right to redeem their interests on short 

notice, there is a risk that in periods of stress, investor redemptions could exhaust available 

liquidity.  Under some circumstances, a fund might respond by rapidly selling assets, with 

resulting contagion effects on other holders of similar assets and, to the degree they had not 

already been subject to redemption pressures, other asset management vehicles holding those 

assets.  The use of leverage by investment funds, including through derivatives transactions, 

could create interconnectedness risks between funds and key market intermediaries and amplify 

the risk of such firesales. 

 Considerable work is needed, first, to develop better data on assets under management, 

liquidity, and leverage, in order to fill the information gaps that have concerned so many 

academics and policy analysts.  Then there is more work to be done in assessing the magnitude 

of liquidity and redemption risks, including the degree to which those risks vary with the type of 

assets and fund structure.  And finally, we will need tools that will be efficient and effective 

responses to the risks identified. 

11 
 


Both the short-term wholesale funding and asset management examples point to the 

broader objective for macroprudential policy of developing what we might term “prudential 

market regulation”--that is, a policy framework that builds on the traditional investor protection 

and market functioning aims of securities regulation by incorporating a system-wide perspective.  

Like the reforms to banking regulation that followed the crisis, this new form of regulation might 

start by strengthening some of the firm- or fund-specific measures associated with those 

traditional regulatory aims, but then move forward to take into account such considerations as 

system-wide demands on liquidity during stress periods and correlated risks among asset 

managers that could exacerbate liquidity, redemption, and firesale pressures.  The specific 

policies associated with prudential market regulation might be transaction-specific, or apply to 

certain kinds of business models.  In her important speech last month, Securities and Exchange 

Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Jo White provided a roadmap for beginning to develop just such 

a regulatory approach for the asset management industry.7 

In thinking about short-term wholesale funding and some forms of asset management, we 

encounter a background circumstance that complicates the task of developing effective 

macroprudential tools.  Demand for safe short-term assets is both real and substantial, emanating 

from multiple sources, including sovereign nations that wish to self-insure against exchange rate 

pressures; non-financial corporations that have increased their cash holdings in the wake of the 

market disruptions associated with defaults by Enron and other companies; and institutional 

investors protecting themselves against redemption demands or other unexpected cash needs.  

While it is important to adopt measures that protect against runs and that counteract the illusion

Industry,” speech delivered at the New York Times DealBook Opportunities for Tomorrow Conference, New York,

that cash equivalents are actually cash, it is equally important to realize that the demand for 

relatively safe, short-term assets will not disappear.  Indeed, there is some risk that, as regulation 

makes some forms of such assets more costly, this demand will simply turn elsewhere.  Thus the 

ultimate effectiveness of what I have termed prudential market regulation will depend on 

policymakers taking into account in their regulatory approaches the sources of, and motivation 

for, demand for short-term, liquid, and relatively safe assets beyond the debt of very 

creditworthy sovereigns. 

Central Counterparties   

My third policy objective with a macroprudential component relates to central 

counterparties (CCPs).  A key regulatory aim following the crisis, both in the United States and 

internationally, has been to encourage more derivatives and other financial transactions to be 

cleared through CCPs.  There are important financial stability benefits to be gained from the 

progress that has been made toward this aim--including multilateral netting, standardized initial 

and variation margin requirements, and greater transparency.   

However, as has been frequently observed, if the financial system is to reap these 

benefits, the central counterparties to which transactions are moving must themselves be sound 

and stable.  Extreme but plausible events, such as the failure of clearing members or a rapid 

change in the value of instruments traded by a CCP, could expose it to financial distress.  If the 

CCP has insufficient resources to deal with such stress, it may look to its clearing members to 

provide support.  But if the problems arise during a period of generalized financial stress, the 

clearing members may themselves already have been weakened or, even if they remain sound, 

the diversion of their available liquidity to the CCP may prevent customers of the clearing 

members from accessing needed funding.  If the CCP fails, the adverse effects on the financial 

13 
 


system could be significant, including the prospect that the CCP’s default on its obligations 

could amplify the stress on other important financial institutions.8 

 Considerable work to ensure the safety of CCPs has been done--internationally by the 

Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI)9 at the Bank for International 

Settlements and by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO), and 

domestically by the SEC, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and the Federal 

Reserve.  The 2012 CPMI-IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) 

updated and strengthened regulatory standards for, among other financial market utilities, 

significant CCPs.  These principles, once fully implemented by all relevant U.S. agencies, will 

provide a strong and consistent basis for heightened oversight of the CCPs designated as 

systemically important by the FSOC.  These heightened standards must continue to be supported 

by robust supervisory efforts that should continue to evolve as supervisors gain experience 

assessing firms against new regulations and consider new and changing risks faced by CCPs.  

Notwithstanding the advances in CCP regulation, questions have been raised in 

international fora, in discussions among domestic financial and regulatory officials, and by some 

market participants over whether more needs to be done.  To me, at least, some of the most 

important questions implicate macroprudential concerns.  One discrete example is the possibility 

that CCP margining practices may have a significantly procyclical character that could be 

problematic in deteriorating financial conditions.   

More fundamentally, systemically important CCPs are now generally required to have 

funds sufficient to cover defaults by their two largest members (“cover 2”).  Perhaps this is the

Powell (2014), “A Financial System Perspective on Central Clearing of Derivatives,” speech at the 17th Annual 
International Banking Conference, Chicago, November 6.

right standard when contemplating the well-being of a CCP in isolation.  But it seems worth 

considering whether this standard is adequate when hypothesizing stress throughout the financial 

system, since the default of two large counterparties would almost surely be accompanied by 

significant market disruption.  At the least, it is important to ensure a consistent, robust 

implementation of the cover 2 standard that has already been agreed. 

While the question of what constitutes the optimal default fund standard needs more 

analysis and debate, I think there is little question that more attention must be paid to 

strengthening stress testing, recovery strategies, and resolution plans for significant CCPs.  The 

typical CCP recovery strategy does not take a system-wide perspective and is premised on 

imposing losses on, or drawing liquidity from, CCP members during what may be a period of 

systemic stress.  Many of these members are themselves systemically important firms, which 

will likely be suffering losses and facing liquidity demands of their own in anything but an 

idiosyncratic stress scenario at a CCP.  Moreover, in at least some cases, uncertainty is increased 

by the difficulty of estimating with any precision the extent of potential liability of members to 

the CCP, thereby complicating both their recovery planning and efforts by the official sector to 

assess system-wide capital and liquidity availability in adverse scenarios.  

These and other questions will be discussed in the coming months at the CPMI, the FSB, 

and other international fora, as well as among U.S. regulators.  Researchers with a 

macroprudential perspective can contribute to these discussions with analyses of system-wide 

liquidity demands and knock-on effects of defaults by CCP members, as well as policy 

suggestions to address vulnerabilities that emerge from these analyses. 

15 
 


Conclusion 

In a basic sense, the imperative of a macroprudential policy perspective means taking 

account of system-wide effects as financial regulation is developed and implemented.  But as is 

the case with traditional microprudential policy, agreement at this high level does not necessarily 

assure agreement on the priorities for regulatory attention, much less the specific regulations that 

should be adopted.  Nor can even the best-conceived macroprudential policies compensate 

totally for the risks created by key macroeconomic or financial conditions.  It should, however, 

force us all to think about issues like arbitrage, correlated risks and responses, and externalities 

in a more explicit and regular fashion than was evident in pre-crisis practice.  And even as 

policymakers try to move forward with a practical agenda to incorporate macroprudential 

concerns in their programs, it is important that the academics and policy researchers represented 

by this audience continue to advance this still fledgling sub-discipline through both theoretical 

and empirical work.
