Legal Opportunities and Challenges in Crafting a Foreclosure Response 




Remarks by 


Sarah Bloom Raskin 


Member 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


Maryland State Bar Association Advanced Real Property Institute 


Columbia, Maryland 








October 4, 2011 





Good morning.  It’s a great pleasure to be with you, and I want to thank the Real 

Property section for inviting me to speak at the Advanced Real Property Institute.  I have 

been immersed at the Federal Reserve in economic analysis, but my first professional 

language is the law, so it’s a special treat to be before this audience of lawyers today 

where I can speak in my native tongue.  I’m also excited to be with you this morning 

because I began my time as commissioner of financial regulation for the state of 

Maryland in the heat of the financial crisis, and I am keenly aware that Maryland’s 

lawyers came together in a show of massive pro bono strength to help homeowners 

confronting unprecedented numbers of foreclosures in the state.  I want to recognize the 

impressive, timely, and trend-setting work that was performed during the foreclosure 

crisis here in Maryland.  This work continues in various ways, including most recently 

the announcement that the state of Maryland will be participating in the launch of HOPE 

Loan Port, the country’s first web-based foreclosure mediation portal.  Lawyers in 

Maryland consistently have been on the forefront in supporting mediation systems to 

resolve issues between homeowners and servicers. 

During my first week as a Federal Reserve governor, the set of mortgage 

servicing problems and inequities related to robo-signing hit the national news.  While 

many were surprised by the news, this is something that we had been dealing with here in 

Maryland more than three years ago; as many of you know from having worked on these 

issues, we had identified serious servicing problems as early as 2008 in Maryland, had 

analyzed them quite extensively, and had crafted some effective legal, administrative, and 

legislative early responses.  Being rather dismayed that the federal folks believed this to 

be a new problem, and concerned that problems with servicing nationwide would hinder

the revival of the housing market and our recovery from recession, I gave a speech 

advocating a series of measures at the national and state levels to contain the damage to 

homeowners in November 2010.  To my dismay, here we are in 2011, with a recovery 

that is still being dragged down by serious housing problems that will require not just 

economic talent--but, significantly, legal talent--to address.  

 I want to talk this morning about a couple of those legal challenges.  Of course, 

these remarks are intended to express my own views, and they do not necessarily reflect 

the opinions of my colleagues on the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market 

Committee. 

Housing Market Conditions 

Six years after house prices first began to fall, we are still dealing with the 

aftermath of the housing bubble.  Nationally, house prices have fallen by nearly one-third 

since their peak in the first quarter of 2006, and total homeowners’ equity in the United 

States has shrunk by more than one-half--a loss of more than $7 trillion.  This is a 

shocking and enormous decline. 

The drop in house prices has had far-reaching effects on families and the 

economy, in part because so many American families--nearly 70 percent--own their 

homes.

  In contrast, only about one-half of American families hold any stocks, either 

directly or through accounts such as Individual Retirement Accounts, 401(k)s, or mutual 

funds.
2
  The fall in house prices has caused families to cut back on their spending and has 

prevented families from using their home equity to fund education expenses or start small

businesses.  An estimated 3 million families are not able to refinance their mortgages at 

today’s historically low interest rates because they are underwater on their mortgages.

And many borrowers have lost their homes to foreclosure:  More than 4 percent of all 

mortgages in the United States were in foreclosure, and an additional 3 percent or so were 

delinquent by 90 days or more in the second quarter of this year.  Initially, when I was 

commissioner of financial regulation, foreclosures were concentrated among borrowers 

with subprime mortgages.  But today, because of the magnitude of the economic 

downturn and the high level of unemployment, the typical borrower in foreclosure has a 

prime or Federal Housing Administration mortgage. 

As all of you know, the drop in house prices has put considerable pressure on the 

legal system.  Of course, the huge wave of foreclosures has strained and sometimes 

overwhelmed the courts, particularly in states with judicial foreclosure processes.  But in 

a deeper sense, the standard contracts that govern mortgage lending, servicing, and 

securitization did not account for a potential collapse of this magnitude in the housing 

sector.  As the bubble expanded, securitization contracts did not provide enough incentive 

to discourage shoddy underwriting practices.  In the aftermath, the inadequacies of 

servicing contracts have contributed to the agonizingly slow pace of mortgage 

modifications and repeated breakdowns in the foreclosure process. 

Prior to the crisis, the nation’s mortgage finance system developed into an 

extensive set of specialized industry players with a complex set of linkages operating not 

just at the lender and borrower level, but also with an extensive secondary market that 

was intended to diffuse risk.  All of these relationships were governed by contracts.  The

promissory note, for example, lays out the terms under which the borrower will repay the 

loan, while the mortgage reflects the lender’s security interest in the property.  But there 

are also contracts between the borrower and third parties and between the lender and third 

parties.  For example, the borrower likely will enter agreements for title, flood, or private 

mortgage insurance, while the lender may enter an agreement with another institution to 

service the loan.  Add mortgage securitization to the mix, and the number of contractual 

relationships snowballs.  For a private-label securitization, a crucial contract is the 

pooling and servicing agreement, or PSA, which specifies matters such as the 

characteristics of the mortgages in the pool, how these mortgages will be serviced, and 

how the money generated from the loans will be distributed to investors.  At nearly every 

linkage of our mortgage finance system there is a contractual relationship, and at nearly 

every contractual linkage there has been legal challenge and litigation.   

For example, let’s just zero in on one such contractual relationship and examine 

how the legal structure set forth in this relationship has held up.  First, let’s look at the 

provisions that govern mortgage servicing, and second, the provisions that lay out the 

representations and warranties about the features and underwriting quality of the loans 

included in the securitization.  Both sets of provisions exist in the contract that governs 

the securitization, the PSA.  

Mortgage Servicing 

The problems in mortgage servicing have been well documented.  For example,  

the federal banking regulators found significant problems when we looked at mortgage 

servicing and foreclosure processing at 14 federally regulated mortgage servicers, which 

collectively represent more than two-thirds of all servicing volume nationally.  These 


 - 5 - 

problems include critical weaknesses in servicers’ foreclosure governance processes, 

foreclosure document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party 

law firms and other vendors.  These problems indicate the existence of unsafe and 

unsound banking practices and violations of federal and state laws, as well as 

demonstrated patterns of misconduct and negligence on the part of servicers.  Individual 

consumers have been harmed by this negligence, including the negligence of law firms.  

In addition, the imperative for servicers to fix their systems, review past decisions, and 

put in place the internal systems and controls that they should have had all along has 

impeded the repair of the overall housing market. 

The burden of addressing these issues of repair, review, and implementation of 

systems and controls rests with the mortgage servicers, their parent financial institutions, 

and the law firms that mishandled the foreclosures.  But what do the terms of the PSA, 

which is the standard contract governing this work, require in this context?  The standard 

servicing contract provides disincentives for servicers to act in the best interests of 

investors and borrowers.  This misalignment of incentives has more profound 

consequences when defaults are high. 

Under the standard contract, servicers receive a flat fee per loan that they service, 

usually 1/4 to 1/2 percent of the unpaid loan balance annually, depending on the type of 

loan.  The flat fee is considerably more than is required to service a performing loan and 

considerably less than is required to service a delinquent loan.  The expectation is that, on 

average, the fee will cover the servicer’s expenses.  Servicers are also reimbursed for 

some expenses, such as the cost of a title search when pursuing a foreclosure, but 

generally not for unanticipated overhead or labor costs. 


 - 6 - 

The PSA aligns the incentives of borrowers, servicers, and investors reasonably 

well when mortgage defaults are low.  Under normal circumstances, mortgage servicing 

is profitable.  A servicer primarily processes mortgage payments and minimizes labor and 

overhead costs by harnessing economies of scale and automating the process as much as 

possible. 

The PSA does not perform nearly as well under stressed circumstances.  When 

mortgage delinquencies are high, mortgage servicing is not profitable, and servicers may 

feel extra pressure to cut costs as much as possible.  In addition, servicers may not be 

properly motivated to perform loan modifications even when such modifications are in 

the best interests of borrowers and investors.  Servicer compensation is not generally tied 

to the performance of the loan, and in most cases a servicer receives no extra payment for 

preventing a default.  Further, loan modifications are labor intensive, and this extra labor 

cost is not reimbursed under the contract.  Instead, the PSA provides for the 

reimbursement of some foreclosure expenses. 

Other language in the contract also does little to encourage loan modifications, 

particularly in the case of securitized mortgages.  Many PSAs provide minimal guidance 

about modifications beyond specifying that servicers should apply “usual and normal” 

servicing standards or the same standards that they apply to the loans held in portfolio.  

With such vague guidance, servicers assert that they are worried about litigation risk if 

they employ servicing approaches that have not been widely adopted throughout the 

industry.  Furthermore, even when the PSAs provide guidance about loan modifications, 

it can differ widely across PSAs, often preventing servicers from designing a uniform 

modification program for their entire portfolio. 


 - 7 - 

To borrow from the title of a popular marital advice column, Can this contract be 

saved?  I think the answer is no--at least not in its current form.  This contract might have 

been adequate if servicers had followed the age-old advice and used their profits from the 

fat years when defaults were low in order to build their capacity for lean years when 

defaults were high.  But in practice, this does not appear to have happened--and perhaps 

even the most knowing servicer a few years ago might not have anticipated the 

subsequent level of mortgage defaults. 

Given that failure, it is imperative to reconsider the compensation structure so that 

servicers have adequate incentives to perform payment processing efficiently on 

performing mortgages, and to perform effective loss mitigation on delinquent loans.  

After the compensation structure is reconsidered, the PSAs need to be amended or 

renegotiated in order to facilitate more workouts.  Finally, PSAs should clarify the 

situations in which loan modifications and other mitigation strategies should be pursued.  

One tool that could aid in providing such clarity, and has received substantial attention 

over the last few years, is the net present value model.  Requiring servicers to take 

mitigative actions that are net-present-value positive to the investor could encourage the 

fair and consistent treatment of borrowers.   

 Investors also need tools that will allow them to better monitor servicer 

performance and take action accordingly.  These tools should be developed and described 

in the contract.  Currently, metrics that allow investors to measure servicers’ execution 

are not widely available.  Such metrics could include customer satisfaction ratings, 

delinquency and cure rates, the average time that a homeowner waits on the phone to talk 

with the servicer, and servicer error rates.  Indeed, one can even imagine the development 


 - 8 - 

of a uniform servicer scorecard.  To be meaningful, the ability to transfer servicing from 

low-performing servicers to high-performing ones would have to be enhanced.  The 

creation of common back-office systems across servicers would make transfer less prone 

to error and less costly, and any contractual or legal barriers would need to be reduced to 

allow investors to “fire” a low-performing servicer.  A new contractual regime designed 

along these lines would represent a significant change from the existing world of 

servicing, but it could help create a system in which servicers compete on the quality of 

their performance and are more accountable to both investors and consumers. 

Representations and Warranties 

I turn next to the problem of representations and warranties contained in the 

PSAs.  Underwriting standards declined dramatically in the middle part of the previous 

decade as the housing bubble approached its peak.  For example, the median combined 

loan-to-value ratio on subprime mortgages originated for home purchases rose from 

90 percent in 2003 to 100 percent in 2005--meaning that more than one-half of borrowers 

who purchased homes with subprime mortgages put no money down.  The share of 

mortgages in which borrowers did not document fully their income or assets also 

increased.  In addition, the number of mortgages that defaulted in the first year after 

origination--commonly considered a gauge of poor underwriting--rose appreciably as the 

bubble approached its peak.

The “originate to distribute” model of loan origination may have contributed to 

this decline in underwriting standards.  Under this model, brokers or lenders sell the loan 

to a third party, typically a securitizer, who then issues securities collateralized by

mortgage loans to investors.  This model technically describes securities guaranteed by 

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as well as private-label securities sponsored by financial 

institutions such as commercial or investment banks, but problems were more acute in the 

private-label market. 

Although the private-label originate-to-distribute model may have worked 

adequately at first, this discipline eroded as the securitization boom progressed.  

Originators and securitizers were generally able to complete securitization transactions 

while retaining very little or no economic stake in the performance of the loan after the 

sale, although some of these securities did ultimately make their way back onto the 

balance sheets of certain financial conglomerates, much to their dismay.  As a result, 

originators and securitizers had an increasing incentive to weaken underwriting standards 

in order to increase the volume of loan origination, and thereby the volume of 

securitizations. 

As securitization developed and became more prominent as a source of financing 

for mortgage lending, representations and warranties were one of the main tools market 

participants relied on to align incentives among originators and securitizers on the one 

hand and investors on the other.  These provisions describe the underwriting standards 

and other matters with respect to the assets that are the subject of the securitization.  The 

originator, in principle, is required to refund at par (less payments received) the value of 

the loan should it violate the originator’s representations and warranties or in some cases, 

should it default within a specified time from origination.  In practice, however, 

representations and warranties did not function as intended. 


 - 10 - 

First, as in the case of servicing, contracts in private-label mortgage 

securitizations varied considerably from deal to deal, and there was no consistent 

language or standard for representations and warranties.  Therefore, a poorly 

underwritten mortgage loan could breach the representations and warranties of one deal’s 

contract but not be a violation of representations and warranties in another very similar 

deal; this discrepancy would only be apparent following a careful reading and nuanced 

comparison of the differences in drafting between the two contracts.  Given the volume 

of transactions investors were considering, it is not surprising that they may not have 

conducted a thorough analysis of the different risks each set of representations and 

warranties presented.  Second, the lack of standardization of representations and 

warranties gives rise to greater opportunity for parties in a failed securitization 

transaction to argue over the interpretation of contract terms, increasing legal uncertainty 

and making effective resolution of investor claims more difficult.  Finally, in order to 

enforce their representations and warranties, investors may need to band together in 

groups representing 25 percent or more of the voting rights in order to make certain 

demands upon the securitization trustee.  Investors may be dispersed and have difficulty 

coordinating their actions. 

The flaws in the representations and warranties provisions of the PSAs appear to 

be widely recognized.  For example, many key players in the securitization industry have 

worked through Project RESTART, an initiative of the American Securitization Forum 

(ASF), to create an industry standard for representations and warranties that covers 

prudent practices and is commonly understood by all market participants.

also published model principles for repurchasing mortgage loans that breach 

representation warranties to provide a standard industry PSA enforcement mechanism.

  I 

believe that these are useful developments and should promote greater consistency in 

governing contracts of mortgage securitizations in the future, thereby facilitating investor 

monitoring of underwriting standards and setting common expectations for resolution of 

breaches of representations and warranties when they occur. 

Nevertheless, standard representations and warranties, no matter how well 

drafted, are unlikely on their own, or even in combination with a well-constructed 

enforcement standard, to go far enough to resolve the crucial problems of misaligned 

incentives and disparities in access to information in the securitization process.  During 

lending and asset booms, there is a temptation for market participants to collectively 

allow underwriting standards to weaken in order to meet a market demand for increased 

lending.  When a crisis then occurs, bankruptcies of originators and securitizers of 

mortgages may prevent investors in practice from obtaining restitution for breaches of 

representations and warranties.   

Thus, other contractual mechanisms are also required to promote a healthy and 

properly aligned securitization market.  For instance, comprehensive disclosures about 

the mortgage loans being securitized are vital to ensure that investors are able to conduct 

meaningful due diligence prior to making a decision to invest in a securitization.  They 

are also vital to investors’ ongoing monitoring of the servicing and administration of 

securitization transactions.  The work of the Securities and Exchange Commission to

Conclusion 

The period since the onset of the financial crisis has been described as one of the 

worst economic episodes since the Great Depression, which was another time of 

tremendous strain on the housing market.  House prices declined about 30 percent from 

peak to trough, and the homeownership rate, as recorded by the decennial census, fell 

from 48 percent in 1930 to 44 percent in 1940.  Nonfarm mortgage foreclosures reached a 

thousand per day in 1933, and, in fact, foreclosures were so widespread that 28 states 

imposed foreclosure moratoriums.  Mortgage lending was disrupted, and private 

mortgage insurance companies and private mortgage securitization collapsed. 

One factor in the upheaval in mortgage lending was the mortgage contract.  

Before the Great Depression, the long-term fully amortized contract had not yet been 

widely adopted.  Instead, one common contract featured a short maturity, generally five 

years or less, and often did not call for any regular payments on the principal.  A 

borrower was likely to default at the end of the loan term if he was not able to roll over 

the loan or obtain a new loan to pay off the existing balance.  This contract also made it 

difficult to assess the health of financial institutions, as lenders booked the loans as

 See Disclosure of Asset-Backed Securities Required by Section 943 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 4489 (Jan. 26, 2011) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pts. 

229, 232, 240, and 249).  In addition, the risk retention requirements of section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall 

Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act are also important to a comprehensive effort to align 

incentives in the securitization markets in order to promote sound underwriting.  By requiring securitizers 

to retain a share of the economic risk in the mortgages they securitize from the outset of the transaction, the 

requirement creates incentives for securitizers to better monitor the credit quality of assets they securitize 

and ultimately discourages unsafe and unsound underwriting practices by originators.

short-term exposures when the risk was actually much longer term.  One contemporary 

source called the contract “a menace.”
8
 

After the Great Depression, fully amortizing loans with maturities of 15 years or 

longer became the standard.  Federal policy appears to have been a key factor in this 

transition.  First, the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation--a sort of precursor to today’s 

Making Home Affordable program--purchased distressed mortgages and modified them 

into loans that amortized for 15 years or longer.
9
  Second, the newly created Federal 

Housing Administration sold insurance on 20-year fully amortizing loans.  Third, savings 

and loans with new federal charters were required to make fully amortizing loans except 

when state law forbade it. 

The challenge for us today, as I see it, is to emulate our predecessors from the 

1930s who dealt with a comparable crisis.  We need to consider our current array of 

mortgage contracts with a dispassionate eye and open mind.  If the contracts today are not 

working--and the evidence seems clear to me that, along some dimensions, they are not--

we as lawyers should be working on ways to improve them.  Without such improvements 

you may not be serving your clients, and from the perspective of the macroeconomy, 

none of us will be contributing to a reconstruction of the legal framework in the crucial 

context of mortgage finance.  Lawyers have a singular responsibility and exceptional 

ability to help rebuild this framework, and I urge you to consider how you can contribute 

to the effort of renegotiating these relationships and how the terms of such a renegotiation 

might become memorialized in contracts.  This is a massive challenge for lawyers who

practice in the field of mortgage finance and your country needs you to tackle it with the 

same vigor and energy that you have brought to other legal challenges in this housing 

crisis.  

Cicero said that “the safety of the people should be the highest law.”  Our people 

will not be financially safe until we re-examine and re-set the terms that define 

relationships in the housing market.  So we have a serious challenge ahead of us.  It’s a 

challenge that I have confidence we can meet with your help. 

Thank you, and I’m happy to take your questions and hear your comments.
