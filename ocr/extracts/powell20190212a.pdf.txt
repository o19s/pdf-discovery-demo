Thank you for that kind introduction.  I also want to thank Hope Enterprise 

Corporation for inviting me to speak and Mississippi Valley State University (MVSU) for 

hosting us on its lovely campus.   

It is a great pleasure to visit the Mississippi Delta.  This region gave America the 

priceless musical heritage of the Blues.  It was also the site of some of the watershed 

events of the civil rights movement.  But the Delta, like many rural areas, has long 

confronted the challenge of poverty.  Today I’ll speak about three areas of opportunity 

for addressing the challenges of rural poverty--education and workforce development, 

entrepreneurship and small business development, as well as access to financial services--

the topic of this conference. 

MVSU’s mission, providing young people an affordable college education, is 

itself a very powerful antipoverty program--for its graduates, of course, but also for other 

communities that are touched by the university.  MVSU opened its doors in 1950 as 

Mississippi Vocational College.  The vocation of every member of its first class of 200 

students was teaching.  And even as it added other programs and became a full-fledged 

university, MVSU has continued to train many of the teachers who enrich, inspire, and 

spark the imagination of children who grow up in the Delta.   

MVSU and other historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, play a 

crucial role in their communities.  For much of the 20th century, HBCUs were the 

primary means for black men and women to obtain the education needed for middle class 

or professional jobs.  Larger percentages of HBCU students, compared with students at 

predominantly white institutions, come from lower-income families and are the first in 

their families to attend college.  This university and other HBCUs support intellectual

leadership, creativity, and innovation.  I want to honor you for this proud history and for 

your continuing commitment to a better future for your students and for the region where 

many of your students were born and will build their lives and raise their families.1 

Challenges and Opportunities in Poor Rural Communities 

Today, data at the national level show a strong economy.  Unemployment is near 

a half-century low, and economic output is growing at a solid pace.  But we know that 

prosperity has not been felt as much in some areas, including many rural places.  The 

Federal Reserve can help by carrying out our monetary policy mission of supporting 

maximum employment and price stability.  We also support strong communities by 

conducting research, promoting community development, and enforcing laws like the 

Community Reinvestment Act, which helps ensure that people have adequate access to 

financial services wherever they live.  We not only work with communities, we are in 

communities, through the presence of our 12 regional Reserve Banks. 

Poverty remains a challenge in many rural communities.  Indeed, 70 percent of 

the 473 “persistent poverty” counties in the United States are rural.2  Unemployment and 

mortality rates remain high in these communities.  Along with lower incomes and wealth, 

the rate of business start-ups in these areas is lower.  And their residents have less access

to financial services.  Many of these disparities have existed for generations, and in some 

places have roots in a history of discrimination. 

These areas also generally lack diverse industries and employment options and 

often have suffered from a decline in a traditional industry.  In Appalachia for instance, 

timber, coal mining, tobacco, and textiles have long been in decline.3  Likewise, the 

number of jobs in agriculture and low-skilled manufacturing, mainstays of the Delta’s 

economy, is decreasing as a result of automation and outsourcing.4 

Education and Workforce Development 

High-quality education and training play a crucial role in extending opportunity in 

rural areas, starting with early childhood education.5  But in many rural communities, 

access to high-quality preschool education is limited.  Mississippi is one of several 

mostly rural states where nearly half of residents lack access to good quality childcare, 

which is the main source of early childhood education.6  Many decades of research also

confirm that children who grow up in areas with better-quality K-12 schools or in classes 

with higher-quality teachers have better outcomes in life.7 

Later in life, workforce training and education are most effective when they train 

workers in skills needed by local employers.  Rural areas where traditional industries are 

declining and where new employers may be moving in often experience a mismatch 

between the skills of local workers and those demanded by the new employers.  Training 

and retraining programs tend to be centralized and concentrated in areas with a higher 

population density, which puts many rural areas at a disadvantage.8  

Education benefits both the student and the community.  It is true that some 

young people leave their hometowns to seek greater opportunity.  However, it is also true 

that young families, drawn back home by family and social ties, are the largest source of 

in-migration in many rural communities.  Young families are more likely to come if they 

believe their children will get a good education.  Returnees often bring back important 

skills and experiences and make meaningful contributions to the local economy.9 

An excellent example is Tim Lampkin, an MVSU graduate.  Tim grew up and 

graduated from high school in Clarksdale.  After graduating from MVSU, he moved to

Mobile for work.  He wasn’t gone long, though, before he felt called to return to make his 

home here in the Delta.  Since moving back, Tim has founded several businesses, as well 

as a nonprofit that helps people of color start and grow their own businesses. 

Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development 

As with Tim and his clients, entrepreneurship opportunities can motivate residents 

who have left rural communities to return home--or to keep them from moving away in 

the first place.  Business ownership represents an important source of income and wealth 

for both owners and their employees.  Recognizing this fact, successful communities find 

ways to help residents turn what they know and do best, including skills they may have 

gained from industries in decline, into profitable small businesses.10  One example of a 

community taking this approach is Clarksdale, Mississippi. 

About 10 years ago, civic and business leaders assessed what made Clarksdale 

special and how those characteristics could help the community thrive.  Since Clarksdale 

calls itself “Home of the Blues,” attracting tourists using the local Blues culture seemed 

promising.  Over the years, Clarksdale has created new jobs by investing to improve its 

downtown, and has supported local businesses that cater to tourists interested in the 

community’s musical heritage. 

This growth is also creating new businesses not directly related to tourism--

businesses such as Urgent and Primary Care of Clarksdale.  Dr. Mary Williams opened 

her urgent care facility last spring, partly in response to the closure of nearby Quitman 

                                                 
10 Such support systems generally include consistent and easily accessible ways for potential business 
owners to find the advice, financing, and education they need to be successful.  See Federal Reserve Bank 
of Kansas City (2015), Grow Your Own:  Entrepreneurship-Based Economic Development for Local 
Communities (Kansas City, Mo.:  FRB Kansas City),

County Hospital.  Dr. Williams worked with local organizations to develop a business 

plan and obtain the financing needed to open a business that is critical to the community.  

DeWitt, Arkansas, is another rural community where entrepreneurship is sparking 

a local revival.  DeWitt is a town of about 3,000 people.  Like Itta Bena and many small 

towns, it has seen a steady decline in population over the past few decades.  The economy 

there is a mix of manufacturing and agriculture, and many families have farmed the land 

for generations, such as the family of Tami and Troy Hornbeck. 

The Hornbecks grew up in DeWitt, starting and eventually selling a successful 

business built on a new soybean varietal that grows well in the South.  More recently, 

they have been helping lead a new industry in their community using waste vegetable oil 

from local restaurants and oil pressed from camelina, a crop farmers are beginning to 

grow locally.  This cooperative effort involves a partnership between a community 

college, a university, the local government, farmers and restaurants, and a Community 

Development Financial Institution, or CDFI, among others.11  While still in the early 

stages, it has led to the creation of several new businesses and imbued the town with a 

new sense of what is possible. 

Entrepreneurs such as the Hornbecks and Dr. Williams need support to succeed, 

the kind of support HBCUs and other institutions of higher education have long provided.  

MVSU itself is supporting rural minority entrepreneurs through its participation in the 

HBCU Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Initiative, which teaches students how to start and 

grow a business.   

                                                 
11 CDFI Certification is a designation given by the CDFI Fund of the U.S. Department of the Treasury to 
specialized organizations that provide financial services in low-income communities and to people who 
lack access to financing.  CDFIs include regulated institutions, such as community development banks and 
credit unions, and nonregulated institutions, like loan and venture capital funds.

But inspiring stories like these are not as common as they could be.  

Entrepreneurship has the potential to play a greater role in poor rural areas, particularly in 

areas whose residents are predominantly black and other people of color.  Recent surveys 

have found relatively high levels of interest in owning businesses among young people of 

color.12  Indeed, nationwide, black women represent one of the fastest growing groups of 

entrepreneurs.13  Yet research by the Federal Reserve suggests people of color experience 

greater challenges in gaining access to credit to start or expand businesses, which leads 

me to my last topic and the focus of this forum: access to financial services.14 

Access to Financial Services 

Access to safe and affordable financial services is vital, especially among families 

with limited wealth--whether they are looking to invest in education, start a business, or 

simply manage the ups and downs of life.  Family income and savings represent the 

largest source of funding for students’ education.  However, more than half of students or 

their families also borrow to finance their studies.  And racial wealth disparities make 

black students more likely than white students to borrow for their education.15  Similarly,

racial wealth disparities mean access to credit is critical for would-be entrepreneurs who 

must borrow to supplement personal savings and support from friends and family.  Banks 

often consider credit scores when evaluating loan requests, however, and high-poverty 

regions tend to have a larger percentage of people with no established credit rating or a 

low credit score.  This combination of low wealth and low credit scores limits access to 

credit or causes borrowers to turn to higher-cost credit. 

Fortunately, CDFIs are helping potential borrowers improve their 

creditworthiness and providing them with safe and affordable credit.  While CDFIs fill a 

critical gap in some communities, most consumers use other banks and credit unions.  In 

rural areas, this often means a community bank.16  Industry consolidation has led to a 

long-term decline in the number of community banks.  While most rural communities 

continue to be relatively well served, that is less often the case in communities with high-

poverty rates.17  

In 2018, Federal Reserve staff members met with leaders in rural areas across the 

country that had recently experienced a bank branch closure.  We found that small 

businesses, older people, and people with limited access to transportation are most

affected.18  We also learned that the loss of the branch often meant more than the loss of 

access to financial services; it also meant the loss of financial advice, local civic 

leadership, and an institution that brought needed customers to nearby businesses. 

Regulation and supervision need to be carefully tailored to suit the size and 

business model of different types of institutions.  At the Fed, we have renewed our efforts 

to avoid unnecessary regulatory burden on community banks, which provide essential 

credit in their local communities. 

Another means to address the issue of branch closures is the Community 

Reinvestment Act, or CRA, which encourages banks to help meet the credit needs of the 

communities they are chartered to serve.  The CRA has been an important tool for 

strengthening local communities.  The trend toward fewer branches and increased use of 

technology to deliver financial services presents a particular challenge to our current 

approach to CRA evaluations.  Specifically, the current regulations use a bank’s branches 

to define its assessment area, the area for which it is evaluated for CRA purposes.  To the 

extent that banks serve much broader areas using online or other non-branch delivery 

systems, or have so many assessment areas that examiners cannot do a thorough 

evaluation in each, the financial needs of many rural communities may be overlooked.  

                                                 
18 These findings are broadly consistent with the literature, which identifies adverse effects of branch 
closures for small business borrowers, in particular, as well as for low-income communities.  See, for 
example, Hoai-Luu Q. Nguyen (2014), “Do Bank Branches Still Matter?  The Effect of Closings on Local 
Economic Outcomes,” Massachusetts Institute of Technology Working Paper (Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT, 
December), http://economics.mit.edu/files/10143; and O. Emre Ergungor (2006), “Bank Branch Presence 
and Access to Credit in Low-to-Moderate Income Neighborhoods,” Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland 
Working Paper 06-16 (Cleveland, Ohio:  FRB Cleveland, December),

archives/2006-working-papers/wp-0616-bank-branch-presence-and-access-to-credit.aspx.

We believe that revisions to the CRA’s implementing regulations should more effectively 

encourage banks to seek opportunities in underserved areas.19 

Conclusion 

To summarize my main points today, people in rural communities who are 

struggling with persistent poverty need access to high-quality education from preschool 

through college.  They need support for their aspirations to own their own businesses.  

And they need access to safe and affordable credit.   

I will conclude where I began, by applauding both MVSU and Hope for their 

long-standing contribution toward bettering the lives of the people of Itta Bena and 

similar rural communities.
