 Good Morning.  On behalf of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 

System, I’d like to welcome everyone to the last of our series of public hearings held to 

discuss changes to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).  The knowledge and 

feedback we have gained from these hearings will help us to assess the adequacy of 

current mortgage data, examine the need for additional data, and explore possible 

changes to Regulation C, which implements HMDA.  I’d like to thank our colleagues at 

the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta, San Francisco, and Chicago for hosting the first 

three hearings. 

 Our series of hearings kicked off just as Congress passed regulatory reform 

legislation earlier this summer.  The Dodd-Frank Act provides for some changes to 

HMDA data collection and submission, and we look forward to hearing from our 

panelists and members of the public about the implementation of these changes.  The new 

law also transfers authority for HMDA rulemaking from the Board of Governors to the 

new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  All information gleaned from these 

hearings will inform our own work for the time that we continue to have rulewriting 

authority.  When that authority transfers to the CFPB, be assured that we will hand over 

the most current thinking about changes to Regulation C. 

 Over the course of these hearings, we have heard from key players in the home 

mortgage market:  lenders and other market participants, academics and researchers, 

consumer advocacy and community development organizations, data experts, regulators, 

and other public officials.  Although they play different roles, we believe that all share a 

common goal:  To ensure that the mortgage market is responsible, transparent, efficient, 

and serves the needs of consumers and market participants alike.

 Clearly, the recent mortgage crisis has highlighted the potential ramifications of a 

mortgage market that is not functioning well.  HMDA data do not create the market or 

solve all market problems, but they do help us understand what is happening in the 

market.  The time is certainly ripe for reviewing and revising the data elements, 

standards, and reporting formats.   

 HMDA has three purposes.  One is to provide the public and government officials 

with data that will help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of the 

neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.  A second is to help 

government officials target public investment to promote private investment where it is 

needed.  A third purpose is to provide data to assist in identifying possible discriminatory 

lending patterns and facilitate the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, such as the 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

 Today’s hearing is intended to serve as a venue to discuss whether or not the 2002 

revisions to Regulation C provided useful and accurate information about the mortgage 

market, to gather information that will help assess the need for additional data elements 

or improvements, and to identify emerging issues in the mortgage market that may 

require additional research.  As I said earlier, we are also interested in any comments on 

the implementation of the HMDA elements of the regulatory reform legislation. 

 We have gathered this morning an impressive array of panelists representing a 

broad spectrum of vantage points, and we look forward to their comments.  This input, 

together with the input of the preceding hearings and written comments submitted from 

the public, will be carefully weighed as we consider changes to Regulation C.
