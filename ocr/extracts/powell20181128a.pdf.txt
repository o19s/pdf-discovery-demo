It is a pleasure to be back at the Economic Club of New York.  I will begin by 

briefly reviewing the outlook for the economy, and then turn to a discussion of financial 

stability.  My main subject today will be the profound transformation since the Global 

Financial Crisis in the Federal Reserve’s approach to monitoring and addressing financial 

stability.  Today marks the publication of the Board of Governors’ first Financial 

Stability Report.  Earlier this month, we published our first Supervision and Regulation 

Report.  Together, these reports contain a wealth of information on our approach to 

financial stability and to financial regulation more broadly.  By clearly and transparently 

explaining our policies, we aim to strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy 

that enables the Fed to serve the needs of the American public.   

Outlook and Monetary Policy 

Congress assigned the Federal Reserve the job of promoting maximum 

employment and price stability.  I am pleased to say that our economy is now close to 

both of those objectives.  The unemployment rate is 3.7 percent, a 49-year low, and many 

other measures of labor market strength are at or near historic bests.  Inflation is near our 

2 percent target.  The economy is growing at an annual rate of about 3 percent, well 

above most estimates of its longer-run trend.   

For seven years during the crisis and its painful aftermath, the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) kept our policy interest rate unprecedentedly low--in fact, 

near zero--to support the economy as it struggled to recover.  The health of the economy 

gradually but steadily improved, and about three years ago the FOMC judged that the 

interests of households and businesses, of savers and borrowers, were no longer best 

served by such extraordinarily low rates.  We therefore began to raise our policy rate

gradually toward levels that are more normal in a healthy economy.  Interest rates are still 

low by historical standards, and they remain just below the broad range of estimates of 

the level that would be neutral for the economy--that is, neither speeding up nor slowing 

down growth.  My FOMC colleagues and I, as well as many private-sector economists, 

are forecasting continued solid growth, low unemployment, and inflation near 2 percent.   

There is a great deal to like about this outlook.  But we know that things often 

turn out to be quite different from even the most careful forecasts.  For this reason, sound 

policymaking is as much about managing risks as it is about responding to the baseline 

forecast.  Our gradual pace of raising interest rates has been an exercise in balancing 

risks.  We know that moving too fast would risk shortening the expansion.  We also know 

that moving too slowly--keeping interest rates too low for too long--could risk other 

distortions in the form of higher inflation or destabilizing financial imbalances.  Our path 

of gradual increases has been designed to balance these two risks, both of which we must 

take seriously.   

We also know that the economic effects of our gradual rate increases are 

uncertain, and may take a year or more to be fully realized.  While FOMC participants’ 

projections are based on our best assessments of the outlook, there is no preset policy 

path.  We will be paying very close attention to what incoming economic and financial 

data are telling us.  As always, our decisions on monetary policy will be designed to keep 

the economy on track in light of the changing outlook for jobs and inflation.   

Under the dual mandate, jobs and inflation are the Fed’s meat and potatoes.  In 

the rest of my comments, I will focus on financial stability--a topic that has always been 

on the menu, but that, since the crisis, has become a more integral part of the meal.

Historical Perspective on Financial Stability  

The term “financial stability” has a particular meaning in this context.  A stable 

financial system is one that continues to function effectively even in severely adverse 

conditions.  A stable system meets the borrowing and investment needs of households 

and businesses despite economic turbulence.  An unstable system, in contrast, may 

amplify turbulence and prolong economic hardship in the face of stress by failing to 

provide these essential services when they are needed most.  

For Economic Club of New York trivia buffs, I will note that the second ever 

presentation to this club by a Federal Reserve official was about this very topic.  The date 

was March 18, 1929.  Weeks before, the Fed had issued a public statement of concern 

over stock market speculation, and had provided guidance frowning on bank funding of 

such speculation.  William Harding, a former Fed Chair and then president of the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Boston, defended the Fed’s actions in his talk.  He argued that, while the 

Fed should not act as the arbiter of correct asset prices, it did have a primary 

responsibility to protect the banking system’s capacity to meet the credit needs of 

households and businesses.  At the meeting, critics argued that public statements about 

inflated asset prices were “fraught with danger;” that the nation’s banks were so well 

managed that they should not “face public admonition”; and, more generally, that the Fed 

was “out of its sphere.”1  Of course, Harding spoke just a few months before the 1929 

stock market crash, which signaled the onset of the Great Depression.2 

                                                 
1 See remarks of W.P.G. Harding at a dinner of the Economic Club of New York on March 18, 1929, as 
reported in “Clash on Policies of Reserve Board” by the New York Times on March 19, 1929, p. 52; and in 
“Reserve Policy Upheld and Hit” by the Wall Street Journal on March 19, 1929, p. 21.  Also see “Wall 
Street News and Comment,” Special Dispatch to the [Daily Boston] Globe, on March 24, 1929, p. A60.

Great Depression.  See Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the 
United States, 1867-1960 (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press); and Ben S. Bernanke (1983),

Fast forwarding, a host of Depression-era reforms helped avoid, for the next 

three-quarters of a century, a systemic financial crisis and the associated severe economic 

dislocation--the longest such period in American history.  Those decades saw many 

advances in monetary policy and in bank regulatory policy, but the appropriate role for 

government in managing threats to the broader financial system remained unresolved.  

Periodic bouts of financial stress during this period--such as the Latin American debt 

crisis, the savings and loan crisis, and the Russian debt default--were met with 

improvised responses.  Policymakers conjured fixes from a mixture of private-sector 

rescues, emergency liquidity, occasional implicit or explicit bailouts, and monetary 

accommodation.  Outside of these crisis responses, however, systemic issues were not a 

central focus of policy.  

The Global Financial Crisis demonstrated, in the clearest way, the limits of this 

approach.  Highly inventive and courageous improvisation amid scenes of great drama 

helped avoid another Great Depression, but failed to prevent the most severe recession in 

75 years.  The crisis made clear that there can be no macroeconomic stability without 

financial stability, and that systemic stability risks often take root and blossom in good 

times.3  Thus, as the emergency phase of the crisis subsided, Congress, the Fed, and the 

other financial regulators began developing a fundamentally different approach to 

financial stability.  Instead of relying on improvised responses after crises strike, 

policymakers now constantly monitor vulnerabilities and require firms to plan in advance

Crises:  Systemic or Idiosyncratic,” Working Paper 51, prepared for presentation at “Crisis in Finance,” a 
conference of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute, Bard College, April.

for financial distress, in a framework that lays out solutions in advance during good 

times.   

The New Approach to Financial Stability 

This new approach can be divided into three parts.  First, build up the strength and 

resilience of the financial system.  Second, develop and apply a broad framework for 

monitoring financial stability on an ongoing basis.  And third, explain the new approach 

as transparently as possible, so that the public and its representatives in Congress can 

provide oversight and hold us accountable for this work.  Although I’ll focus mainly on 

the stability efforts of the Federal Reserve, a number of federal regulatory agencies have 

responsibilities in this area.  All of these agencies are represented on the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, which is chaired by the Treasury Secretary and 

which provides a forum for interagency cooperation in responding to emerging risks.   

Building Resilience of the Financial System 

After 10 years of concentrated effort in the public and private sectors, the system 

is now much stronger, with greater capacity to function effectively in stressful times.  In 

the banking system, we have implemented a post-crisis regulatory framework based on 

robust capital and liquidity requirements, a strong stress-testing regime, and mandatory 

living wills for the largest firms.  As a result, banks now have much more high quality 

capital than before (figure 1).  The most recent stress tests indicate that, even after a 

severe global recession, capital levels at the largest banks would remain above regulatory 

minimums, and above the levels those banks held in good times before the crisis.4  The

preface.htm.

most systemically important financial institutions also now hold roughly 20 percent of 

their assets in the form of high quality liquid assets--that is, safe assets that could be 

readily sold at short notice (figure 2).  The share of these assets is about four times its 

pre-crisis level. 

Compared with other economies, lending and borrowing in the United States 

depend less on bank loans and more on funds flowing through a wide array of capital 

market channels.  The crisis revealed that this capital market centric system, despite its 

many benefits, also provides more places where systemic risks can emerge.  In response, 

Congress and the regulatory agencies have made many stability-enhancing changes 

outside of the banking system.  For example, many derivatives transactions are now 

required to be centrally cleared, which, through netting, has reduced exposures and 

enabled better management of counterparty risk.  Tri-party repurchase agreement (repo) 

reforms have substantially improved the resilience of that marketplace, in particular by 

limiting intraday loans.  Before the crisis, prime institutional money market funds were 

permitted to report a constant, $1 share price so long as the value of the underlying assets 

remained near $1.  This reporting convention, combined with the implicit support of the 

plans’ sponsors, led investors to treat those funds like bank deposits, even though they 

were not likewise insured.  These funds are now required to report floating net-asset 

values, and after this reform investors chose to migrate to government-only funds, which 

are safer and less susceptible to runs (figure 3).5  These and other measures have reduced 

the risk that key non-bank parts of the system would freeze up in the face of market 

stress.  

                                                 
5 Given that government money fund asset holdings are limited to safe assets, they are allowed to maintain 
a $1 share price.

A New Framework for Monitoring Systemic Risks  

Innovation and risk-taking contribute to the dynamism of our financial system and 

our economy.  As Hyman Minsky emphasized, along with the many benefits of 

dynamism comes the reality that the financial system will sometimes evolve toward 

excess and dangerous imbalances.6  This reality underscores the vital importance of the 

second part of post-crisis reform:  monitoring for emerging vulnerabilities.  

As laid out in our new Financial Stability Report, we have developed a 

framework to help us monitor risks to stability in our complex and rapidly evolving 

financial system.  The framework distinguishes between shocks, that is, trigger events 

that can be hard to predict or influence, and vulnerabilities, defined as features of the 

financial system that amplify shocks.  The report is organized around four broad 

vulnerabilities that have been prominent in financial crises through the centuries.  Each of 

these vulnerabilities is often found to some degree even in healthy market-based systems, 

and there is not, at present, any generally accepted standard for assessing at what level 

the vulnerabilities begin to pose serious stability risks.  In lieu of such a standard, we flag 

cases in which the vulnerabilities rise well beyond historical norms, and then form 

judgments about the stability risks those cases present.  

The first vulnerability is excessive leverage in the financial sector.7  If a highly 

leveraged segment of the financial system is buffeted by adverse events, the affected 

entities may all need to deleverage at the same time by selling assets, leading to what is 

called a “fire sale.”  Both the resulting decline in asset prices and the impaired ability of 

the segment to play its role in the economy can amplify the effects of a downturn.  We 

                                                 
6 See Minsky, “Financial Crises,” in note 3. 
7 A more highly leveraged sector is one that relies more heavily on borrowed money.

saw this chain of events play out repeatedly in various parts of the financial sector in the 

weeks following the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008.   

In our surveillance, we examine leverage across many types of financial 

institutions, including banks, insurance companies, hedge funds, and various funding 

vehicles.  Currently, we do not detect a broad-based buildup of abnormal or excessive 

leverage.  As with banks, capital levels at insurance companies and broker-dealers appear 

robust.  In addition, securitization levels are far below their pre-crisis levels, and those 

structures that do exist rely on more stable funding (see figure 4).  Our view into leverage 

and risk-taking outside the banking sector is admittedly incomplete, however, and we are 

always working to get a better view of emerging leverage excesses.8 

The second vulnerability is funding risk, which arises when banks or nonbank 

financial entities rely on funding that can be rapidly withdrawn.  If depositors or market 

participants lose faith in the soundness of an institution or the system as a whole, unstable 

funding can simply vanish in what is called a “run.”  During the crisis, we saw 

widespread runs, including at broker-dealers, some segments of the repo market, and 

money market mutual funds.  These runs did severe damage, contributing to a 

generalized panic at the time.  Had the authorities not stepped in, the damage could have 

been even more severe.   

Today we view funding-risk vulnerabilities as low.  Banks hold low levels of 

liabilities that are able and likely to run, and they hold high levels of liquid assets to fund 

any outflows that do occur.  Money market mutual fund reforms have greatly reduced the 

run risk in that sector.  More generally, it is short-term, uninsured funding that would be 

                                                 
8 Sometimes we look to bank lending for information.  Data from the stress tests suggest that the nation’s 
largest banks have committed about $1 trillion in lines of credit to nonbanks.   


 - 9 - 

most likely to run in a future stress event, and the volume of such funding is now 

significantly below pre-crisis peaks.   

Taken together, the evidence on these first two vulnerabilities strongly supports 

the view that financial institutions and markets are substantially more resilient than they 

were before the crisis.  Indeed, the American financial system has successfully weathered 

some periods of significant stress over the past several years.9  

The third vulnerability is excessive debt loads at households and businesses.  

Credit booms have often led to credit busts and sometimes to painful economic 

downturns.  When the bust comes, those who have overborrowed tend to sharply reduce 

their spending.  Defaults typically rise faster than had been expected, which may put 

financial institutions into distress.  These effects may combine to bring a serious 

economic downturn. 

This boom-bust pattern was clear in measures of household debt around the crisis 

period, with mortgage debt rising far above its historical trend and then contracting 

sharply (see figure 5).  After the contraction, household debt has grown only moderately.  

The net increase in mortgage debt has been among borrowers with higher credit scores.  

While heavily indebted households always suffer in a downturn, all of this suggests that 

household debt would not present a systemic stability threat if the economy sours.  

Nonfinancial business borrowing presents a subtler story.  With corporate debt, 

the United States has not faced a massive credit boom like that experienced with 

residential mortgages before the recent crisis.  Instead, after controlling for its trend, 

                                                 
9 Examples include episodes of intensified concerns over euro-area fiscal challenges, the discontinuous and 
large appreciation of the Swiss franc in January 2015, and the market volatility associated with global 
growth concerns in late 2015.   


 - 10 - 

business borrowing relative GDP has risen during expansions, no doubt reflecting 

business optimism, and then fallen when the cycle turned, as some of that optimism 

proved unfounded (see figure 6).  By this measure, the ratio of corporate debt to GDP is 

about where one might expect after nearly a decade of economic expansion: it is well 

above its trend, but not yet at the peaks hit in the late 1980s or late 1990s.  Further, the 

upward trend in recent years appears broadly consistent with the growth in business 

assets relative to GDP.   

There are reasons for concern, however.  Information on individual firms reveals 

that, over the past year, firms with high leverage and interest burdens have been 

increasing their debt loads the most (see figure 7).  In addition, other measures of 

underwriting quality have deteriorated, and leverage multiples have moved up.  Some of 

these highly leveraged borrowers would surely face distress if the economy turned down, 

leading investors to take higher-than-expected losses--developments that could 

exacerbate the downturn.  The question for financial stability is whether elevated 

business bankruptcies and outsized losses would risk undermining the ability of the 

financial system to perform its critical functions on behalf of households and businesses.  

For now, my view is that such losses are unlikely to pose a threat to the safety and 

soundness of the institutions at the core of the system and, instead, are likely to fall on 

investors in vehicles like collateralized loan obligations with stable funding that present 

little threat of damaging fire sales.10  Of course, we will continue to monitor 

developments in this sector carefully.

delivered at the Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, N.Y., February 18, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20150218a.htm. 


 - 11 - 

The fourth and final vulnerability arises when asset values rise far above 

conventional, historically observed valuation benchmarks--a phenomenon popularly 

referred to as a “bubble.”  The contentious term “bubble” does not appear in our work, 

however.11  Instead, we focus is on the extent to which an asset’s price is high or low 

relative to conventional benchmarks based on expected payoffs and current economic 

conditions.  Historically, when asset prices soar far above standard benchmarks, sharp 

declines follow with some regularity, and those declines may bring economic misery 

reaching far beyond investors directly involved in the speculative boom.  We therefore 

pay close attention when valuations get to the extreme ends of what we have seen in 

history.   

Looking across the landscape of major asset classes, we see some classes for 

which valuations seem high relative to history.  For example, even after standard 

adjustments for economic conditions, valuations on riskier forms of corporate debt and 

commercial properties are in the upper ends of their post-crisis distributions, although 

they are short of the levels they hit in the pre-crisis credit boom.  We see no major asset 

class, however, where valuations appear far in excess of standard benchmarks as some 

did, for example, in the late 1990s dot-com boom or the pre-crisis credit boom. 

The asset class that gets the most attention day-to-day is, of course, the stock 

market. Today, equity market prices are broadly consistent with historical benchmarks 

such as forward price-to-earnings ratios (see figure 8).  It is important to distinguish 

between market volatility and events that threaten financial stability.  Large, sustained 

                                                 
11 Analysts differ over how to define the term “bubble,” and debate continues about the degree to which 
economic fundamentals might explain even the most famous apparent bubble cases from history.  On the 
topic of tulip mania, for example, see Peter M. Garber (1989), “Tulipmania,” Journal of Political Economy, 
vol. 97 (June), pp. 535-60.” 


 - 12 - 

declines in equity prices can put downward pressure on spending and confidence.  From 

the financial stability perspective, however, today we do not see dangerous excesses in 

the stock market.  

Monitoring Likely Triggers for Financial Distress  

I mentioned the distinction between vulnerabilities and shocks, or triggers.  In 

addition to monitoring vulnerabilities under our four-part framework, we also consult a 

broad range of contacts regarding sources of risk that might trigger distress at any given 

time.  For example, discussions with contacts currently point to risks emanating from the 

normalization of monetary policy in the United States and elsewhere, the unsettled state 

of trade negotiations, Brexit negotiations, budget discussions between Italy and the 

European Union, and cyber-related disruptions.12  

Having identified possible triggers, we can assess how a particular trigger is likely 

to interact with known vulnerabilities.  A good current example is that of Brexit.  U.S. 

banks and broker-dealers participate in some of the markets most likely to be affected by 

Brexit.  The Fed and other regulators have been working with U.S. financial institutions 

that have operations in the European Union or the United Kingdom to prepare for the full 

range of possible outcomes to the negotiations.  In addition, the scenarios used in the 

stress tests routinely feature severe global contractions and show that U.S. banks have the 

capital to weather even highly disruptive events.  

                                                 
12 The Financial Stability Report does not currently have a standard set of metrics for determining the 
resiliency of critical financial systems to cyber disruptions.  Nonetheless, cyber risks are the subject of 
ongoing policy efforts at that Federal Reserve and other relevant agencies, and these entities are working to 
develop resiliency expectations and measures, which may be part of future discussions in the stability 
report.

Bottom Line: Financial Stability Risks Are Moderate 

I have reviewed a few of the key facts that inform our thinking about financial 

stability, and you will find a great deal more detail in our new report.  You will also find 

that the report does not come to a bottom line conclusion.  As I noted earlier, we have 

limited experience with this monitoring, and there is no widely accepted basis for 

reaching a bottom line.  Thus, the purpose of the report is to provide a common platform 

and set of readings from which policymakers and other interested parties can form their 

own views.  Individual policymakers will sometimes differ in their assessments and on 

the relative weight they put on particular vulnerabilities.  My own assessment is that, 

while risks are above normal in some areas and below normal in others, overall financial 

stability vulnerabilities are at a moderate level.13   

In my view, the most important feature of the stability landscape is the strength of 

the financial system.  The risks of destabilizing runs are far lower than in the past.  The 

institutions at the heart of the financial system are more resilient.  The stress tests 

routinely feature extremely severe downturns in business credit, and the largest banks 

have the capital and liquidity to continue to function under such circumstances.  Because 

this core resilience is so important, we are committed to preserving and strengthening the 

key improvements since the crisis, particularly those in capital, liquidity, stress testing, 

and resolution. 

                                                 
13 The staff have also assessed financial stability vulnerabilities as moderate.  For instance, see the minutes 
of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, July 31-August 1, 2018, available on the Board’s website 
at https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20180822a.htm.

Conclusion 

I’d like to conclude by putting financial stability and our two new reports in a 

longer-term context.  To paraphrase a famous line, “eternal vigilance is the price of 

financial stability.”  We will publish these reports regularly as part of our vigilance.   

Over time, some may be tempted to dismiss the reports entirely or to 

overdramatize any concerns they raise.  Instead, these reports should be viewed as you 

might view the results of a regular health checkup.  We all hope for a report that is not 

very exciting.  Many baby boomers like me are, however, reaching an age where a good 

report is, “Well, there are a number of things we should keep an eye on, but all things 

considered you are in good health.”  That is how I view the Financial Stability Report out 

today.   

We hope that this report and the Supervision and Regulation Report will be 

important tools, sharing Federal Reserve views and stimulating public dialogue regarding 

the stability of the financial system.
