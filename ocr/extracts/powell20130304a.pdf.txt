Ending “Too Big to Fail”  




Remarks by

Institute of International Bankers 2013 Washington Conference

Today I will discuss “too big to fail” and the ongoing work since the financial crisis to 

end it.
1
  More than three years into this effort, there have been sweeping reforms to the 

regulation of large financial organizations in the United States and around the world.  Substantial 

proportions of the new rules are designed to end the practice of bailing out such firms with 

taxpayer money.  The too-big-to-fail reform project is massive in scope.  In my view, it holds 

real promise. But the project will take years to complete. Success is not assured.  

In the meantime, some urge the adoption of more intrusive reforms, such as a return to 

Glass-Steagall-style activity limits, more stringent limits on size or systemic footprint, or a 

requirement that the largest institutions break up into much smaller pieces.  I believe that public 

discussion and evaluation of these ideas is important.  At a minimum, we need to thoroughly 

understand these alternatives in case the existing reform project falters. 

It is worth noting that too big to fail is not simply about size.  A big institution is “too 

big” when there is an expectation that government will do whatever it takes to rescue that 

institution from failure, thus bestowing an effective risk premium subsidy.  Reforms to end too 

big to fail must address the causes of this expectation.   

In broad terms, these reforms seek to eliminate the expectation of bailouts in two ways--

by significantly reducing the likelihood of systemic firm failures, and by greatly limiting the 

costs to society of such failures.  When failures are unusual and the costs of such a failure are 

modest, the expectation at the heart of too big to fail will be substantially eliminated.  My focus 

today is principally on the second of these two aspects of reform--containing the costs and 

systemic risks from failures, a goal being advanced by work to create a credible resolution 

authority.

I hope you won’t mind if I draw today on some of my own experiences over the years 

with too big to fail, beginning with my service at the Treasury Department during the 

Administration of President George H.W. Bush.  I joined the Administration only a few years 

after the rescue of Continental Illinois, which is sometimes said to have codified the practice of 

too big to fail.   

In my years at Treasury, we faced a wave of well over 1,000 savings and loan and bank 

failures. That included the failure of the Bank of New England Corp., then the third largest bank 

failure in U.S. history.
2
  It happened in January 1991, at a time of great stress in the financial 

system and the broader economy, and only days after 45 depository institutions in the region had 

been closed and 300,000 deposit accounts frozen.
3
  My Treasury colleagues and I joined 

representatives of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve 

Board in a conference room on a Sunday morning.  We came to understand that either the FDIC 

would protect all of the bank’s depositors, without regard to deposit insurance limits, or there 

would likely be a run on all the money center banks the next morning--the first such run since 

1933.   We chose the first option, without dissent.

In the summer of 1991, we faced the Salomon Brothers crisis.  Salomon, a global 

investment bank, was one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, and the largest 

dealer in U.S. government securities.  The firm came under severe market pressure after some of 

its traders were caught submitting phony bids in Treasury bond auctions.   As recounted in 

harrowing detail in the book “The Snowball,” Salomon came within hours of failure over a 

                                                 
2
 Ranked by total assets at the time of failure, in 1991 Bank of New England Corp. ($21.7 billion) was the largest 

U.S. bank failure following Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust ($40 billion; 1984) and First Republic 

Bank ($32.5 billion; 1988).

  Salomon was clearly understood to be outside the safety net, and I 

recall no discussion of a government rescue.  But the firm’s failure would almost certainly have 

caused massive disruption in the markets.  To this day, I am grateful that we resolved that crisis 

with neither a bailout nor a failure.   

Over 20 years later, both these events still frame the too big to fail reform agenda.  Faced 

with the failure of a large commercial bank, we chose to extend the safety net rather than run the 

very real risk of a systemic depositor run.  Our “near miss” with Salomon in 1991 presaged the 

enormous damage that would result from the failure of Lehman Brothers, another investment 

bank, in 2008.  In fact, the dimension of the problem grew substantially over the years.  Since 

1991, the ratio of U.S. banking assets to annual gross domestic product in the United States has 

more than doubled, from 55 percent to 126 percent.  Meanwhile, the percentage of those assets 

held by the largest three institutions has increased from 14 to 32 percent.   

Bailouts may have been more tolerable in the early 1990s when they were rare and their 

use for a failing bank was uncertain.  That is no longer the case.  Recent years have seen large 

and numerous bailouts as a result of the financial crisis.  The public, the regulatory community, 

and large financial institutions themselves all agree now that too big to fail must end.   

As I said earlier, reforms to end too big to fail must wage the fight on two fronts.  First, 

we need enhanced regulation to make large financial institution failures much less likely.  

Second, we need a credible mechanism to manage the failure of even the largest firms, without 

causing or amplifying a systemic crisis.     

Let’s survey what has been proposed and implemented thus far in that two-front war on 

too big to fail.

Reducing the Probability of Default of Systemic Financial Firms 

Much has been done since the crisis to strengthen the regulation of large banking 

organizations.  The highlights would begin with the Basel III capital and liquidity reforms, 

including the graduated risk-based capital surcharges for globally systemic financial firms.  

These reforms are in the process of implementation in the United States and elsewhere.   In 

addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank) 

imposes on the largest financial institutions enhanced prudential standards and also requires 

central clearing of derivatives.   And banking regulators have implemented enhanced supervisory 

measures such as stress testing and recovery planning.   

While these measures are not the primary focus of my remarks today, I believe that they 

collectively constitute a broad and well-structured agenda to strengthen the resilience of the 

financial system.  The Federal Reserve and the rest of the regulatory community are working 

diligently to implement that agenda.   

Today, risk-based capital and leverage ratios for banks of all sizes have improved 

materially since 2009 and are significantly above their levels in the years preceding the crisis.  

The banking sector overall also has substantially improved its liquidity position over the past few 

years.  The system is undeniably stronger than before the crisis.

Reducing the Systemwide Loss Given Default of Systemic Financial Firms  

It is neither possible nor desirable to regulate large financial institutions so that they 

literally cannot fail. But regulation can limit the systemwide impact of such a failure. Let’s

review what has been done since the crisis to reduce the damage to the system from the failure of 

one of the very largest firms. 

Under Dodd-Frank, nearly all financial institution failures, including those of large, 

complex institutions, will continue to be addressed as they were before passage of the new law.  

The holding company will be resolved in bankruptcy.  Operating subsidiary failures will 

continue to be treated either under bankruptcy or, where applicable, under specialized resolution 

schemes, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Act for banks and the Securities Investor 

Protection Act for securities firms.   

Dodd-Frank eliminated the authority used by the Federal Reserve and other regulators to 

bail out individual institutions during the crisis, including Bear Stearns, Citicorp, Bank of 

America and AIG.  But Congress also recognized that there may be rare instances in which the 

failure of a large financial firm could threaten the financial stability of the United States.  To 

empower regulators to handle such a failure without destabilizing the financial system or 

exposing taxpayers to loss, Dodd-Frank created two important new regulatory tools.     

First, the Act requires large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms 

designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council to submit a resolution plan or “living 

will” for their rapid and orderly resolution under the Bankruptcy Code.  Second, the Act created 

a new Orderly Liquidation Authority (OLA) as a backup to resolution in an ordinary bankruptcy. 

The largest bank holding companies submitted their first annual “living wills” to the 

Federal Reserve and the FDIC last summer.  The initial round has yielded valuable information 

that is being used to identify and assess key challenges to resolvability under the Bankruptcy 

Code (Title I plans).  The Title I plans will help to focus firm efforts to mitigate those challenges 


- 6 - 


so that bankruptcy may be a viable resolution strategy for large institutions.    These plans will 

also support development of the FDIC’s backup resolution plans under OLA (Title II plans).   

The resolution plan process is iterative by design.  There is still much work to be done by 

firms, domestic and foreign regulators, and national governments.  We remain committed to 

ensuring that this work is done quickly but responsibly in the coming years. 

That brings us to the question of special resolution regimes.  In October 2011, 

immediately before I was nominated to the Federal Reserve Board, I helped design a public 

simulation of the failure of a large financial institution under OLA.  The cast included former 

senior government officials as well as leading experts from the private sector.  The FDIC, the 

Federal Reserve, and the industry offered their assistance as we developed the simulation. 

From the outset, my earlier experience had led me to be skeptical about the possibility of 

resolving one of the largest financial companies without destabilizing the financial system.  

Today’s global financial institutions are of staggering size and complexity.  I believed that an 

attempt to resolve one of these firms--a firm with multiple business lines carried out through 

countless legal entities, across many jurisdictions and different legal systems--could easily spin 

out of control.  The result could be greatly increased uncertainty for creditors and counterparties, 

which could trigger or accelerate a run on the failed institution that could quickly spread and 

destabilize the whole system. 

As we developed the simulation, however, I came around to the view that it is possible to 

resolve a large, global financial institution.  What changed my mind was the FDIC’s innovative 

“single-point-of-entry” approach, which was just coming into focus in 2011.  This approach is a 

classic simplifier, making theoretically possible something that seemed impossibly complex.   


- 7 - 


Under single point of entry, the FDIC will be appointed receiver of only the top-tier 

parent holding company of the failed financial group.  Promptly after the parent holding 

company is placed into receivership, the FDIC will transfer the assets of the parent company 

(primarily its investments in subsidiaries) to a bridge holding company.  Equity claims of the 

failed parent company’s shareholders will be wiped out, and claims of its unsecured debt holders 

will be written down as necessary to reflect any losses in the receivership that the shareholders 

cannot cover.  To capitalize the bridge holding company and the operating subsidiaries, and to 

permit transfer of ownership and control of the bridge company back to private hands, the FDIC 

will exchange the remaining claims of unsecured creditors of the parent for equity and/or debt 

claims of the bridge company.  If necessary, the FDIC would provide temporary liquidity to the 

bridge company until the “bail-in” of the failed parent company’s creditors can be accomplished. 

It is crucial to recognize how this approach addresses the problem of runs.  Single point 

of entry is designed to focus losses on the shareholders and long-term debt holders of the failed 

parent and to produce a well-capitalized bridge holding company in place of the failed parent.  

The critical operating subsidiaries would be well capitalized, and would remain open for 

business.  There would be much reduced incentives for creditors or customers of the operating 

subsidiaries to pull away, or for regulators to ring-fence or take other extraordinary measures.  If 

the process can be fully worked out and understood by market participants, regulators, and the 

general public, it should work to resolve even the biggest institution without starting or 

accelerating a run, and without exposing taxpayers to loss. 

Single point of entry has important features in common with Chapter 11 bankruptcy 

reorganization.  The principal differences in favor of OLA are the greater speed at which a firm 


- 8 - 


can be placed into a resolution process and stabilized, the ability to avoid disruptive creditor 

actions, and the availability of temporary backup liquidity support to continue critical operations.  

  Some have proposed changes to adapt the Bankruptcy Code to the purpose of handling 

the failure of a large financial institution--for example, to allow the government to provide 

debtor in possession (DIP) financing, or to allow a firm’s primary regulator to initiate a 

bankruptcy filing.
7
  At a minimum, these proposals would further limit the need for OLA to the 

rarest of cases. 

As the development of the single-point-of-entry approach continues, it is important to 

continue to reduce the uncertainties that creditors and other market participants would face in 

connection with their potential treatment in OLA.  Questions remain about how the FDIC will 

apply its broad statutory discretion.  For example: How will the FDIC exercise its discretion to 

dissimilarly treat creditors of the same class?  How will a creditor’s “minimum right of 

recovery” be determined?  And how will the FDIC value the failed firm?   Stability demands that 

market participants have a reasonable degree of certainty about their treatment in OLA ex ante.  

This is an important concern.   

To reduce uncertainty, the FDIC is working to provide market participants as much 

clarity as is feasible regarding its contemplated approach to the failure of a systemic U.S. firm. 

Regulators will always need to maintain some degree of flexibility to manage the evolving 

failure of a systemic financial firm.  But greater clarity would increase the predictability of this 

new process, and thus reduce the likelihood that creditors, counterparties, and customers would 

pull away from even a well-capitalized institution in OLA.  I strongly support these efforts to 

provide more clarity to market participants.

Two remaining challenges loom large: ensuring that all systemic financial firms have 

sufficient unsecured long-term debt at the parent level to recapitalize a bridge holding company 

in OLA; and mitigating cross-border impediments to resolution of a multinational financial firm. 

In consultation with the FDIC, the Federal Reserve is considering the pros and cons of a 

regulatory requirement that systemic U.S. financial firms maintain a minimum amount of long-

term unsecured debt.  Such a requirement would help ensure that equity and long-term debt 

holders of a systemic firm can bear potential future losses at the firm and sufficiently capitalize a 

bridge holding company.     

The cross-border activities of large institutions present another set of challenges to an 

orderly resolution.  OLA is limited in its applicability to U.S.-chartered entities.  Subsidiaries and 

bank branches of a U.S.-based systemic firm chartered in other countries could be ring-fenced or 

wound down separately under the insolvency laws of those countries, if foreign authorities did 

not have full confidence that local interests would be protected.  Certain OLA stabilization 

mechanisms, including the one-day stay provision with respect to over-the-counter derivatives 

and other qualified financial contracts, may not apply outside the United States.  Accordingly, 

counterparties to qualified financial contracts with the foreign subsidiaries and branches of a 

U.S. firm may have contractual rights and substantial economic incentives to terminate their 

transactions as soon as the U.S. parent enters an OLA resolution.  Today, regulators and the 

industry are focused on the potential for addressing this concern through modifications to 

contractual cross-default practices and other means.    

Further progress on these cross-border challenges will require significant coordination 

among U.S. regulators and the key foreign central banks and supervisors for the largest financial 

firms.  For example, the FDIC and the Bank of England are deeply engaged in this important 


- 10 - 


work, as recently described in their joint paper applying the single-point-of-entry framework to 

the resolution of a globally active, U.S. - or U.K.-headquartered banking firm.
8
  The FDIC also 

has an active dialogue with the European Commission.  These challenges will also require 

foreign jurisdictions to have national resolution regimes consistent with the Financial Stability 

Board’s “Key Attributes.”

Assessing Progress on Too Big to Fail 

It seems to me that efforts by U.S. and global regulators to fight too big to fail are 

generally on the right track.  The Basel III and Dodd-Frank reforms designed to reduce the 

probability of failure of large banking firms are sensible and, for the most part, targeted at the 

causes of the crisis.  They are being implemented thoughtfully and effectively.   And I believe 

that those Financial Stability Board and Dodd-Frank reforms designed to permit the resolution of 

systemic firms without taxpayer exposure or undue disruption are very promising.  That said, 

much of the work lies ahead. 

The critics also deserve a fair hearing.   

Criticism of the current U.S. and global anti-too-big-to-fail policies generally takes one of 

two tacks.  Some of the criticism argues that Dodd-Frank--particularly the OLA mechanism-- 

enshrines taxpayer bailouts.  I do not believe that it does.  OLA requires by its terms that the 

losses of any financial company placed into FDIC receivership be borne by the private sector 

stockholders and creditors of the firm.  Single point of entry can work without exposing 

taxpayers to loss.

Important, Financial Institutions” (December 10). 
9
 The Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions (Key Attributes) were adopted by 

the Financial Stability Board in November 2011 as a new international standard that sets out the core elements of an 

effective special resolution regime for systemically significant financial firms. 


- 11 - 


Although the FDIC has authority to provide temporary liquidity to a failed firm, any costs 

incurred by the FDIC in resolving the firm must be recovered completely from either the assets 

of the firm or assessments on the financial industry.  The failed firm’s investors, and, if 

necessary, other large financial firms, will bear any costs. That is “bail-in,” not “bailout.” 

 Another strand of criticism argues that reforms do not go far enough and calls for more 

activity limits on banking firms, for limiting their size or systemic footprint, or for simply 

breaking them up.   

Activity Limits  

Some have urged the resurrection of the 1930s-era Glass-Steagall prohibitions--that is, 

preventing the affiliation of commercial banks with investment banks.  This proposal seems 

neither directly related to the causes of the financial crisis, nor likely to help end too big to fail.  

The systemic run that led to the financial crisis began with traditional investment banks, such as 

Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers.  The activities of these firms were, of course, not affected by 

the repeal of Glass-Steagall.  Commercial banking firms now engage in activities traditionally 

associated with investment banking, such as securities underwriting.  The combination of these 

activities under a single corporate umbrella did not contribute meaningfully to the financial 

crisis.  In my view, losses at the commercial banks were more importantly a consequence of bad 

credit underwriting and the failure of risk management systems to keep up with innovation and 

the explosive growth in securitization--developments that were not fundamentally driven by the 

repeal of Glass-Steagall.  

Size Limits 

There are also calls to further limit the size or systemic footprint of financial firms.  

Limits of this nature require, and deserve, careful analysis.   


- 12 - 


Two provisions of existing law already impose size caps on U.S. banking firms.  One 

limits acquisitions of banks by any bank holding company that controls more than 10 percent of 

the total insured deposits in the United States, and a second, added by Dodd-Frank, forbids 

acquisitions by any financial firm that controls more than 10 percent of the total liabilities of 

financial firms in the United States.  In addition, Dodd-Frank added a new requirement that 

banking regulators consider “risk to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system” in 

evaluating any proposed merger or acquisition by a bank or bank holding company.  Critics 

argue that these restrictions are inadequate and subject to exceptions that continue to allow even 

the largest firms to grow, both organically and through acquisitions.   

The simplest forms of this idea would put a further absolute limit on the amount of 

balance sheet assets or liabilities, or on the risk-weighted assets of a financial firm.  Capping the 

size or systemic footprint of each financial firm would limit the adverse systemic effects of the 

failure of any single firm.  Smaller, simpler financial firms should be easier to manage and 

supervise in life, and easier to resolve in death.  One option would be to impose a cap on a large 

U.S. banking firm’s short-term non-deposit liabilities as a fraction of U.S. GDP.  This form of 

proposal would allow such a firm to continue to increase assets and diversify its activities to 

achieve potentially available economies of scale and scope, so long as the firm finances 

expansion through more stable forms of funding.
10


Any new size limits should be designed to limit systemic footprint while minimizing 

costs to efficiency.   This will be a challenging task.  The question of whether the benefits of

further size limits would exceed any losses in scale economies and other efficiencies is the 

subject of ongoing research and debate.
11


Break-up 

Some critics want to get right to the business of breaking up the big banks into smaller, 

more manageable, more easily resolvable pieces.
12

  At the heart of this proposal is the thought 

that no financial institution should be so large or complex that it cannot be allowed to fail, like 

any other private business, with losses to its equity holders and creditors, and consequences for 

senior management.   If the largest institutions were too big to fail during the financial crisis, 

why not make them smaller? 

Today, the market still appears to provide a subsidy, of changing and uncertain amount, 

to very large banks to account for the possibility of a government bailout in the event of failure.
13


This subsidy, in the form of lower funding costs, may encourage “too-bigness.”  There would be 

substantial externalities to a large bank failure as well.   

The market needs to believe--and it needs to be the case--that every private financial 

institution can fail and be resolved under our laws without imposing undue costs on society.  The

current reform agenda is designed to accomplish just that, through two channels.  First, it is 

intended to substantially reduce the likelihood of failure through a broad range of stronger 

regulation, including higher capital and liquidity standards, stress tests and recovery planning 

among other reforms.  Second, it is intended to minimize the externalities from failure by making 

it possible to resolve a large financial institution without taxpayer exposure and without 

uncontainable disruption.  If these reforms achieve their purpose, in my view they would be 

preferable to a government-imposed break-up, which would likely involve arbitrary judgments, 

efficiency losses, and a difficult transition.   

Conclusion 

Today, few ideas can be less controversial than ending too big to fail.  The question is 

“How?”, and there are differing opinions on that.  In Titles I and II of Dodd-Frank, Congress has 

given the regulators a game plan for ending too big to fail.  The regulators, including the Federal 

Reserve, are forcefully implementing the plan we have been given.     

My own view is that the framework of current reforms is promising, and should be given 

time to work.  In any case, too big to fail must end, even if more intrusive measures prove 

necessary in the end. 

Thank you very much.
