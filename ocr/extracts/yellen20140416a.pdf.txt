April 16, 2014 



Nearly five years into the expansion that began after the financial crisis and the 

Great Recession, the recovery has come a long way.  More than 8 million jobs have been 

added to nonfarm payrolls since 2009, almost the same number lost as a result of the 

recession.  Led by a resurgent auto industry, manufacturing output has also nearly 

returned to its pre-recession peak.  While the housing market still has far to go, it seems 

to have turned a corner.   

It is a sign of how far the economy has come that a return to full employment is, 

for the first time since the crisis, in the medium-term outlooks of many forecasters.  It is a 

reminder of how far we have to go, however, that this long-awaited outcome is projected 

to be more than two years away.  

Today I will discuss how my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) and I view the state of the economy and how this view is likely to shape our 

efforts to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.  I will 

start with the FOMC’s outlook, which foresees a gradual return over the next two to three 

years of economic conditions consistent with its mandate.  

While monetary policy discussions naturally begin with a baseline outlook, the 

path of the economy is uncertain, and effective policy must respond to significant 

unexpected twists and turns the economy may take.  My primary focus today will be on 

how the FOMC’s monetary policy framework has evolved to best support the recovery 

through those twists and turns, and what this framework is likely to imply as the recovery 

progresses.

The Current Economic Outlook 

The FOMC’s current outlook for continued, moderate growth is little changed 

from last fall.  In recent months, some indicators have been notably weak, requiring us to 

judge whether the data are signaling a material change in the outlook.  The unusually 

harsh winter weather in much of the nation has complicated this judgment, but my 

FOMC colleagues and I generally believe that a significant part of the recent softness was 

weather related.  

The continued improvement in labor market conditions has been important in this 

judgment.  The unemployment rate, at 6.7 percent, has fallen three-tenths of 1 percentage 

point since late last year.  Broader measures of unemployment that include workers 

marginally attached to the labor force and those working part time for economic reasons 

have fallen a bit more than the headline unemployment rate, and labor force participation, 

which had been falling, has ticked up this year.   

Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, 

has slowed from an annual rate of about 2-1/2 percent in early 2012 to less than 1 percent 

in February of this year.1  This rate is well below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run 

objective.  Many advanced economies are observing a similar softness in inflation.  

To some extent, the low rate of inflation seems due to influences that are likely to 

be temporary, including a deceleration in consumer energy prices and outright declines in 

core import prices in recent quarters.  Longer-run inflation expectations have remained 

remarkably steady, however.  We anticipate that, as the effects of transitory factors 

subside and as labor market gains continue, inflation will gradually move back toward 

2 percent.  
                                                 
1 These inflation rates are based on 12-month changes. 


 - 3 - 

In sum, the central tendency of FOMC participant projections for the 

unemployment rate at the end of 2016 is 5.2 to 5.6 percent, and for inflation the central 

tendency is 1.7 to 2 percent. 2  If this forecast was to become reality, the economy would 

be approaching what my colleagues and I view as maximum employment and price 

stability for the first time in nearly a decade.  I find this baseline outlook quite plausible.  

Of course, if the economy obediently followed our forecasts, the job of central 

bankers would be a lot easier and their speeches would be a lot shorter.  Alas, the 

economy is often not so compliant, so I will ask your indulgence for a few more minutes.  

Three Big Questions for the FOMC 

Because the course of the economy is uncertain, monetary policymakers need to 

carefully watch for signs that it is diverging from the baseline outlook and then respond 

in a systematic way.  Let me turn first to monitoring and discuss three questions I believe 

are likely to loom large in the FOMC’s ongoing assessment of where we are on the path 

back to maximum employment and price stability. 

Is there still significant slack in the labor market? 

The first question concerns the extent of slack in the labor market.  One of the 

FOMC’s objectives is to promote a return to maximum employment, but exactly what 

conditions are consistent with maximum employment can be difficult to assess.  Thus far 

in the recovery and to this day, there is little question that the economy has remained far 

from maximum employment, so measurement difficulties were not our focus.  But as the 

attainment of our maximum employment goal draws nearer, it will be necessary for the 

                                                 
2 These figures are based on the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) submitted in conjunction with 
the March 2014 FOMC meeting.  The SEP is an addendum to the FOMC minutes and is available at Board 
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2014), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, 
March 18-19, 2014,” press release, April 9,

FOMC to form a more nuanced judgment about when the recovery of the labor market 

will be materially complete.  As the FOMC’s statement on longer-term goals and policy 

strategy emphasizes, these judgments are inherently uncertain and must be based on a 

wide range of indicators.3   

I will refer to the shortfall in employment relative to its mandate-consistent level 

as labor market slack, and there are a number of different indicators of this slack.  

Probably the best single indicator is the unemployment rate.  At 6.7 percent, it is now 

slightly more than 1 percentage point above the 5.2 to 5.6 percent central tendency of the 

Committee’s projections for the longer-run normal unemployment rate.  This shortfall 

remains significant, and in our baseline outlook, it will take more than two years to 

close.4   

Other data suggest that there may be more slack in labor markets than indicated 

by the unemployment rate.  For example, the share of the workforce that is working part 

time but would prefer to work full time remains quite high by historical standards.  

Similarly, while the share of workers in the labor force who are unemployed and have 

been looking for work for more than six months has fallen from its peak in 2010, it 

remains as high as any time prior to the Great Recession.5  There is ongoing debate about 

why long-term unemployment remains so high and the degree to which it might decline

January 28, 2014, which is available on the Board’s website at

4 See the SEP in Board of Governors, “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, March 18-19, 
2014,” in note 2. 
5 The share in CPS employment of persons working part time for economic reasons rose from 3 percent 
prior to the recession to 6.5 percent in November 2009, and it has since then declined only to 5 
percent.  The share in the labor force of those unemployed for more than 26 weeks rose from less than 1 
percent prior to the recession to 4.5 percent, and it has since declined to just below 2.5 percent; the previous 
peak for this series was 2.5 percent in 1983.  The records for long-term unemployed begin in 1948.

in a more robust economy.  As I argued more fully in a recent speech, I believe that long-

term unemployment might fall appreciably if economic conditions were stronger.6  

The low level of labor force participation may also signal additional slack that is 

not reflected in the headline unemployment rate.  Participation would be expected to fall 

because of the aging of the population, but the decline steepened in the recovery.  

Although economists differ over what share of those currently outside the labor market 

might join or rejoin the labor force in a stronger economy, my own view is that some 

portion of the decline in participation likely represents labor market slack.7   

Lastly, economists also look to wage pressures to signal a tightening labor market.  

At present, wage gains continue to proceed at a historically slow pace in this recovery, 

with few signs of a broad-based acceleration.  As the extent of slack we see today 

diminishes, however, the FOMC will need to monitor these and other labor market 

indicators closely to judge how much slack remains and, therefore, how accommodative 

monetary policy should be. 

Is inflation moving back toward 2 percent? 

A second question that is likely to figure heavily in our assessment of the 

recovery is whether inflation is moving back toward the FOMC’s 2 percent longer-run 

objective, as envisioned in our baseline outlook.  As the most recent FOMC statement

Philadelphia, special report, Research Rap, February 6, available at www.philadelphiafed.org/research-and-
data/publications/research-rap.  The view that a larger share of the recent decline reflects cyclical factors is 
expressed by Christopher J. Erceg and Andrew T. Levin (2013), “Labor Force Participation and Monetary 
Policy in the Wake of the Great Recession,” paper presented at “Fulfilling the Full Employment Mandate--

Boston, April 12, available at www.bostonfed.org/employment2013/agenda.htm.

emphasizes, inflation persistently below 2 percent could pose risks to economic 

performance.  

The FOMC strives to avoid inflation slipping too far below its 2 percent objective 

because, at very low inflation rates, adverse economic developments could more easily 

push the economy into deflation.  The limited historical experience with deflation shows 

that, once it starts, deflation can become entrenched and associated with prolonged 

periods of very weak economic performance.8 

A persistent bout of very low inflation carries other risks as well.  With the federal 

funds rate currently near its lower limit, lower inflation translates into a higher real value 

for the federal funds rate, limiting the capacity of monetary policy to support the 

economy.9  Further, with longer-term inflation expectations anchored near 2 percent in 

recent years, persistent inflation well below this expected value increases the real burden 

of debt for households and firms, which may put a drag on economic activity.   

I will mention two considerations that will be important in assessing whether 

inflation is likely to move back to 2 percent as the economy recovers.  First, we anticipate 

that, as labor market slack diminishes, it will exert less of a drag on inflation.  However, 

during the recovery, very high levels of slack have seemingly not generated strong 

downward pressure on inflation.  We must therefore watch carefully to see whether 

                                                 
8 See Ben S. Bernanke (2002), “Deflation:  Making Sure ‘It’ Doesn’t Happen Here,” speech delivered at the 
National Economists Club, Washington, November 21, 
www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/speeches/2002/20021121/default.htm. 
9 If firms’ and households’ spending decisions depended only on longer-term interest rates, temporarily 
higher short-term real interest rates due to low inflation at a time that nominal interest rates are constrained 
by the zero lower bound would have little economic effects, provided that these higher short-term real 
interest rates would be expected to be compensated by lower short-term real interest rates later on.  
However, to the extent that these spending decisions depend in part on shorter-term real interest rates, low 
inflation can induce meaningful economic costs.  


 - 7 - 

diminishing slack is helping return inflation to our objective.10  Second, our baseline 

projection rests on the view that inflation expectations will remain well anchored near 2 

percent and provide a natural pull back to that level.  But the strength of that pull in the 

unprecedented conditions we continue to face is something we must continue to assess. 

Finally, the FOMC is well aware that inflation could also threaten to rise 

substantially above 2 percent.  At present, I rate the chances of this happening as 

significantly below the chances of inflation persisting below 2 percent, but we must 

always be prepared to respond to such unexpected outcomes, which leads us to my third 

question. 

What factors may push the recovery off track? 

Myriad factors continuously buffet the economy, so the Committee must always 

be asking, “What factors may be pushing the recovery off track?”  For example, over the 

nearly 5 years of the recovery, the economy has been affected by greater-than-expected 

fiscal drag in the United States and by spillovers from the sovereign debt and banking 

problems of some euro-area countries.  Further, our baseline outlook has changed as we 

have learned about the degree of structural damage to the economy wrought by the crisis 

and the subsequent pace of healing.   

Let me offer an example of how these issues shape policy.  Four years ago, in 

April 2010, the outlook appeared fairly bright.  The emergency lending programs that the

Implications for Monetary Policy:  A Phillips Curve Retrospective (Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press).  
Moreover, with the share of long-term unemployed in total unemployment unusually elevated in recent 
years, there is an ongoing discussion about whether short- and long-term unemployment have differential 
effects on inflation.  See Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is Alive and Well:  Inflation and the

Federal Reserve implemented at the height of the crisis had been largely wound down, 

and the Fed was soon to complete its first large-scale asset purchase program. Private-

sector forecasters polled in the April 2010 Blue Chip survey were predicting that the 

unemployment rate would fall steadily to 8.6 percent in the final quarter of 2011.11   

This forecast proved quite accurate--the unemployment rate averaged 8.6 percent 

in the fourth quarter of 2011.  But this was not the whole story.  In April 2010, Blue Chip 

forecasters not only expected falling unemployment, they also expected the FOMC to 

soon begin raising the federal funds rate.  Indeed, they expected the federal funds rate to 

reach 1.3 percent by the second quarter of 2011.12  By July 2010, however, with growth 

disappointing and the FOMC expressing concerns about softening in both growth and 

inflation, the Blue Chip forecast of the federal funds rate in mid-2011 had fallen to 

0.8 percent, and by October the forecasters expected that the rate would remain in the 

range of 0 to 25 basis points throughout 2011, as turned out to be the case.13  Not only 

did expectations of policy tightening recede, the FOMC also initiated a new $600 billion 

asset purchase program in November 2010. 

                                                 
11 See Aspen Publishers (2010), Blue Chip Economic Indicators, vol. 35, no. 4 (April 10).  These forecasts 
were similar to the central tendency of FOMC participants’ projections for the unemployment rate at the 
end of 2011 submitted in conjunction with the April 2010 FOMC meeting, which ranged from 8.1 to 
8.5 percent.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “Minutes of the Federal Open 
Market Committee, April 27-28, 2010,” press release, May 19,

Aspen Publishers (2010), vol. 29, no. 10 (October 1).  In the statement following its August 10, 2010, 
meeting, the FOMC noted that “the pace of recovery in output and employment has slowed in recent 
months.”  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2010), “FOMC Statement,” press 
release, August 10, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100810a.htm.  See also the

Thus, while the reductions in the unemployment rate through 2011 were roughly 

as forecast in early 2010, this improvement only came about with the FOMC providing a 

considerably higher level of accommodation than originally anticipated.   

This experience was essentially repeated the following year.  In April 2011, Blue 

Chip forecasters expected the unemployment rate to fall to 7.9 percent by the fourth 

quarter of 2012, with the FOMC expected to have already raised the federal funds rate to 

near 1 percent by mid-2012.14   

As it turned out, the unemployment rate forecast was once more remarkably 

accurate, but again this was associated with considerably more accommodation than 

anticipated.  In response to signs of slowing economic activity, in August 2011 the 

FOMC for the first time expressed its forward guidance in terms of the calendar, stating 

that conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at 

least through mid-2013. The following month, the Committee added to accommodation 

by adopting a new balance sheet policy known as the maturity extension program. 15  

Thus, in both 2011 and 2012, the unemployment rate actually declined by about 

as much as had been forecast the previous year, but only after unexpected weakness 

prompted additional accommodative steps by the Federal Reserve.  In both cases, I 

believe that the FOMC’s decision to respond to signs of weakness with significant 

additional accommodation played an important role in helping to keep the projected labor

market recovery on track.16  These episodes illustrate what I described earlier as a vital 

aspect of effective monetary policymaking:  monitor the economy for signs that events 

are unfolding in a materially different manner than expected and adjust policy in response 

in a systematic manner.  Now I will turn from the task of monitoring to the policy 

response. 

Policy Challenges in an Unprecedented Recovery 

Fundamental to modern thinking on central banking is the idea that monetary 

policy is more effective when the public better understands and anticipates how the 

central bank will respond to evolving economic conditions.  Specifically, it is important 

for the central bank to make clear how it will adjust its policy stance in response to 

unforeseen economic developments in a manner that reduces or blunts potentially 

harmful consequences.  If the public understands and expects policymakers to behave in 

this systematically stabilizing manner, it will tend to respond less to such developments.  

Monetary policy will thus have an “automatic stabilizer” effect that operates through 

private-sector expectations.  It is important to note that tying the response of policy to the 

economy necessarily makes the future course of the federal funds rate uncertain.  But by 

responding to changing circumstances, policy can be most effective at reducing 

uncertainty about the course of inflation and employment. 

Recall how this worked during the couple of decades before the crisis--a period 

sometimes known as the Great Moderation.  The FOMC’s main policy tool, the federal 

funds rate, was well above zero, leaving ample scope to respond to the modest shocks 

                                                 
16 There are a range of estimates on the effectiveness of these policies.  A review is provided in Ben S. 
Bernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at “The Changing 
Policy Landscape,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson 
Hole, Wyo., August 30-September 1, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20120831a.htm.

that buffeted the economy during that period.  Many studies confirmed that the 

appropriate response of policy to those shocks could be described with a fair degree of 

accuracy by a simple rule linking the federal funds rate to the shortfall or excess of 

employment and inflation relative to their desired values.17  The famous Taylor rule 

provides one such formula.18   

The idea that monetary policy should react in a systematic manner in order to 

blunt the effects of shocks has remained central in the FOMC’s policymaking during this 

recovery.  However, the application of this idea has been more challenging.  With the 

federal funds rate pinned near zero, the FOMC has been forced to rely on two less 

familiar policy tools--the first one being forward guidance regarding the future setting of 

the federal funds rate and the second being large-scale asset purchases.  There are no 

time-tested guidelines for how these tools should be adjusted in response to changes in 

the outlook.  As the episodes recounted earlier illustrate, the FOMC has continued to try 

to adjust its policy tools in a systematic manner in response to new information about the 

economy.  But because both the tools and the economic conditions have been unfamiliar, 

it has also been critical that the FOMC communicate how it expects to deploy its tools in 

response to material changes in the outlook.   

Let me review some important elements in the evolution of the FOMC’s 

communication framework.  When the FOMC initially began using its unconventional 

tools, policy communication was relatively simple.  In December 2008, for example, the 

                                                 
17 See the discussion in John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2011), “Simple and Robust Rules for 
Monetary Policy,” chap. 15 in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary 
Economics, vol. 3B (San Diego:  North-Holland), pp. 829-59.  (An April 2010 working paper version of 
this chapter is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco’s website at

Series on Public Policy, vol. 39 (December), pp. 195-214.

FOMC said it expected that conditions would warrant keeping the federal funds rate near 

zero for “some time.”  This period before the “liftoff” in the federal funds rate was 

described in increasingly specific, and (as it turned out) longer, periods over time--“some 

time” became “an extended period,” which was later changed to “mid-2013,” then “late 

2014,” then “mid-2015.”19  This fixed, calendar-based guidance had the virtue of 

simplicity, but it lacked the automatic stabilizer property of communication that would 

signal how and why the stance of policy and forward guidance might change as 

developments unfolded, and as we learned about the extent of the need for 

accommodation.   

More recently, the Federal Reserve, and I might add, other central banks around 

the world, have sought to incorporate this automatic stabilizer feature in their 

communications.20  In December 2012, the Committee reformulated its forward 

guidance, stating that it anticipated that the federal funds rate would remain near zero at 

least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6-1/2 percent, inflation over the 

period between one and two years ahead was projected to be no more than half a 
                                                 
19 The references to “some time,” “an extended period,” “mid-2013,” “late 2014,” and “mid-2015” 
appeared in the FOMC statements of, respectively, December 2008, March 2009, August 2011, January 
2012, and September 2012.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2008), “FOMC

www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetarypolicy/Pages/forwardguidance.aspx.  The European Central Bank 
recently linked its forward guidance more explicitly to its assessment of economic slack, as discussed in

Statement to the Press Conference (with Q&A),” European Central Bank, Frankfurt, March 6,

percentage point above the Committee’s objective, and longer-term inflation expectations 

continued to be well anchored.  This guidance emphasized to the public that it could 

count on a near-zero federal funds rate at least until substantial progress in the recovery 

had been achieved, however long that might take.  When these thresholds were 

announced, the unemployment rate was reported to be 7.7 percent, and the Committee 

projected that the 6-1/2 percent threshold would not be reached for another 2-1/2 years--

in mid-2015.  The Committee emphasized that these numerical criteria were not triggers 

for raising the federal funds rate, and Chairman Bernanke stated that, ultimately, any 

decision to begin removing accommodation would be based on a wide range of 

indicators.21   

Our communications about asset purchases have undergone a similar 

transformation. The initial asset purchase programs had fixed time and quantity limits, 

although those limits came with a proviso that they might be adjusted.  In the fall of 

2012, the FOMC launched its current purchase program, this time explicitly tying the 

course of the program to evolving economic conditions.  When the program began, the 

rate of purchases was $85 billion per month, and the Committee indicated that purchases 

would continue, providing that inflation remained well behaved, until there was a 

substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market.22 

Based on the cumulative progress toward maximum employment since the 

initiation of the program and the improvement in the outlook for the labor market, the 

FOMC began reducing the pace of asset purchases last December, stating that “[i]f

incoming information broadly supports the Committee’s expectation of ongoing 

improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-

term objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further 

measured steps at future meetings.”23  Purchases are currently proceeding at a pace of 

$55 billion per month.  Consistent with my theme today, however, the FOMC statement 

underscores that purchases are not on a preset course--the FOMC stands ready to adjust 

the pace of purchases as warranted should the outlook change materially.   

Recent Changes to the Forward Guidance 

At our most recent meeting in March, the FOMC reformulated its forward 

guidance for the federal funds rate.  While one of the main motivations for this change 

was that the unemployment rate might soon cross the 6-1/2 percent threshold, the new 

formulation is also well suited to help the FOMC explain policy adjustments that may 

arise in response to changes in the outlook.  I should note that the change in the forward 

guidance did not indicate a change in the Committee’s policy intentions, but instead was 

made to clarify the Committee’s thinking about policy as the economy continues to 

recover.  The new guidance provides a general description of the framework that the 

FOMC will apply in making decisions about the timing of liftoff.  Specifically, in 

determining how long to maintain the current target range of 0 to 25 basis points for the 

federal funds rate, “the Committee will assess progress, both realized and expected, 

toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.”24  In other 

words, the larger the shortfall of employment or inflation from their respective objectives,

and the slower the projected progress toward those objectives, the longer the current 

target range for the federal funds rate is likely to be maintained.  This approach 

underscores the continuing commitment of the FOMC to maintain the appropriate degree 

of accommodation to support the recovery.  The new guidance also reaffirms the 

FOMC’s view that decisions about liftoff should not be based on any one indicator, but 

that it will take into account a wide range of information on the labor market, inflation, 

and financial developments.  

Along with this general framework, the FOMC provided an assessment of what 

that framework implies for the likely path of policy under the baseline outlook.  At 

present, the Committee anticipates that economic and financial conditions will likely 

warrant maintaining the current range “for the federal funds rate for a considerable time 

after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run 

below the Committee’s 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation 

expectations remain well anchored.”25   

Finally, the Committee began explaining more fully how policy may operate in 

the period after liftoff, indicating its expectation that economic conditions may, for some 

time, warrant keeping short-term interest rates below levels the Committee views as 

likely to prove normal in the longer run.  FOMC participants have cited different reasons 

for this view, but many of the reasons involve persistent effects of the financial crisis and 

the possibility that the productive capacity of the economy will grow more slowly, at 

least for a time, than it did, on average, before the crisis.  The expectation that the 

achievement of our economic objectives will likely require low real interest rates for 

some time is again not confined to the United States but is shared broadly across many

advanced economies.26  Of course, this guidance is a forecast and will evolve as we gain 

further evidence about how the economy is operating in the wake of the crisis and 

ensuing recession. 

Conclusion 

In summary, the policy framework I have described reflects the FOMC’s 

commitment to systematically respond to unforeseen economic developments in order to 

promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability.   

 It is very welcome news that a return to these conditions has finally appeared in 

the medium-term outlook of many forecasters.  But it will be much better news when this 

objective is reached.  My colleagues on the FOMC and I will stay focused on doing the 

Federal Reserve’s part to promote this goal.
