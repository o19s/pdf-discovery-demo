This is a momentous time.  During the past two and a half years, our nation has 

endured the worst global financial crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis that in turn 

helped cause a deep recession both here and abroad.  During some of the worst phases of 

the crisis, a new depression seemed a real possibility. 

Fortunately, today the financial crisis looks to be mostly behind us, and the 

economy seems to have stabilized and is beginning to grow again.  But we are far from 

being out of the woods.  Many Americans are still grappling with unemployment or 

foreclosure, or both.  Cities and states are struggling to maintain essential services.  And, 

although much of the financial system is functioning more or less normally, bank lending 

remains very weak, threatening the ability of small businesses to finance expansion and 

new hiring. 

In my comments today, I will briefly describe the origins of the financial crisis 

and economic downturn, with a particular focus on the policy response of my institution, 

the Federal Reserve.  I will then turn to some near-term and longer-term challenges 

facing our country. 

Origins of the Crisis 

The financial crisis that began in the summer of 2007 was an extraordinarily 

complex event with multiple causes.  Its immediate trigger was a downturn in the 

national housing market that followed a long period of rapid construction and rising 

home prices.  The housing slump in turn brought to light some very poor lending 

practices, especially for subprime mortgages extended to less-creditworthy borrowers.  

Relative to the global financial system, the market for subprime mortgages was quite 

small, probably less than 1 percent of global financial assets.  How, then, did problems in 


- 2 - 
 

this market appear to have such widespread consequences?  One important reason is that 

the subprime mortgage market was closely linked to a broader framework for credit 

provision that came to be known as the shadow banking system.  That broader 

framework, at least as it was structured during the run-up to the crisis, proved deeply 

flawed. 

The innovation underlying the shadow banking system was that it helped provide 

a wide range of borrowers indirect access to global credit markets.  For example, 

originators of subprime mortgages did not typically retain the loans they made on their 

own books.  Instead, the mortgages were packaged together in complex ways, sometimes 

with other types of loans, stamped with a seal of approval from one or more credit rating 

agencies, and sold to investors worldwide, thus--it was thought--broadly dispersing the 

underlying risks.  Credit risks were further dispersed--again, at least in theory--through 

the use of derivative financial instruments such as credit default swaps.  Importantly, 

residential mortgage markets were not the only markets caught up in the boom.  In part 

because large flows of capital into the United States drove down the returns available on 

many traditional long-term investments, such as Treasury bonds, investors’ appetite for 

alternative investments--such as loans to finance corporate mergers or commercial real 

estate projects--increased greatly in the years leading up to the crisis.  These securities 

too were packaged and sold through the shadow banking system.  

As we now know, however, neither the investors, nor the rating agencies, nor the 

regulators, nor even the firms that designed the securities fully appreciated the risks that 

those securities entailed.  Nor were the risks as widely dispersed as thought:  For 

example, many complex securities were held in off-balance-sheet vehicles financed by 


- 3 - 
 

short-term loans.  When investors lost confidence in the underlying securities and pulled 

their funding, many firms that sponsored the off-balance sheet vehicles found that they 

were bound by explicit or implicit promises to stand behind the securities.  Together with 

other direct or indirect exposures to risky debt, these commitments left financial 

institutions dangerously exposed to rising losses.   

These risks grew rapidly in the period before the crisis, in part because the 

regulators--like most financial firms and investors--did not fully understand or appreciate 

them.  But significant gaps in the regulatory framework itself also contributed to the 

inadequate government response.  For example, firms like the insurance giant American 

International Group (AIG), which sold credit insurance on large quantities of risky 

securities, or the investment bank Lehman Brothers, which speculated heavily in these 

securities, were not subject by law to strong consolidated supervision by federal 

regulators.  Moreover, none of the federal regulators had a mandate or sufficient powers 

to evaluate and respond to the risks posed by large financial organizations to the financial 

system as a whole. 

Thus, the stage was set for the unraveling that began in the summer of 2007 and 

continued throughout 2008.  As house prices and the equity of homeowners fell, 

mortgage delinquencies and defaults soared.  As I mentioned, investors--stunned by the 

resulting losses on mortgage-backed securities and other credit instruments they had 

believed to be safe--pulled back from a wide range of credit markets and financial 

institutions.  As funding dried up, losses mounted, and confidence plummeted, a number 

of major financial firms, both here and abroad, came under severe pressure.  In March 

2008, the investment house Bear Stearns became the first major firm to come to the brink 


- 4 - 
 

of failure, nearly collapsing before being purchased, with government assistance, by 

JPMorgan Chase.  In August, the two largest players in the housing market, the 

government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were taken into 

conservatorship.  In September, the sharply intensifying panic hit the investment bank 

Lehman Brothers, and soon after, AIG.  Much as in a traditional run on a bank, the 

creditors and counterparties of these companies raced to call in loans or demand extra 

collateral, ratcheting up the pressure on already shaky firms.  Concerted government 

attempts to find a buyer for Lehman proved unavailing; lacking sufficient collateral to 

secure a Federal Reserve loan, the company’s only option was bankruptcy.   

In contrast to Lehman, AIG had sufficient assets to secure credit from the Federal 

Reserve and thus avoid imminent failure.  I have said before that nothing made me 

angrier during the crisis than the irresponsible decisions at AIG that put our entire 

financial system and economy at grave risk and left the government with no good 

options.  However, with the financial system already teetering on the brink of collapse, 

the disorderly failure of AIG, the world’s largest insurance company, would have 

undoubtedly led to even greater financial chaos and a far deeper economic slump than the 

very severe one we have experienced.  

The rapidly worsening crisis soon spread beyond financial institutions into the 

money and capital markets more generally.  Losses on Lehman’s commercial paper at a 

prominent money market mutual fund led to a run on that fund and many others; over the 

subsequent weeks, fearful money-fund investors withdrew more than $400 billion.  

Equity prices fell precipitously, large firms and banks hoarded cash, and short-term credit 

became available, if at all, only at very high interest rates and for very short terms. 


- 5 - 
 

 As we now know, the financial turmoil dealt an economic body blow that spread 

worldwide.  Businesses slashed production and payrolls, including in countries that had 

not thus far experienced much effect.  International trade collapsed, and many nations 

dependent on trade experienced even sharper slides in economic activity than the United 

States.  

The Federal Reserve’s Policy Response 

As the crisis became global, the policy response became global as well.  After 

watershed meetings in Washington of finance ministers and central bank governors on 

October 10-11, 2008, many countries, including the United States, announced 

comprehensive plans to stabilize their banking systems.  They expanded deposit 

insurance, injected public capital into banks, guaranteed bank-issued debt, and increased 

access to funding from central banks.1  This strong and unprecedented response--a sharp 

contrast to the failures of international cooperation that helped make the depression of the 

1930s so devastating--proved broadly effective.  During the subsequent months the risk 

of a global financial meltdown and economic collapse receded. 

In support of these efforts to stabilize the financial system, and in its traditional 

central bank role as backstop liquidity provider, the Federal Reserve developed 

innovative programs to provide well-collateralized, mostly short-term credit to the 

financial system.  Without this credit, otherwise sound financial institutions could have 

been forced to dump assets onto the market, further depressing prices, or even been 

driven into failure, intensifying the crisis.  We provided this liquidity through a number 

of channels.  To help stabilize banks of all sizes, we eased the terms of lending to banks 

                                           
1 In addition, a number of foreign governments--including the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, 
Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Iceland--took steps to prevent the disorderly failures 
of distressed financial firms.   


- 6 - 
 

through our regular short-term lending facility, known as the discount window, and 

auctioned fixed quantities of discount window credit.  We also expanded access to our 

short-term lending to many securities firms, whose normal funding sources had been 

disrupted by the crisis.  And we worked closely with the Treasury to develop programs 

that successfully ended the run on the money market mutual funds.   

The Federal Reserve also acted to help restore normal functioning in key financial 

markets.  We established a backstop commercial paper facility to help address severe 

strains in the commercial paper market, on which many firms rely to finance their 

operations.  To improve the availability of credit more broadly, we created a facility to 

support the issuance of securities backed by a range of assets including small business 

loans, auto loans, credit card receivables, student loans, and commercial real estate.  

Additionally, after heavy foreign demand for dollar funding began to disrupt money 

markets and squeeze credit availability in the United States, we established cooperative 

programs with 14 foreign central banks to allow them to provide sufficient dollar funding 

to help calm markets in their own jurisdictions.  Importantly, these programs--most of 

which have been deemed no longer necessary and shut down--not only helped stabilize 

financial conditions and restart the flow of credit to American families and businesses, 

they did so at no financial cost to taxpayers and with no credit losses. 

Beyond its actions to help stabilize the financial system, the Federal Reserve also 

responded to the deepening recession with an aggressive monetary policy, in both 

conventional and less conventional forms.  We lowered interest rates sharply, including, 

in October 2008, an unprecedented coordinated rate cut with five other major central 

banks.  For the past 15 months, we have maintained our target short-term interest rate 


- 7 - 
 

near zero.  In a less conventional operation, we also purchased more than $1.7 trillion of 

Treasury securities and securities issued or guaranteed by the housing-related GSEs.  

These purchases contributed to a marked improvement in credit markets.  In particular, 

they significantly lowered mortgage interest rates, which made housing more affordable 

and allowed millions of Americans to reduce their payments by refinancing.   

Finally, the Federal Reserve also responded to the crisis in its capacity as a bank 

supervisor.  Last spring we led a forward-looking, simultaneous evaluation of the 

financial conditions and capital positions of 19 of the largest bank holding companies in 

the United States, with the Treasury committing to provide public capital as needed.  The 

goal of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program--popularly called the stress test--

was to ensure that these firms held sufficient capital, in both quantity and quality, to 

withstand worse-than-expected economic conditions over the subsequent two years and 

yet remain healthy and capable of lending to creditworthy borrowers.2  This exercise was 

unprecedented in scale and scope, as well as in the range of information we made public 

regarding the projected losses and revenues of the tested firms, which allowed private 

analysts to judge for themselves the credibility of the exercise.  Markets responded 

favorably to the release of the stress test results, and many of the tested banks were able 

to raise substantial amounts of capital from investors and to repay government capital. 

Overall, the policy actions implemented over the past two and a half years by the 

Federal Reserve and other agencies in the United States and abroad have helped stabilize

key global financial markets:  Short-term funding markets are essentially back to normal, 

corporate bond issuance has been strong, and stock prices have partially recovered.  Bank 

lending remains constrained, as I will discuss in a moment, but critically, fears of 

financial collapse have lessened substantially.  Most important, the economy has 

stabilized and is growing again, although we can hardly be satisfied when 1 out of every 

10 U.S. workers is unemployed and family finances remain under great stress. 

Toward Better Financial Regulation and Supervision 

As I noted earlier, we found some of the choices that we faced during the 

financial crisis exceedingly distasteful.  The Federal Reserve has always recognized the 

importance of allowing markets to work, and government oversight of financial firms 

will never be fully effective without the aid of strong market discipline.  The decisions 

we took, in collaboration with the Treasury, to assist distressed firms during the height of 

the crisis thus ran strongly against the grain of our institution.  However, as I said, our 

options under extremely difficult circumstances were bad and worse, as our ability to 

respond effectively was sharply limited by the lack of tools available to act in a crisis.  In 

particular, the U.S. government lacked any workable means to address the potential 

disorderly failure of a large, systemically important firm in a way that protected the 

economy and taxpayers from severe collateral damage.   

With the crisis largely behind us, we as a country must now turn to fixing 

structural weaknesses in the financial system, in particular in the regulatory framework.  

We need tough new rules to make financial institutions safer and to constrain excessive 

risk-taking, and we need a regulatory framework that gives the Federal Reserve and other 

agencies the ability to address risks to the financial system as a whole.  Critically, so that 


- 9 - 
 

we will never again face the unpalatable choice between bailouts and a disorderly 

bankruptcy that threatens to bring down our financial system, we must bring an end to the 

belief that some financial institutions are too big to fail.  To do that, we urgently need a 

new resolution regime for large, complex, and interconnected financial firms, similar to 

that already established for banks.  To end too-big-to-fail, the new regime should permit 

regulators to close a failing firm and impose losses on shareholders and creditors; indeed, 

I would argue that no financial instrument counted as regulatory capital should be 

allowed to receive any protection from losses.  At the same time, regulators must have 

the tools necessary to minimize the associated disruption to the financial system and the 

broader economy.3   

The Federal Reserve strongly supports ongoing congressional efforts to reform 

our financial regulatory framework, but we are not waiting for new legislation to make 

improvements.  We have been working hard to strengthen our own oversight of financial 

institutions and to broaden our field of vision to include potential risks to the financial 

system as a whole as well as risks to individual firms.  For example, we have played a 

key part in ongoing international efforts to ensure that systemically critical financial 

institutions hold more and higher-quality capital and have sufficient liquid assets on hand 

to be able to survive a market crisis.  And we are leading the international and domestic 

initiative to push banking organizations of all sizes to ensure their compensation practices 

link pay to performance and do not encourage excessive risk-taking. 

To make our supervision more effective and better able to identify risks to the 

financial system as a whole, we are also making fundamental changes to our daily 

                                           
3 Because most large financial firms are multinational, the development of an effective regime will require 
consultation and collaboration with authorities abroad.

operations.  For example, we have adopted a more multidisciplinary approach that makes 

better use of the wide range of expertise and skills at the Federal Reserve--in economics, 

financial markets, payments systems, and other specialties, as well as bank supervision.  

We will be doing more cross-firm comparisons to better understand differences in the 

practices of different firms and the risks they face, and we will be complementing on-site 

examinations with off-site, quantitative analyses by experts in a range of disciplines.  As 

we improve our supervision, we will be sure not to lose sight of the diversity of our 

banking system.  Banks of all sizes, including regional and community banks, make 

critical contributions to our economy; thus, we must continue our efforts to ensure the 

stability and vitality of smaller banks as well as larger ones. 

As we’ve been working to make our supervision more effective, we have also 

been taking care to ensure we do not inadvertently impede sound lending.  Businesses 

need access to credit to maintain or expand their payrolls and make productive 

investments.  Banks need to continue to lend to creditworthy borrowers to earn a profit 

and remain strong.  If bankers become overly conservative in response to past lending 

mistakes--or if examiners force such behavior--it will hurt bankers’ own long-term 

interests and the economy in general.  For this reason, we have joined with the other 

federal banking agencies to issue a series of policy statements to examiners: on the 

importance of bank lending to creditworthy borrowers, on small business lending, and on 

commercial real estate loan restructuring.4  We have followed up this formal guidance

Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of

with training for examiners and outreach to the banking industry.  Our message is a 

simple one:  Institutions should strive to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, and 

the supervisory agencies should do all they can to help, not hinder, those efforts.  We also 

must support sensible efforts to work with troubled borrowers to bring them back into 

good standing.  To help us better understand what is going on in the banks we supervise 

and in the communities they serve, we continue to seek many views.  For example, our 

Reserve Banks across the country are holding meetings with community bankers and 

others to talk about opportunities for and barriers to small business lending.  

Additionally, the Federal Reserve continues to demonstrate its commitment to 

consumer protection in financial services.  We have recently overhauled the regulations 

governing mortgage transactions and implemented enhanced protections for credit card 

accounts and private student loans.  We also have made new rules for overdraft 

protection programs and for gift cards.  In addition, we have expanded our compliance 

program for enforcing consumer protection rules at nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding 

companies and foreign banking organizations. 

In these and other areas, we at the Federal Reserve will continue to improve 

how we regulate and supervise financial firms while continuing to do all in our power 

to identify and mitigate risks that may endanger the financial system as a whole.

Economic Challenges 

  Notwithstanding the progress that I’ve noted, critical challenges--both near term 

and longer term--remain.  We have yet to see evidence of a sustained recovery in the 

housing market.  Mortgage delinquencies for both subprime and prime loans continue 

to rise as do foreclosures.  The commercial real estate sector remains troubled, which is 

a concern for communities and for banks holding commercial real estate loans. 

Some of the toughest problems are in the job market.  The unemployment rate 

has edged off its recent peak, but at 9.7 percent, it is still close to its highest level since 

the early 1980s.  Although layoffs have eased in recent months, hiring remains very 

weak.  More than 40 percent of the unemployed have been out of work six months or 

longer, nearly double the share of a year ago.  I am particularly concerned about that 

statistic, because long spells of unemployment erode skills and lower the longer-term 

income and employment prospects of these workers. 

That said, my best guess is that economic growth, supported by the Federal 

Reserve’s stimulative monetary policy, will be sufficient to slowly reduce the 

unemployment rate over the coming year.  If economic conditions improve, as I expect, 

we should see increased optimism among consumers and greater willingness on the part 

of banks to lend, which in turn should aid the recovery.  Meanwhile, for the near term, 

inflation appears to be well controlled.  Productivity improvements have helped firms 

control costs, and little pricing power is evident.  Inflation expectations, as measured in 

the financial markets or in surveys, appear stable.  


- 13 - 
 

What about the longer term?  The economist John Maynard Keynes said that in 

the long run, we are all dead.5  If he were around today he might say that, in the long 

run, we are all on Social Security and Medicare.  That brings me to two interrelated 

economic challenges our nation faces:  meeting the economic needs of an aging 

population and regaining fiscal sustainability.  The U.S. population will change 

significantly in coming decades with the combined effect of the decline in fertility rates 

following the baby boom and increasing longevity.  As our population ages, the ratio of 

working-age Americans to older Americans will fall, which could hold back the long-

run prospects for living standards in our country.  The aging of the population also will 

have a major impact on the federal budget, most dramatically on the Social Security and 

Medicare programs, particularly if the cost of health care continues to rise at its 

historical rate.  Thus, we must begin now to prepare for this coming demographic 

transition.6 

The economist Herb Stein once famously said, “If something cannot go on 

forever, it will stop.”7  That adage certainly applies to our nation’s fiscal situation.  

Inevitably, addressing the fiscal challenges posed by an aging population will require a 

willingness to make difficult choices.  The arithmetic is, unfortunately, quite clear.  To 

avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose 

among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and

Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some 

combination of the above.  These choices are difficult, and it always seems easier to put 

them off--until the day they cannot be put off any more.  But unless we as a nation 

demonstrate a strong commitment to fiscal responsibility, in the longer run we will have 

neither financial stability nor healthy economic growth. 

Today the economy continues to operate well below its potential, which implies 

that a sharp near-term reduction in our fiscal deficit is probably neither practical nor 

advisable.  However, nothing prevents us from beginning now to develop a credible 

plan for meeting our long-run fiscal challenges.  Indeed, a credible plan that 

demonstrated a commitment to achieving long-run fiscal sustainability could lead to 

lower interest rates and more rapid growth in the near term. 

Our economic challenges, both near term and longer term, are daunting indeed.  

Nonetheless, I remain optimistic that they can be met.  History has demonstrated time 

and again the inherent resilience and recuperative powers of the American economy.  

Our country’s competitive, market-based system, its flexible capital and labor markets, 

its tradition of entrepreneurship, and its knack for innovation have ensured that the 

nation’s economy has surmounted difficult challenges in the past.  I do not doubt that 

we can do so once again.
