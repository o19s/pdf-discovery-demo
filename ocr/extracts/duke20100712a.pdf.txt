July 12, 2010 





Good afternoon.  I want to thank all of you for participating in today’s discussion 

about the financing needs of small businesses. I particularly want to thank Karen Mills, 

the Small Business Administration (SBA) Administrator, for her remarks and our 

distinguished panelists for helping us to better understand the dynamics of small business 

lending in these difficult economic times.  I would also like to thank everyone who 

participated in the more than 40 regional meetings that led up to today’s conference and 

to thank the Reserve Banks for their sponsorship and organization of those meetings.  

They brought together small businesses, lenders, technical assistance providers, bank 

examiners and others involved in small business credit to help identify barriers to small 

business credit access and to suggest potential solutions.   

As many of you know, I came to the Federal Reserve after many years as a 

community banker.  Quite a number of those years were spent lending to the small 

businesses that were the backbone of my local economy.  That experience gives me a 

deep appreciation for the importance of credit to economic growth and the particular 

importance of small business lending to job creation in local communities.  So, as you 

might imagine, the recent decline in availability of credit to small businesses concerns 

me.  It also concerns my colleagues across the Federal Reserve System.   

When the mortgage crisis first broke a few years ago, we were able to build a 

body of data and an understanding of relevant issues through a series of meetings 

convened by the Federal Reserve Banks across the country on topics such as foreclosure 

or neighborhood stabilization.  As we started hearing more about problems encountered 

by small businesses in accessing credit, we again tapped the broad footprint of the 

Reserve Bank system and the web of local contacts they have developed to help us better

understand the issues surrounding loans to small business.  I attended one of the regional 

meetings in June and was pleased to see firsthand the quality of the conversation that 

took place.  Today we have seen evidence that the conversations were equally rich across 

the country.  The information gathered through this kind of outreach is invaluable as we 

consider our policy options, and I hope that you have found it similarly helpful.   

Today’s agenda was organized around the common issues identified in those 

regional meetings.  We looked at small business credit issues from the perspective of the 

private, public, and nonprofit sectors.  We also looked at the implications of data and 

information gaps on our understanding of the dynamics of small business lending.  And, 

perhaps most important, we identified some promising next steps to ensure that 

creditworthy small businesses have the access to capital that they need.       

Today’s meeting has been referred to as a capstone because it summarized the 

information we gathered.  But our conversation today makes it clear that this is just the 

beginning.  There is no single step that can be taken to cure what is ailing the small 

business lending market.  As we have heard, the causes for credit tightening are many 

and complex.  Equally numerous are the challenges facing small businesses and limiting 

their demand for credit.  These issues have evolved over time, and it only makes sense 

that implementing solutions will be equally difficult and will take time.  This has been a 

full day and I want to commend you for your stamina, your insights, and your 

commitment to helping us identify those next steps that all of us--public policymakers, 

small business lenders, nonprofits, and small business owners--can take to facilitate small 

businesses’ access to credit.  I hope we can also count on you to continue the effort, for it

will take all of us working together to fully restore a healthy credit environment for the 

small businesses that are so important to our economy. 

As we think about taking the next steps, I would like to especially note the 

success of the Federal Reserve’s small business meeting series in fostering collaboration 

among numerous federal agencies, including the other financial regulatory agencies, the 

Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) Fund, and the Small 

Business Administration.  Collaboration will continue to be the key to crafting solutions 

to small business financing issues, both in Washington and in the field.  Today we 

identified several areas where we can work together to improve the lending conditions for 

small businesses. 

Before we adjourn, let me briefly review what we heard today. 

Private Sector Solutions 

We consistently heard about the impact of credit tightening and banks’ ability and 

willingness to lend to small businesses.  If we assume, as I do, that bankers are 

predisposed to lending, because without lending there can be no profit, then it is 

important to understand what stands in the way of lending to small businesses.  Some 

banks are limited in their ability to lend due to weaknesses in their balance sheet, such as 

low capital or liquidity.  Others might have the balance sheet capacity to lend but are 

restricted in some loan categories due to problems or concentrations in their own loan 

portfolios.  Because small business lending relationships are built through repeated 

interactions over time, customers of weakened institutions may find their available credit 

under existing relationships reduced and have trouble replicating those relationships with 

a new bank.  In addition, a number of small businesses are feeling the effects of tightened 


 - 4 -

credit because the value of their collateral has dropped.  Businesses that have maintained 

strong cash flows through the recession are particularly concerned about the potential for 

devalued collateral to reduce their credit access and, in some cases, to create an additional 

strain on balance sheets as cash and other assets are required to shore up collateral 

positions that no longer meet underwriting standards.  In addition, small businesses and 

banks alike attribute a significant portion of the tightened credit environment to 

regulatory uncertainty and, in particular, to concern about the classification of assets by 

bank examiners.   

I do not believe it is appropriate or even possible for regulators to urge banks to 

make loans that are outside their risk tolerance or that would be unsafe or unsound.  But 

we can and should be sure that supervisory policies do not impede the flow of credit to all 

eligible borrowers.  That’s why the Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies have 

worked so hard during the past few years to ensure that while banks appropriately 

recognize loan problems they also can continue to make loans that are safe and sound.  

The financial regulators have issued guidance to provide clarity and consistency 

regarding the supervisory treatment of new loans, problem loans, and different loan 

workout approaches because we understand how important regulatory certainty is to 

bankers, who must make decisions about whether and to whom they should lend.  The 

interagency guidance stressed the importance of continuing to make prudent loans to 

creditworthy customers;1 clarified standards for commercial real estate (CRE) loans and

Statement on Meeting the Needs of Creditworthy Borrowers," press release, November 12.

workouts;2 and, most recently, restated supervisory views on lending to small 

businesses.3  

At the Federal Reserve, we have complemented the guidance with training 

programs for examiners and outreach to the banking industry that underscores the 

importance of sound lending practices.  In January, Federal Reserve staff instituted a 

Systemwide examiner training initiative that is reaching Federal Reserve and state 

examiners all across the United States.  In addition, in May more than 1,400 bankers and 

state bank commissioners from across the country participated in an “Ask the Fed” 

conference call to discuss CRE-related issues, such as credit workouts and troubled debt 

restructurings.  The session was an effective way to help clarify the guidance and allowed 

us to hear more about concerns of people in the industry.       

But we are not finished. The Federal Reserve is also working to develop better 

ways to measure the effectiveness of the lending guidance we have issued.  After all, if 

these sorts of issuances don’t work, we need to know that so we can figure out a better 

way to get our messages across.  For example, before issuing the CRE guidance last year, 

Federal Reserve staff surveyed examiners to gain a better understanding of the banks’ 

workout practices.  That information is serving as a baseline for assessing the impact of 

the supervisory guidance.  We are asking examiners to capture, where possible, 

information on troubled debt restructurings and other types of loan workouts and 

dispositions as part of the ongoing examination process.  We are also exploring the

feasibility of more-formal statistical approaches for measuring and evaluating the 

effectiveness of the CRE workout and restructuring policy statement.   

An encouraging sign of banks’ responsiveness to borrowers’ concerns was the 

discussion in several meetings about the importance of second look programs.  Some 

lenders have robust second look programs to ensure that applications for small business 

credit receive appropriate consideration.  These programs are particularly helpful at a 

time when traditional underwriting standards, such as reviewing three years’ worth of 

financial statements, may not be as reliable an indicator as they were before the recession.  

Similarly, in the meeting I attended in Tampa, there was a lively give and take between 

borrowers and lenders about permitting borrowers to talk directly to underwriters so 

borrowers can understand the reasoning behind credit decisions and perhaps offer 

additional information or explanation. 

Public and Nonprofit Sector Solutions 

Part of the ongoing debate about whether we have a supply or demand problem 

with small business lending is based on the fact that bankers and small business owners 

have different ideas about what a creditworthy small business looks like.  We heard a lot 

of discussion from bankers and small business owners about the need for technical 

assistance to help businesses understand and prepare the documentation necessary to 

obtain credit.  Business owners might require technical assistance to help them repair 

their credit, rethink their cash flow structures, develop business plans, or just present their 

information in a more organized way.  In addition, many technical assistance providers, 

such as small business development centers, can help businesses tap into non-bank 

sources of credit or better utilize available trade credit.  We found that many banks and 


 - 7 -

small businesses were unaware of the assistance that nonprofit technical assistance 

providers could offer in such cases.  The demand for technical assistance is most acute 

among start-up businesses, but it continues to be important for businesses that are trying 

to grow.   

Small businesses voiced their concern over the dearth of products suited to their 

specific credit needs, particularly small-dollar loans.  We heard that many financial 

institutions have reduced or curtailed small-dollar loans altogether because of the time 

and resources required to make them.  CDFIs and some community banks and credit 

unions are uniquely situated to provide small-dollar loans and other products tailored to 

small business customers, but funding, capacity, and certain regulatory constraints have 

hindered their ability to fully meet the demand for these loans.  Several ideas to help 

CDFIs, community banks, and credit unions meet the increased demand for small 

business loans were discussed today, and we are committed to following up on them.   

CDFIs are especially useful to small businesses for loans that many traditional 

creditors view as too risky or too small to be profitable.  Moreover, CDFIs complement 

their lending products with training and technical assistance for their customers, either 

directly or through partnerships with nonprofit organizations.  This combination enhances 

a borrower’s capacity and mitigates the risks of default.  Successful borrowers often 

graduate to conventional financing as their needs grow, freeing up resources to help new 

businesses. 

Much of our outreach at the Federal Reserve has focused on the particular needs 

of minority small businesses.  While all small businesses are vulnerable to economic 

downturns, this recession has hit minority small businesses particularly hard.  At our 


 - 8 -

meetings, we heard a number of comments citing a comparative lack of capitalization, 

weaker collateral values, and lower credit scores for many minority small businesses, 

which leave these firms with less ability to absorb economic shocks.  For example, in Los 

Angeles, we heard that the decline in residential property values has had a significantly 

adverse impact on businesses owned by Asian Pacific Islanders who relied heavily on 

home equity for financing.  We heard about the same issue with respect to many African 

American- and Hispanic-owned businesses around the country.  In other cases where 

efforts such as government procurement programs were instituted to help minority small 

businesses, we heard that the inability to secure credit to fulfill contracts makes these 

programs out of reach for many potential participants.  It is also clear that minority-

owned businesses would benefit from improved access to technical assistance and 

resources such as training in financial management, mentoring, and assistance with loan 

documentation that may not be in a business owner’s native language.  But there are also 

hopeful examples of successful collaboration to address these issues.  While in 

Minneapolis, I toured the Midtown Global Market, a multicultural marketplace that 

serves as an inspirational reminder of what can be accomplished when public and private 

resources combine to support minority businesses.     

Research and Data Improvements 

Finally, we spent some time today discussing the need for better data and analysis 

to monitor and understand small business credit flows.  As a research institution, the 

Federal Reserve is always looking for opportunities to improve data, and we already have 

taken a number of steps in this direction.  First, while banks do not report loans to small 

businesses separately, they do report information on business loans less than $1 million 


 - 9 -

and farm loans less than $500,000.  The history of this data can be used as a proxy for 

small business lending.   So in order to monitor lending to small business more closely, 

beginning with the first quarter of 2010, we have increased the frequency of this Call 

Report requirement from an annual to a quarterly basis.  Second, researchers from around 

the Federal Reserve System will gather at the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis later 

this summer to compare notes on the research currently being conducted in the area of 

small business financing, identify any gaps, and develop ideas for future areas of inquiry.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve Banks of Atlanta and Dallas have partnered with the 

Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation to co-host a research conference, Small Business, 

Entrepreneurship, and Economic Recovery: A Focus on Job Creation and Economic 

Stabilization, which will take place October 26 and 27 in Atlanta.   Through paper 

presentations and policy roundtables, the conference will help us gain a better 

understanding of the implications of various existing, new, and proposed policies related 

to small business and entrepreneurship, including new and expanded SBA and CDFI 

programs.  Lastly, it is important to note that this meeting today and the regional 

meetings that led to it have introduced us to potential partners for furthering our research 

efforts in this area, and we look forward to expanding our horizons in this respect.   

Conclusion   

I wish I could conclude this wrap-up with a list of the three or four things we 

could do to immediately unlock small business lending.  But the problems are numerous 

and complex and they will require creativity and persistence to solve.  Just because the 

solutions are hard to find does not mean that we shouldn’t keep trying.  Finding solutions 

to small business financing issues is not only an important component of the economic 


 - 10 -

recovery, it is also important to the restoration of communities that have been hard-hit by 

foreclosures and job losses.  What we have accomplished is a good beginning.  We have 

identified some specific credit gaps and generated some ideas to tackle them.  We have 

brought together a network of people with different perspectives and resources but a 

shared commitment to improving credit conditions.  And we have sparked numerous 

research projects to further understanding of the current and ongoing credit needs of 

small businesses.  If we continue to work together, I am sure that we can alleviate some 

of the problems that small businesses face.  The more we do now, the better prepared our 

small businesses and lending institutions will be when economic growth and consumer 

demand pick up.  Thank you, again, for your participation today.
