Federal Reserve Meeting Series: 
“Addressing the Financing Needs of Small Businesses”

July 12, 2010 


 Let me begin by thanking the staff of the Board’s Division of Consumer and 

Community Affairs, especially the Division’s director Sandra Braunstein, for the hard 

work they have done to prepare for today’s discussion about improving access to credit 

for sound small businesses.  And thanks also to the many partners who helped us 

organize today’s event, particularly the Small Business Administration and the 

Treasury’s Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.  I am pleased to 

welcome all of you to the Federal Reserve Board.   

 This gathering, “Addressing the Financing Needs of Small Businesses,” serves as 

a capstone for a series of more than 40 meetings.  They were conducted across the 

country, starting in February, by the Federal Reserve System’s community affairs offices.  

These meetings provided forums for small business owners; trade associations; lenders; 

bank supervisors; federal, state, and local government officials; and other stakeholders to 

exchange ideas about the challenges facing small businesses, both in the near term and in 

the longer run.  

 Some of these meetings were small-group discussions, while others were larger 

sessions that addressed specific topics, such as minority entrepreneurship or guaranteed 

loan programs.  For example, I attended a meeting in Detroit that combined a general 

discussion of small business credit issues with a session focusing on the specific case of 

suppliers to the auto industry, many of which are small or medium-sized firms.  

Participants in that session highlighted the interconnectedness of the auto supply chain 

and the crucial role of stable financing for small businesses ranging from parts suppliers 

to independent automobile dealers in the recovery of the auto industry as a whole.  This 

was, of course, just one meeting in one city.  A meeting in Miami focused on the needs of

Hispanic-owned businesses.  Similarly informative discussions took place in cities such 

as New York, San Francisco, and Chicago, among many others, including Omaha, 

Nebraska; Morgantown, West Virginia; Toledo, Ohio; and Little Rock, Arkansas. 

 Our objective in organizing this series was to gather information that we and 

others can use to help develop policies that will support the flow of loans to creditworthy 

small businesses--for instance, by identifying and addressing specific credit gaps or 

impediments to lending or improving the access of small businesses to critical support 

services, including assistance in filing loan applications.  This information serves as the 

basis for today’s discussion of the next steps that policymakers and stakeholders can 

undertake to ensure that small businesses are able to participate in and contribute to the 

economic recovery.  

 Before we get to the next steps, however, I would like to provide context by 

briefly discussing the importance of small businesses to job creation and the economic 

recovery, reviewing the actions that the Federal Reserve has taken to support small 

business financing, and offering some observations about what we heard during this 

small business meeting series.  

 Small businesses are central to creating jobs in our economy; they employ 

roughly one-half of all Americans and account for about 60 percent of gross job 

creation.1  Newer small businesses, those less than two years old, are especially 

important:  Over the past 20 years, these start-up enterprises accounted for roughly one-

quarter of gross job creation even though they employed less than 10 percent of the 

workforce.2 

 The formation and growth of small businesses depends critically on access to 

credit.  Unfortunately, those businesses report that credit conditions remain very difficult.  

For example, the net percentage of survey respondents telling the National Federation of 

Independent Business that credit conditions have tightened over the prior three months 

has remained extremely elevated by historical standards.3  And one measure of banks’ 

loans to small businesses dropped from more than $710 billion in the second quarter of 

2008 to less than $670 billion in the first quarter of 2010.4  An important but difficult-to-

answer question is, How much of this reduction has been driven by weaker demand for 

loans from small businesses, how much by a deterioration in the financial condition of 

small businesses during the economic downturn, and how much by restricted credit 

availability?  No doubt all three factors have played a role.5  Clearly, though, to support 

the recovery, we need to find ways to ensure that creditworthy borrowers have access to 

needed loans. 

 Over the past two years, the Federal Reserve and other agencies have made a 

concerted effort to stabilize our financial system and our economy.  These efforts, 

importantly, have included working to facilitate the flow of credit to viable small

Condition and Income (Call Report), where loans to small businesses, as stated in the reporting forms 
FFIEC 031 and 041, schedule RC-C, part II, are defined as loans with original amounts of $1 million or 
less that are secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties or are commercial and industrial loans. 
Correction: On July 27, 2010, this footnote was revised to remove "plus loans with original balances of 
$500,000 or less that are secured by farmland or are for agricultural production."

businesses.  At the Federal Reserve, we helped bring capital from the securities markets 

to small businesses through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility--the TALF 

program.  More than 850,000 small business loans were financed in part by securities 

whose issuance was supported by TALF.  We have also been focused on strengthening 

the nation’s banks, so that they can resume normal lending as quickly as possible.  For 

example, the stress tests that we conducted last year helped restore confidence in the 

banking system, allowing banks to raise the capital they need to help offset credit losses 

and, ultimately, to provide the basis for new lending. 

 We have heard the often-expressed concern that bank examiners have prevented 

banks from making good loans.  We take this issue very seriously.  The Federal Reserve 

has worked assiduously with the other banking regulators to develop interagency policy 

statements on this issue, aimed at both banks and examiners.  Our message is clear:  

Consistent with maintaining appropriately prudent standards, lenders should do all they 

can to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers.6  Doing so is good for the borrower, 

good for the lender, and good for our economy.  To ensure that this message is being 

heard and acted upon, we have conducted extensive training programs for our bank 

examiners as well as outreach with bankers, and we will continue to seek feedback from 

bankers and borrowers. 

 Though we believe that our and others’ efforts are making a difference, we also 

know more must be done, and that additional effective action requires hearing firsthand 

from knowledgeable people who can speak from diverse perspectives about the

challenges facing small businesses.  The insights we obtained from small business 

owners, lenders, and others in this series of meetings have given us a more nuanced 

understanding of the problem and will help us identify areas where we might be able to 

do more.  Not surprisingly, these meetings confirmed that facilitating small business 

financing is not a simple or straightforward matter.  Notably, the term “small business” 

encompasses a heterogeneous mix of enterprises, ranging from pizzerias to start-up 

technology firms, and each small business faces a unique combination of local economic 

conditions and complex relationships with customers, suppliers, and creditors.  Hence we 

should be wary of one-size-fits-all solutions.  

 One of the most important themes underscored during the meetings is that solving 

the issues faced by small businesses will require collaboration.  The meeting series itself 

served as a model of collaboration, interactive discussion, and cooperative problem 

solving.  Participants included community affairs officers, bank supervisors, economists, 

and policymakers from the Federal Reserve.  We involved our fellow bank regulators, the 

Small Business Administration, and the Community Development Financial Institutions 

Fund.  And, of course, small businesses and lenders played a central role.  The meetings 

fostered stimulating conversations.  Lenders heard from small business owners about 

their frustrations over tightened credit.  Likewise, lenders were able to explain the 

considerations that go into making a small business loan.  And regulators heard, in detail, 

concerns expressed about the effect their procedures and guidance would have on small 

business lending.  

 Some common themes emerged from the sessions.  Business owners frequently 

noted that the declining value of real estate and other collateral securing their loans poses

a particularly severe challenge.  As one business owner at the Detroit meeting I attended 

put it, “If you thought housing had declined in value, take a look at what equipment is 

worth.”  Business owners cited credit lines and working capital as their most critical 

financial needs, followed by refinancing products that would permit them to take 

advantage of low interest rates.  Many reported having had to resort to borrowing through 

their personal credit cards or from their retirement accounts.  Several mentioned the need 

for small-value loans in amounts less than $200,000 as well as the need for “patient 

capital” from investors willing to commit funds for 5 to 10 years without an expectation 

of immediate returns.  

 Some of the lenders that participated in our meetings expressed the view that 

current lending conditions don’t represent credit tightening as much as a return to more 

traditional underwriting standards following a period of too-lax standards.  But, though 

some lenders said they were emphasizing cash flow and relying less on collateral values 

in evaluating creditworthiness, it seems clear that some creditworthy businesses--

including some whose collateral has lost value but whose cash flows remain strong--have 

had difficulty obtaining the credit that they need to expand, and in some cases, even to 

continue operating.  The challenge ahead for lenders will be to determine how to assess 

the credit quality of businesses in an uncertain and difficult economic environment.  It is 

in lenders’ interest, after all, to lend to creditworthy borrowers; ultimately, that’s how 

they earn their profits.  Regulators, for their part, need to continue to work with lenders to 

help them do all that they prudently can to meet the needs of creditworthy small 

businesses.  

 Making credit accessible to sound small businesses is crucial to our economic

recovery and so should be front and center among our current policy challenges.  We are 

pleased that you have accepted our invitation to participate in today’s discussion of next 

steps in the effort to promote small business finance.  You each bring valuable insights 

and perspectives to this issue, and I would like to thank you all for your willingness to 

share your ideas.
