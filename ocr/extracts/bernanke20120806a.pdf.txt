I appreciate the opportunity to speak at a conference with the important theme of 

economic measurement.  In many spheres of human endeavor, from science to business 

to education to economic policy, good decisions depend on good measurement.  More 

subtly, what we decide to measure, or are able to measure, has important effects on the 

choices we make, since it is natural to focus on those objectives for which we can best 

estimate and document the effects of our decisions.  One great pioneer in this subject 

area, of course, is Simon Kuznets, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971 for his work 

on economic measurement, including the national income accounts.  Over the years many 

economists have built on his work to further improve our ability to quantify aspects of 

economic activity and thus to improve economic policymaking and our understanding of 

how the economy works.  The remarkably broad and ambitious research program of this 

conference and the impressive expertise that has been assembled illustrate the continued 

vitality of this field.  Evolving technologies that allow economists to gather new types of 

data and to manipulate millions of data points are just one factor among several that are 

likely to transform the field in coming years. 

As we think about new directions for economic measurement, we might start by 

reminding ourselves of the purpose of economics.  Textbooks describe economics as the 

study of the allocation of scarce resources.  That definition may indeed be the “what,” but 

it certainly is not the “why.”  The ultimate purpose of economics, of course, is to 

understand and promote the enhancement of well-being.  Economic measurement 

accordingly must encompass measures of well-being and its determinants. 

In the tradition of national income accounting, economic policymakers have 

typically focused on variables such as income, wealth, and consumption.  The Federal

Reserve has a statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and price stability, 

which motivates our extensive efforts to monitor and forecast measures of employment 

and inflation.  Substantial research and the development of data collection infrastructures 

have, over the years, greatly enhanced our ability to receive timely and accurate measures 

of those variables.  Aggregate measures, such as gross domestic product and personal 

consumption expenditures, are useful for monitoring people’s ability to meet basic 

material needs and for tracking cyclical and secular changes in the economy as a whole.  

Indeed, the experience of the recent financial crisis and the ensuing recession was 

strongly reflected in nearly all of these aggregate measures, indicating the severe 

economic stress felt by millions of people and hundreds of communities across the 

country.  

But, as many of you will discuss this week, aggregate statistics can sometimes 

mask important information.  For example, even though some key aggregate 

metrics--including consumer spending, disposable income, household net worth, and debt 

service payments--have moved in the direction of recovery, it is clear that many 

individuals and households continue to struggle with difficult economic and financial 

conditions.  Exclusive attention to aggregate numbers is likely to paint an incomplete 

picture of what many individuals are experiencing.  One implication is that we should 

increase the attention paid to microeconomic data, which better capture the diversity of 

experience across households and firms.  Another implication, however, is that we should 

seek better and more-direct measurements of economic well-being, the ultimate objective 

of our policy decisions.

Although the field is still young, there have been interesting developments in the 

measurement of economic well-being.  In a commencement address two years ago titled 

“The Economics of Happiness,” I spoke about the concepts of happiness and life 

satisfaction from the perspective of economics and other social science research.1  

Following the growing literature, I define “happiness” as a short-term state of awareness 

that depends on a person’s perceptions of one’s immediate reality, as well as on 

immediate external circumstances and outcomes.  By “life satisfaction” I mean a longer-

term state of contentment and well-being that results from a person’s experiences over 

time.  Surveys and experimental studies have made progress in identifying the 

determinants of happiness and life satisfaction.  Interestingly, income and wealth do 

contribute to self-reported happiness, but the relationship is more complex and context-

dependent than standard utility theory would suggest.2  Other important contributors to 

individuals’ life satisfaction are a strong sense of support from belonging to a family or 

core group and a broader community, a sense of control over one’s life, a feeling of 

confidence or optimism about the future, and an ability to adapt to changing 

circumstances.  Indeed, an interesting finding in the literature is that the overwhelming 

majority of people in the United States and in many other countries report being very 

happy or pretty happy on a daily basis--a finding that researchers link to people’s intrinsic 

abilities to adapt and find satisfaction in their lives even in very difficult circumstances.3

2 Canonical models of economic decisionmaking presume individual maximization of “utility,” or well-
being.  They tend to focus on the consumption of goods or services and assume that more consumption is 
preferred to less.  For example, see Andrew Mas-Colell, Michael D. Whinston, and Jerry R Green (1995),

This line of research has generated alternative measures of well-being that are 

frequently survey-based and incorporate elements such as psychological wellness, the 

level of education, physical health and safety, community vitality and the strength of 

family and social ties, and time spent in leisure activities.  These measures have begun to 

inform official statistics and have started to be discussed in policy debates.  An 

interesting and unique case is the Kingdom of Bhutan, which abandoned tracking gross 

national product in 1972 in favor of its Gross National Happiness index based on a 

survey that incorporates these types of indicators.  Taking the measurement of well-being 

in a cross-country framework, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 

Development (OECD), as part of its OECD Better Life Initiative, has created a “better 

life index” that allows a side-by-side comparison of countries according to various 

quality-of-life indicators that could, at least in principle, be followed over time.4  Other 

somewhat-more-conventional economic indicators that bear on quality of life, and that 

accordingly might be developed and followed in more detail, include changes in the 

distribution of income, wealth, or consumption; the degree of upward mobility in material 

measures of well-being; indications of job security and confidence about future 

employment prospects; and households’ liquidity buffers or other measures of their 

ability to absorb financial shocks.  All of these indicators could be useful in measuring 

economic progress or setbacks as well as in explaining economic decisionmaking or 

projecting future economic outcomes.

Continued work on the measurement of economic well-being will likely lead to 

greater recognition by economists of the contributions of psychology--an area that has 

been explored by pioneers like 2002 Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman.  One topic on the 

frontier of economics and psychology is the neurological basis of human decisions, 

including decisionmaking under risk and uncertainty, intertemporal choice, and social 

decisionmaking.5  Researchers are investigating behavioral tendencies in a variety of 

circumstances--for instance, by examining human responses to perceived inequality, 

losses, risk, and uncertainty; the need for autonomy; and the importance for well-being of 

social ties and community.  For example, brain imaging research has documented 

differences in the brain regions that light up in response to losses and gains--a clear 

physical manifestation of the “loss aversion” documented in the earlier behavioral studies 

in economics and psychology.6  Evolutionary psychologists suggest that humans 

experienced evolutionary benefits from brain developments that included aversion to loss 

and risk, and from instincts for cooperation that helped strengthen communities.   

Measurement of well-being is an important direction, but just one of many new 

directions for economic measurement being explored in the field generally and at this 

conference in particular.  I am glad to see scholars and practitioners continuing to push 

the frontiers of economic measurement with a broad perspective and with open minds.  

As Arthur Conan Doyle’s immortal character Sherlock Holmes aptly put it, “It is a capital 

mistake to theorize before one has data.”7  As I said at the beginning, good economic

analysis and policymaking depend on good measurement, and the work you are doing 

will accordingly yield significant benefits.  I thank you for the opportunity to give these 

short remarks, and I wish you the best for a productive and stimulating conference.
