In recent months, financial conditions have eased, and there are encouraging signs 

that consumption has regained momentum.  On the other hand, there are tentative signs of 

slowing in the labor market and risks remain.1  We cannot take the resilience of our 

recovery for granted.   

Recent Developments 

 As we consider the appropriate posture of policy going forward, the most 

immediate question is whether the data provide confidence that domestic economic 

activity has strengthened notably following two disappointing quarters.  This is critical 

for making progress on the Committee’s dual mandate objectives of full employment and 

2 percent inflation.  The data in today’s labor market report on balance suggest that the 

labor market has slowed.  Nonfarm payroll employment increased at an average monthly 

pace of 116,000 over the last three months--well below the 220,000 per month average 

pace over the preceding twelve months.  The unemployment rate moved lower, reaching 

4.7 percent, a new low in the current recovery, but involuntary part-time employment 

increased and the labor force participation rate declined.   

Even so, there are reasons to expect that the labor supply still has room to respond 

if labor demand increases.  Importantly, the employment to population ratio for prime-

age workers still remains 1-3/4 percentage points below pre-crisis levels.  The recent data 

on wage inflation suggest a similar conclusion.  Although there have been some signs of 

increasing wage growth recently, the step-up has been modest, and growth in the broad 

measures of wages remains quite low.  For example, the average change over the past 

                                                 
I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text.

Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.

year across the three most commonly cited wage measures was about 2-1/2 percent, 

compared with an average change from the end of 2009 to the end of 2014 of 2 percent.2   

The recent news on inflation--the second leg of our dual mandate--has also been 

mixed.  The price of oil has rebounded significantly from the lows reached earlier in the 

year on expectations that supply and demand are likely to come into better alignment.  

Over the same period, the dollar has receded a bit, on net, from its peak in January, 

though it is still about 15 percent above the level in mid-2014 in inflation-adjusted trade-

weighted terms.  As a result, non-oil import prices look likely to stabilize this quarter 

after a year and a half of declines.  Still, it should be noted that these developments 

coincided with the easing in financial conditions since mid-February and are likely due, 

at least in part, to expectations of more gradual U.S. monetary policy tightening.  If those 

expectations were to shift materially, the conditions supporting higher inflation could 

diminish.   

While there are thus signs that inflation will move higher over the medium term, 

measures of core inflation have yet to convincingly exceed the low levels that have 

prevailed over much of the recovery.  The 12-month change in core personal 

consumption expenditure (PCE) prices, a reasonable proxy for the underlying trend in 

inflation, was only 1.6 percent in April.  This is still noticeably below our target and is 

roughly equal to the average change in core and total PCE inflation from the end of 2009 

to the end of 2014.      

We cannot rule out that stubbornly low inflation may be having an effect on 

inflation expectations.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation--which reflect 

                                                 
2 The three commonly cited measures of wages are the private-industry employment cost index, 

compensation per hour in the business sector, and average hourly earnings.   


 - 3 - 

inflation risk and liquidity premiums, as well as inflation expectations--remain extremely 

low.  For example, inflation compensation at the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon is 

currently around 1.5 percent, 1-1/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to 

mid-2014.  Some survey-based measures of inflation expectations are also somewhat 

below historical norms.  Median 5- to 10-year inflation expectations in the University of 

Michigan Surveys of Consumers, for example, over the past year have been on average 

about 1/4 percentage point below the average over the 10 years from 2005 to 2014. 

Thus, although some signs point to a firming of inflation going forward, I view 

the persistently low level of inflation during the recovery together with some signs of a 

deterioration in inflation expectations as suggesting that the risks to the return of inflation 

to our 2 percent target over the medium term are weighted to the downside. 

Progress toward our goals of full employment and 2 percent inflation will depend 

importantly on solid growth in aggregate demand.  Following disappointing gross 

domestic product (GDP) growth in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 

this year that averaged only 1.1 percent, I have been very attentive to incoming data, 

especially on consumption, which point to a pick-up in growth this quarter.3  In 

particular, consumer expenditures rose a strong 0.6 percent in April, and auto sales edged 

higher in May.  These are encouraging signs, but the data relevant for second-quarter 

growth are still relatively sparse. 

In general, demand growth in recent quarters has benefited from a relatively 

strong household sector--buoyed by a recovering labor market, reduced oil prices, and 

                                                 
3 Growth in gross domestic income (GDI) has not slowed as much as GDP growth recently.  However, the 

average of GDP and GDI growth has still slowed recently from an average annual rate of 2-1/2 percent 

from the third quarter of 2013 to the third quarter of 2015 to an average of 1-1/2 percent in the past two 

quarters.

low interest rates--and has been pulled down by weak business investment and net 

exports.  Indeed, consumption and housing investment can more than account for the 2 

percent increase in GDP over the past four quarters.  By contrast, business investment 

and net exports together subtracted 1/4 percentage point.  The rise in the dollar and 

decline in foreign growth reduced demand for American exports, as well as profits and 

investment at U.S. firms, which were also adversely affected by declines in the price of 

oil. Over the twelve months ending in April, manufacturing output increased only 0.4 

percent, while total industrial production, which also includes the drilling for, and 

extraction of, oil and gas, fell 1.1 percent.  Although the most recent indicators suggest 

that weakness in investment and net exports has persisted into the current quarter, if the 

easing in financial conditions since mid-February and the recent firmness in oil prices 

were to continue, along with stabilization of the dollar, business investment and exporters 

would benefit. 

Risks to the Outlook 

Of course, there are risks to the projection that future GDP growth will be strong 

enough to deliver progress on inflation and employment.  Most immediately, there is 

important uncertainty surrounding the United Kingdom’s June 23 “Brexit” referendum on 

whether to leave the European Union (EU).  The International Monetary Fund has noted 

that a vote in favor of Brexit could unsettle financial markets and create a period of 

uncertainty while the relationship between the United Kingdom and the EU is 

renegotiated.  Although the economic effects of this uncertainty and the costs of adjusting 

to altered trade and financial ties are difficult to quantify, we cannot rule out a significant 

adverse reaction to such an outcome in the near term, such as a substantial jump in 


 - 5 - 

financial risk premiums.  Because international financial markets are tightly linked, an 

adverse reaction in European financial markets could affect U.S. financial markets, and, 

through them, real activity in the United States. 

In addition, we should not dismiss the possible reemergence of risks surrounding 

China and emerging market economies (EMEs) more broadly.  In recent months, capital 

outflows in China have moderated as pressures on the exchange rate have eased.  Should 

exchange rate pressures reemerge, we cannot rule out a recurrence of financial stress, 

which would affect not only China but also other emerging markets that are linked to 

China via supply chains or commodity exports and, ultimately, conditions here.  China is 

making a challenging transition from export- to domestic demand-led growth, and the 

cost of reallocating resources from excess capacity sectors to more dynamic sectors could 

further impair growth in the near term.  While China has taken policy steps to limit the 

extent of the slowdown, there is an evident tension in policy between reform and 

stimulus, and the effect of the stimulus may already be waning.  Vulnerabilities--such as 

excess capacity, elevated corporate debt, and risks in the shadow banking sector--appear 

to be building, and could pose continued risks over the medium term.   

The fragility of the global economic environment is unlikely to resolve any time 

soon.  Growth in the advanced economies remains dependent on extraordinary 

unconventional monetary policy accommodation, while conventional policy continues to 

be constrained by the zero lower bound.  Conventional policy, whose efficacy is more 

tested and better understood than unconventional policies, can respond readily to upside 

surprises to demand, but presently would be constrained in adjusting to downside 


 - 6 - 

surprises.  This asymmetry in the capability of policy effectively skews risks to the 

outlook to the downside. 

It also may amplify the sensitivity of exchange rates.  Indeed, the evidence 

suggests that over the past year, dollar exchange rate movements have become 

considerably greater in response to U.S. monetary policy surprises than previously.4  The 

evidence that the sensitivity of exchange rate movements has been elevated lately is 

consistent with recent research suggesting that cross border financial transmission is 

likely to be amplified at near-zero interest rates where the ability to provide additional 

support through domestic channels in response to negative shocks may be viewed as 

limited.5  

In this environment, markets have become quite sensitive to the possibility of a 

prolonged period of low growth, low inflation, and economic underperformance.  One 

possible example of this sensitivity is the current negative term premium for 10-year 

Treasury notes, or the difference between the yield on the 10-year Treasury and expected 

risk-free short rates over the next 10 years.  Prior to the Great Recession, the term 

premium was positive, as bond investors seem to have been most concerned about the 

risk that inflation would be higher than expected.  But since the Great Recession, the term 

premium has been persistently negative, suggesting that investors have instead been 

focused on the risk of prolonged lower-than-expected inflation in the context of low 

growth and underperformance.6   

                                                 
4 Recent research by Federal Reserve staff suggests that over the past year, a surprise of 25 basis points in 

the Federal Funds rate following FOMC announcements has triggered dollar appreciation of over 5 percent, 

although the confidence interval is extremely large, and the coefficient has varied substantially over time, 

including intervals when the relationship has been negative. 
5 See Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2015). 
6 See Chen, Engstrom, Grishchenko (2016).  Another factor affecting the term premium is Federal Reserve 

asset purchases.  In addition, some have suggested the low term premium could reflect an “insurance” 


 - 7 - 

Thus, while the easing in financial conditions since mid-February is very 

welcome, it is important to recognize that some of the conditions underlying recent bouts 

of turmoil largely remain in place, and an important reason for the fading of this 

turbulence was the expectation of more gradual U.S. monetary policy tightening.7  

Should an event trigger renewed fears about global growth or a reassessment of the 

policy reaction function in the United States, turbulence could well return.   

Policy Implications 

On balance, recent developments have signaled continued progress toward our 

goals.  While signs of weakness in business investment and global demand remain, 

consumption and residential investment have held firm, and the labor market has moved 

closer to full employment.  At the same time, the relative stabilization in the dollar and 

oil prices in recent months has boosted somewhat the likelihood of a return to 2 percent 

inflation over the medium term.  However, the data on progress toward our inflation 

objective are equivocal.  Measures of underlying inflation have yet to convincingly signal 

a move back to 2 percent, and inflation expectations appear low, as I noted earlier. 

I want to emphasize that monetary policy is data dependent and is not on a preset 

course.  In this regard, I look forward to hearing the deliberations of the Committee.  

Recognizing the data we have on hand for the second quarter is quite mixed and still 

limited, and there is important near-term uncertainty, there would appear to be an 

advantage to waiting until developments provide greater confidence.  Prudent risk-

management would suggest the risks from waiting until the totality of the data provides 

                                                 
value that investors attach to Treasury securities because the price of Treasuries would be expected to rise 

if there are adverse shocks to the global economy.

conditions, see Del Negro, Giannoni, and Smith (2016).

greater confidence in a rebound in domestic activity, and there is greater certainty 

regarding the “Brexit” vote, seem lower than the risks associated with moving ahead of 

these developments.  This is especially true since the feedback loop through exchange 

rate and financial market channels appears to be elevated.  In light of this amplified 

feedback loop, when conditions are appropriate for a policy move, it will be important 

that it be understood that any subsequent moves would be conditioned on further 

evidence confirming continued progress toward our objectives and not as inevitable steps 

on a preset course. 

Indeed, several factors suggest that the appropriate path to return monetary policy 

to a neutral stance could turn out to be quite shallow and gradual in the medium term.  In 

particular, it appears likely that the medium-term neutral rate, or the real federal funds 

rate consistent with the economy remaining at full employment and 2 percent inflation, 

may be quite low.  With productivity running very low, substantial overcapacity and 

disinflationary pressures abroad, and less favorable demographics, the neutral rate may 

be lower and today’s federal funds rate closer to neutral than previously anticipated.  

Although we cannot observe the neutral rate directly, a variety of models suggests that it 

is currently very low relative to historical norms.  Earlier in the recovery it seemed likely 

that the low level of the neutral rate was largely due to temporary factors, such as tight 

credit, weak consumer confidence, and the loss in household wealth following the crisis.  

However, with the recovery well into its seventh full year, credit in many markets is 

widely available, while consumer confidence and household net worth are at high levels.  


 - 9 - 

As a result, it appears more likely that much of the decline in the neutral rate is likely to 

prove persistent, consistent with a variety of estimates.8   

One likely explanation for this persistence is the sharp drop-off in potential output 

growth since the Great Recession.  From 1953 to 2003, potential output growth varied 

between 3 and 4-1/2 percent, with one brief exception, according to the Congressional 

Budget Office.  Over the recovery, it has averaged only 1-1/4 percent.  One contributor to 

this decline has been a reduction in the labor force participation rate due to population 

aging.  Another has been a marked slowing in productivity growth.  Over the six years 

from the end of 2009 to the end of 2015, productivity grew only a little over 1/2 percent 

per year, compared with average growth of 2-1/4 percent over the 50 years prior to the 

Great Recession.9   

The reasons for such a dramatic slowing in productivity growth are not clear.  

Possible explanations include the fading of a one-time boost to productivity from 

information technology in the late 1990s and early 2000s; the reduced movement of 

resources from the least productive to the most productive firms, including new 

businesses, perhaps due to greater financial constraints for new and small businesses; and 

a delay between the introduction of new technologies, such as robotics, genetic 

sequencing, and artificial intelligence, and their effect on new production processes and 

products.10   

                                                 
8 See, for example, Laubach and Williams (2015); the estimates from the dynamic stochastic general 

equilibrium models cited in Yellen (2015); the median estimated neutral rate from the Federal Reserve 

Bank of New York’s most recent  Survey of Market Participants (Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 

2016); and Johannsen and Mertens (2016). 
9 Since the end of 2007, the average annual gain in productivity has been 1.1 percent.

Decker and others (2014, 2016), and Zarutskie and Yang (forthcoming).  For an investigation into whether 

mismeasurement may be responsible for some of the slowing in productivity growth, see Byrne, Fernald, 


 - 10 - 

To conclude, recent economic developments have been mixed, and important 

downside risks remain.  In this environment, prudent risk management implies there is a 

benefit to waiting for additional data to provide confidence that domestic activity has 

rebounded strongly and reassurance that near-term international events will not derail 

progress toward our goals.  In addition, because the depressed level of the neutral rate of 

interest reflects forces that are likely to persist, the appropriate path of policy is likely to 

remain shallow for several years.
