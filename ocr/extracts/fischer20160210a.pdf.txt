“The Lender of Last Resort:  An International Perspective,” a conference sponsored by

February 10, 2016 
 



I would like to thank Hal Scott for inviting me to address this conference.1  

The financial system is built on trust, which, history shows, from time to time 

breaks down as a financial panic develops.  Fortunately, major panics are relatively rare, 

but as we all know following the Great Financial Crisis, when they do occur they can be 

extremely destructive of economic activity. 

During the Great Financial Crisis, the Federal Reserve System worked together 

with the Treasury and other parts of the U.S. government to limit the damage caused by 

the crisis.  Although the financial crisis inflicted massive damage on the economy and on 

the public, the damage would have been far greater had the Fed not deployed its lender of 

last resort powers to deal with the incipient breakdown of the functioning of the U.S. 

monetary and credit systems.   

Changes in Regulation and Supervision 

In the wake of the crisis, acting within the framework of the Dodd-Frank Act, the 

Federal Reserve and the other supervisory agencies have taken a number of steps that 

reduce the likelihood that lender-of-last-resort loans will be needed.  First and foremost, 

banks and bank holding companies are much better capitalized.  Regulatory requirements 

have been made more stringent, global systemically important banks are subject to 

substantial additional capital requirements, and capital planning and supervisory stress 

testing make capital regulation more forward looking--and the importance of the stress 

tests bears emphasis.

     I am grateful to William Nelson, Scott Alvarez, Rochelle Edge, William English, Michael Gibson, and 
Mark van der Weide of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance.

Largely as a result of these measures, the common equity capital ratios of the 

largest U.S. bank holding companies have more than doubled since the crisis.  In 

addition, banking organizations are, for the first time, subject to a numerical liquidity 

requirement.  The requirement ensures that large banking organizations maintain buffers 

of high-quality liquid assets sufficient to meet cash outflows during a 30-day episode of 

systemic and idiosyncratic liquidity stress.  In addition, the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council has designated four key nonbanking institutions as “systemically important 

financial institutions,” and these firms are also subject to supervision and regulation by 

the Federal Reserve. 

These changes in supervision and regulation, along with the enhancement of 

resolution mechanisms for financial institutions, have made the financial system more 

resilient and lessened the probability that a lender of last resort will be needed to deal 

with financial stresses in the future.  Because the regulated firms are much better 

capitalized, doubts about their financial condition are less likely to arise, making them in 

turn less likely to lose access to funding in the marketplace.  Moreover, their substantial 

stockpiles of liquid assets should allow them to weather temporary periods of illiquidity 

without assistance or, if necessary, provide time for the authorities to implement an 

orderly resolution. 

While we have likely reduced the probability that lender of last resort loans will 

be needed in the future, we have not reduced that probability to zero.  We could, 

presumably, require financial institutions to fund illiquid assets entirely with longer-term 

debt and equity or, equivalently, allow them to use short-term liabilities to fund only safe 

and highly liquid assets.  However, such an approach would be costly in terms of reduced

lending to American businesses and households.  Moreover, as yields on credit products 

rise and yields on cash-like instruments decline, lending would become increasingly 

profitable and would likely move outside the regulated sector, probably leading to a need 

to widen the regulatory perimeter of the financial system. 

Lending to Insured Depository Institutions 

Although attention following the passage of Dodd-Frank Act has focused on the 

limitations it places on lender-of-last-resort lending, it must be noted that, if necessary 

and appropriate, the Federal Reserve has the authority to act as lender of last resort in 

several ways.  Most importantly, the Fed retains the power to extend discount window 

loans to insured depository institutions--including commercial banks, thrift institutions, 

credit unions, or U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.  Such loans can be to 

individual institutions facing funding pressures, or they can be to banks more generally to 

address broader financial stresses.2   

Since the Great Depression, the Fed’s actions as lender of last resort were 

undertaken using its authority to provide discount window funding to insured depository 

institutions.  Such was the case in the Federal Reserve’s reaction to the Penn Central 

default of 1970, the stock market crash of 1987, the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and the initial 

stages of the recent financial crisis in August 2007.  Discount window loans have to be 

collateralized to the satisfaction of the lending Reserve Bank, and it is noteworthy that all 

of the Federal Reserve System’s lending during the Great Financial Crisis was 

collateralized and that all the loans have been repaid in full, on time, and with interest.   

                                                 
2 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) imposes costs and a 
reporting requirement on the Federal Reserve Board in some cases if Federal Reserve lending to a weak 
depository institution that ultimately fails raises the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s costs of 
resolving the institution.

Although the Dodd-Frank Act did not change the Fed’s authority to lend to 

insured depository institutions, it has changed, among other things, the reporting 

requirements for such loans.  The act requires the Fed to publish information on any 

discount window loan, including the identity of the borrowers, with a two-year lag.  This 

change is consequential, because an important challenge for the Federal Reserve over the 

years has been the stigma associated with borrowing from the discount window.3  

Discount window access cannot serve as an effective means to backstop insured 

depository institutions’ liquidity if banks fear that borrowing from the discount window 

will signal to the public, their competitors, or their counterparties that the bank is in 

trouble.  Prior to Dodd-Frank, the Federal Reserve only published information on 

discount window borrowing in aggregate, but stigma was nonetheless an issue.  And I 

suspect that the stigma associated with the discount window is even higher, given the 

public’s incorrect association of ordinary discount window borrowing with “bailouts.”  

While the two-year lag should help limit the increase in stigma associated with the 

increased reporting requirement, the fact that the Fed will no longer be able to assert 

unequivocally that discount window borrowing is strictly confidential will likely add to 

the challenge of reducing stigma. 

                                                 
3 The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets and the Financial Stability Forum (since renamed 
the Financial Stability Board) identified the stigma associated with borrowing from the Federal Reserve’s 
discount window as a significant threat to financial stability.  See the President’s Working Group on 
Financial Markets (2008), “Policy Statement on Financial Market Developments” (Washington:  
President’s Working Group, March), p. 9, https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-

That aside, the Fed’s ability to act as lender of last resort to insured depository 

institutions was not significantly impeded by the Dodd-Frank Act.   

The Shadow Banking System 

During a crisis, liquidity pressures can materialize in the shadow banking sector--

that is, the set of nonbanks that use a range of markets and instruments to provide 

financing to borrowers.  At the time of their initial difficulties, both Bear Stearns and 

Lehman Brothers were in the shadow banking system.   

To help improve the resiliency of this sector, a few new regulations have been 

introduced, including the final rule on risk retention in securitization issued jointly by the 

Federal Reserve and five other agencies in October 2014 and the new money market fund 

rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July 2014.  Other 

provisions implemented since the crisis that should help address risks in the nonbank 

segment of the credit system include the central clearing requirement for standardized 

over-the-counter derivatives and margin requirements for uncleared swaps, as well as 

disclosure requirements that provide investors with standardized loan-level information 

for securitizations backed by certain assets, including residential and commercial 

mortgages.4  More recently, the SEC has also proposed rules to modernize data reporting 

by investment companies and advisers, as well as to enhance liquidity risk management 

and disclosure by open-end mutual funds, including exchange-traded funds. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve can, if needed in an emergency, and with the 

approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, lend through a broad-based facility, including 

                                                 
4 The SEC’s rule on disclosure requirements for certain securitizations was adopted by the SEC in August 
2014.  The intent of these rules is to make it easier for investors to review and access the information they 
need to make informed investment decisions, including independently conducting due diligence so as to 
better assess the credit risk of asset-backed securities.

to nonbanks, to provide liquidity to financial markets.  Indeed, during the financial 

crisis--which can be thought of as an old-fashioned bank run, but on the shadow banks--

the Fed’s credit facilities were used in an effort to stop the run in the shadow banking 

system.  Such broad-based facilities were instrumental in ensuring that money market 

mutual funds were able to liquefy their assets and so meet investor withdrawals, that the 

markets for critical short-term funding remained open, and that funding remained 

available for securitizations that were, in turn, funding loans to students, car buyers, small 

businesses, and others.  The facilities were many and varied, and developed as needed, 

because the U.S. financial system is complex and, as the crisis unfolded, the nature of the 

next phase was largely unforeseeable.  In several of these interventions, the Fed was 

lending to increase the liquidity of, or activity in, securities markets, in order to maintain 

the flow of essential credit to businesses and to households.5  Had that flow of credit 

ceased, the financial crisis, the severe recession that resulted, and the consequences for 

the U.S. economy, and thus every American, would have been far more serious. 

In November of last year, in a revision to its regulations reflecting the changes to 

the Federal Reserve’s emergency lending authority included in the Dodd-Frank Act, the 

Board spelled out how the Federal Reserve would design and operate such broad-based 

emergency lending facilities in the future.  Among other things, an emergency facility 

                                                 
5 For example, on October 7, 2008, the Federal Reserve established the Commercial Paper Funding Facility 
(CPFF).  Under the CPFF, the Federal Reserve lent to a special purpose vehicle that in turn purchased top-
rated three-month commercial paper directly from eligible issuers.  And on November 25, 2008, the 
Federal Reserve and Treasury announced the creation of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility 
(TALF).  Under the TALF, the Federal Reserve extended loans to investors in certain triple-A-rated asset-
backed securities (ABS) to promote renewed issuance of ABS, thereby increasing the availability of credit 
to households and small businesses.  See Dietrich Domanski, Richhild Moessner, and William Nelson 
(2014), “Central Banks as Lenders of Last Resort:  Experiences during the 2007-2010 Crisis and Lessons 
for the Future,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2014-110 (Washington:  Board of Governors of

would be designed to provide liquidity to a market or sector of the financial system and 

not be for the purpose of assisting a specific firm, or group of firms, in avoiding 

bankruptcy.  “Broad based” is defined to mean that there are at least five potential 

participants; further, even if many more than five firms were eligible for the facility, it 

could not be considered “broad based” if its purpose was to assist failing firms avoid 

bankruptcy or resolution, or to lend to insolvent borrowers.  In addition, the interest rates 

on the loans would be at penalty rates above those on similar forms of credit in normal 

times, and the loans would be backed by collateral that was sufficient to protect the 

taxpayer from losses.  All of these criteria are consistent with how the Federal Reserve 

operated its broad-based facilities in the crisis. 

Lending to Individual Nonbank Institutions 

During the crisis, the Federal Reserve also lent to individual nonbank institutions 

whose default would have been extremely damaging for the financial system and the state 

of the economy.6  The Dodd-Frank Act removed the Federal Reserve’s authority to lend 

to an individual troubled institution.7  Instead, the act required large banks and 

systemically important nonbanks to submit plans under which they could be resolved 

under bankruptcy in a rapid and orderly manner if they suffered material financial 

distress.  In addition, it established expanded authority for the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) to resolve a troubled systemic institution in an orderly manner that 

would not disrupt the rest of the financial system.  This expanded power includes the 

                                                 
6 The Federal Reserve used its authority to lend to individual nonbank institutions two times during the 
crisis:  It lent to Bear Stearns and AIG (American International Group, Inc.).  Working with the Treasury 
and the FDIC, it agreed to lend, but did not in fact extend credit, as part of ring-fence arrangements 
established for two additional firms, Bank of America and Citigroup.  See Domanski, Moessner, and 
Nelson, “Central Banks as Lenders of Last Resort,” in note 5. 
7 The Federal Reserve’s authority to lend to depository institutions cannot be used as a backchannel for 
lending to nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.

authority to convert some existing creditor claims into equity in a new bridge institution.  

If liquidity problems arose at the new bridge institution, the FDIC could guarantee the 

institution’s short-term liabilities, or it could act as a lender of last resort using funds 

provided by the Treasury and ultimately repaid by the institution and, if necessary, the 

banking industry through assessments. 

Deciding what authority should be given to a potential lender of last resort 

requires weighing the costs and benefits including, importantly, moral hazard.  Moral 

hazard costs may be substantial, especially when the potential borrower got itself into 

trouble by taking on excessive risk, and especially if the loan is seen as expanding the 

safety net.  But the costs of a disorderly default of a large interconnected firm may also 

be substantial, especially when the financial system is in a fragile state--as was the case in 

the default of Lehman Brothers.   

The best way to deal with those types of situations is to prevent them from 

occurring.  Such prevention requires appropriately tight supervision and regulation, 

consistent with the changes to supervision and regulation introduced in the past five years 

in the United States.  Further, strengthening resolution procedures to the point where they 

can be used to resolve an insolvent institution without causing runs and exacerbating a 

potential crisis is an essential component of the reform strategy underlying the Dodd-

Frank Act.8

Concluding Comments 

Overall, the U.S. financial agencies collectively have substantial lender-of-last-

resort authorities to meet future contingencies.  The Federal Reserve maintains the ability 

to provide liquidity to markets during times of unusual financial stress, including the 

authority to lend to insured depository institutions.  Indeed, for the 70 years between the 

Great Depression and the recent financial crisis, the Fed executed its lender-of-last-resort 

responsibility exclusively through such loans.  Moreover, broad-based facilities of the 

sort that the Fed operated during the financial crisis generally could still be introduced 

under our new regulations if they were needed to limit the effect of a future crisis on 

financial markets and the economy.   

And while the Federal Reserve no longer can lend to individually troubled 

nonbanks, the FDIC’s expanded resolution authorities should allow it to address troubles 

at such institutions with sufficiently low risk of cascading disruptions to the rest of the 

financial system and thus the economy.  Handling such situations through resolution has 

the advantage of ensuring that any costs are primarily incurred by the existing owners and 

creditors of the troubled firm, but such an approach is currently untried.  It is important 

that the government have the ability to execute the resolution seamlessly and with little or 

no warning--for example, Bear Stearns informed the Fed on a Thursday that it would 

default on Friday.9   

There are nonetheless three major sources of concern about potential weaknesses 

in the new framework for financial crisis management that has been introduced since the

Great Financial Crisis.  The first is its failure to resolve the problem of stigma--that is, the 

stigma of borrowing from the central bank at a time when the financial markets are on 

guard, looking for signs of weakness in individual financial institutions at a time of 

overall financial stress.10  Indeed, some of the Dodd-Frank Act reporting requirements 

may worsen the stigma problem.11   

The second is a concern that arises from the nature of financial and other crises.  

It is essential that we build strong frameworks to deal with potential crisis situations, and 

Dodd-Frank has done that.  But these plans need to ensure that the authorities retain the 

capacity to deal with unanticipated events, for unanticipated events are inevitable.  

Retaining the needed flexibility may conflict with the desire to reduce moral hazard to a 

minimum.  But, in simple language:  Strengthening fire prevention regulations does not 

imply that the fire brigade should be disbanded.12  

Third, this concern is heightened by a related problem:  The new system has not 

undergone its own stress test.  That is, in one sense, fortunate, for the financial system 

will undergo its fundamental stress test only when we have to deal with the next potential 

financial crisis.  That day will likely come later than it would have without Dodd-Frank 

and the excellent work done by regulators in the United States and around the world in 

strengthening financial institutions and the financial system.  But it will come, and when 

it comes, we will need the flexibility required to deal with it. 

                                                 
10 This concern is emphasized in Ben Bernanke’s blog post, “Fed Emergency Lending,” Brookings 
Institution, December 3, 2015, www.brookings.edu/blogs/ben-bernanke/posts/2015/12/03-fed-emergency-
lending. 
11 In particular, as I suggested earlier, the additional reporting requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act 
could increase potential borrowers’ concerns that the public, their creditors, or their counterparties could 
learn about their borrowing and conclude that the bank is in trouble.   
12 I think it would be a serious mistake, as some have suggested, to go beyond the limitations on the Federal 
Reserve’s emergency lending authority that are set out in the Dodd-Frank Act.
