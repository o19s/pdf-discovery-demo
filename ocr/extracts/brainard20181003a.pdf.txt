The Role of the Federal Reserve in Ensuring Safe and Reliable Payments 

It is a pleasure to be here in Chicago today to talk about payments.  The confidence that 

payments will be timely and dependable is a cornerstone of America’s dynamic and resilient 

economy.1   

Today, Americans take the reliability and safety of their payments for granted.  But that 

was not always the case.  The nation’s first 150 years were frequently disrupted by panics in the 

financial system that extended into the payment system, which was highly fragmented and 

inefficient.  Before the Federal Reserve took on a role in the payment system, a check recipient 

could not count on receiving the full value written on the check and faced long and unpredictable 

delays in getting access to the funds.  As a result of banks’ efforts to avoid excessive clearance 

fees, it could take days, weeks, or more to clear checks.  The Federal Reserve’s second 

Chairman, William P.G. Harding, described the circuitous, opaque, and costly route one payment 

made: “…a bank in Rochester, N.Y., sent a check drawn on a Birmingham, Ala., account to a 

correspondent bank in New York, which sent it along to a bank in Jacksonville, Fla.  From there, 

it traveled to Philadelphia, Baltimore and Cincinnati before it finally reached the originating 

bank in Birmingham.”2  The fragmentation of the payment system imposed costs on American 

merchants, households, community banks, and, ultimately, on the overall U.S. economy.   

Ensuring a reliable nationwide payment infrastructure was one of the motivations that led 

the Congress to create the Federal Reserve after the severe financial panic of 1907.  Fostering a

safe, efficient, and widely accessible payment infrastructure has been a crucial aspect of the 

Fed’s mission from its founding in 1913.  By creating a new core infrastructure for clearing and 

settling checks, the Fed was able to boost confidence in banks and America’s payment system, 

ensure Americans received the full value of their checks, and speed up payments.  

That was the first, but not the last, time that the Fed played a central role in transforming 

America’s retail payment system.  By the 1970s, the payment system was staggering under the 

weight of paper checks.  In 1973, Governor Jeffrey Bucher of the Federal Reserve Board 

described the exponential growth in check volume and the time-consuming and expensive 

process to clear paper checks as a “time bomb.”3  The Federal Reserve and payment system 

stakeholders faced a choice:  continue making incremental changes to manage the growing 

avalanche of checks, or look to technology to facilitate transformational change.     

Working with the private sector, the Federal Reserve chose transformation, and the effect 

was dramatic.  In partnership with the private sector, the Federal Reserve supported the 

implementation of the automated clearinghouse, or ACH system, to process payroll payments for 

individuals, bill payments for households, and vendor payments for businesses.  Before the 

advent of the ACH, it would typically take a week for an employee to be able to access the funds 

from a paycheck.  It would require first a trip to the bank during business hours to deposit the 

paycheck and then several business days for that bank to complete the time-consuming process 

of collecting the funds from the employer’s bank.4  With the advent of ACH, an employee could 

expect to access their pay from their bank on the same day it was deposited electronically by

their employer.  Today, the ACH operates with important roles for the private sector and the Fed, 

is available nationwide, and constitutes a vital piece of infrastructure supporting earlier access to 

funds and reliable settlement of payments.5   

Moving to 24/7 Real-Time Settlement 

Today, our payment system is again at a crossroads.  There is a growing gap between the 

transaction capabilities we need and expect in the digital economy--fast, convenient, and 

accessible to all--and the underlying settlement capabilities.    

Consumers and businesses increasingly expect to complete transactions with a simple 

keystroke, swipe, or tap.  If I want to split a restaurant tab with my friends, I can use an app on 

my smartphone.  But my friends have to be signed up for the same app to receive the payment, 

and they may have to wait for confirmation that the funds have moved from the app into their 

bank accounts before they can use the funds outside the app.  Similarly, if I want to make a 

purchase from a vendor online, all I have to do is upload my payment information and touch a 

screen to complete the purchase immediately.  But that payment in turn may not be immediately 

available to the seller.   

While we are seeing a growing demand for payments to be as instantaneous as the apps 

on our smartphones, in reality, under the hood, these payments currently rely on a patchwork of 

systems that can result in inefficiencies and delays, as well as uneven access.  To meet the 

expectations of our 24/7 app economy, there is a growing demand for broadly and nationally 

accessible faster payments that make funds available immediately.  Faster payments would allow 

                                                            
5 According to the Federal Reserve Payments Study 2016, in 2015, the ACH system was used for 23.5 billion 
payments, totaling $145.3 trillion in value. See www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/files/2016-payments-
study-20161222.pdf.

consumers and businesses to send and immediately receive payments at any time of the day, any 

day of the year, and provide recipients the ability to use their funds anywhere they choose.6   

Nascent faster payment services are emerging to address this demand from individuals 

and businesses for the capability to manage their finances more efficiently in real time.  These 

faster payment innovations are striving to keep up with this demand, but gaps in the underlying 

infrastructure pose challenges associated with safety, efficiency, and accessibility.  In many 

circumstances, the underlying infrastructure in place today cannot ensure that a fast payment is 

fully complete before the recipient seeks to use the funds.  To complete a payment, the banks 

behind the transaction need to transfer funds between each other.  Until this happens, the 

payment between them is like an “IOU.”   

Today’s systems that transfer funds between banks are not set up to work in a 24/7, real-

time world.  Instead, most faster payments settle funds between banks on a deferred basis.  

Deferred settlement entails a buildup of obligations--like IOUs between banks--that could 

present real risks to the financial system in times of stress.  Although faster payment systems that 

rely on deferred settlements can incorporate certain measures to mitigate these risks, these 

measures may be appropriate for a nascent faster payment market only for a limited time.  As we 

saw with the avalanche of paper checks prior to ACH, as the volume and value of faster 

payments grow over time, the potential risks of deferred settlement to the financial system are 

also likely to grow. 

To fully deliver on the promise of faster payments into the future, we need an 

infrastructure that can support continued growth and innovation, with a goal of settlement on a

within one minute as characteristics of a “very effective” faster payment service. Faster Payments Task Force,

24/7 basis in real time.  To ensure the robustness of the payment system into the future, banks 

and other providers acting as their agents should have access to a settlement system that operates 

24/7 and settles each payment as soon as an individual sends it.   

 While everyone stands to benefit from faster payments, the benefits could be especially 

important for households and small business owners who face cash flow constraints.  We know 

from the Fed’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking that four in 10 adults say 

they would need to cover an unexpected expense of $400 by borrowing or selling something, or 

simply be unable to pay.  A forthcoming Fed research note estimates that a quarter of households 

have less than $400 combined in their bank accounts.7  For these households, the difference 

between waiting for a payment to clear and receiving a payment in real time is not merely an 

inconvenience; it could tip the balance toward overdraft fees, bounced checks, or collections 

fees.  To be clear, faster payments would not address the root causes of these households’ 

financial fragility.  Even so, faster payments could help reduce the strain on some.  

 Similarly, many small businesses cite immediate access to working capital to finance 

inventories or pay employees as their number one constraint on growth.8  Smaller businesses and 

merchants would benefit from faster payments because of their need to tightly manage how 

much of their capital is tied up in unused material or inventory.  If a small business could count 

on its customers’ payments being immediately accessible in its bank account, it could reduce its 

need for short-term financing to cover the costs of ordering materials and goods well in advance.

The Role of the Federal Reserve in Faster Payments 

So what is our role at this moment of opportunity for the payment system?  In keeping 

with the Fed’s historical role in payments, five years ago we launched a collaborative effort with 

a broad array of stakeholders to catalyze a safe, efficient, and accessible faster payment system 

for the United States.  As part of that effort, 300 organizations representing consumers, 

businesses, banks, card companies, and technology providers, including many represented here 

today, came together to define expectations for the future of the retail payment system and to 

make recommendations on how to implement those expectations.  The members of the task force 

told us that the Federal Reserve needed to develop a 24/7 settlement system.9  The U.S. Treasury 

echoed this theme in a recent report.10   

Over the past year, we have undertaken an assessment of what the Federal Reserve could 

do to modernize its infrastructure to support interbank settlement of faster payments.  That 

assessment found that 24/7 payment-by-payment interbank settlement in real-time--what we 

refer to as real-time gross settlement (RTGS)--offers clear benefits in minimizing risk and 

maximizing efficiency.  A 24/7 economy with 24/7 real-time payments needs 24/7 real-time 

settlement, and RTGS is the way to achieve this.  That is where we believe that the Federal 

Reserve and the private sector together need to make investments for the future.  In this regard, 

the U.S. retail payment system lags behind some other countries:  the Reserve Bank of Australia 

and the European Central Bank have already implemented or are on the cusp of implementing 

RTGS systems to support private-sector faster payment services.

The Federal Reserve and payment system stakeholders have an opportunity to upgrade 

America’s payment system to meet the needs of households, businesses, and banks in the app 

economy.  Today, we are publishing a Federal Register notice that seeks public comment on 

potential steps the Federal Reserve could take to support the vision of RTGS of faster payments.  

The Reserve Banks could develop a service for RTGS that is available on a 24/7 basis to provide 

payment-by-payment interbank settlement in real time and at any time, on any day, including 

weekends and holidays.  The Reserve Banks currently provide payment services to more than 

11,000 banks across the country.  A 24/7 RTGS service provided by the Reserve Banks could 

significantly improve the prospect that banks of all sizes will have equitable access to a real-time 

interbank settlement infrastructure for faster payments in the long term.  

This common infrastructure would support connections across banks, and faster payment 

service providers acting as their agents, with the potential to weave together the current 

patchwork of systems.  As a result, we would also expect the overall safety of faster payments to 

increase.  The capability to finalize interbank settlement before funds are made available to the 

recipient would avoid an undesirable buildup of risk in the system.  The more banks that have 

access to real-time as opposed to deferred settlement mechanisms, the lower the risk would be 

from deferring settlement to the payment system as a whole.  Although RTGS may be 

operationally demanding, it offers clear benefits from a risk and efficiency perspective over the 

long term.    

 The development of a nationwide real-time interbank settlement infrastructure could also 

support the development of private-sector faster payment services, thereby increasing innovation 

and choice in the market.  Banks and technology providers of all sizes may be able to develop 

new services or enhance existing services by capitalizing on the underlying interbank settlement

infrastructure.  This could ultimately benefit all consumers by lowering costs, increasing choice, 

and improving quality.   

 In that regard, we are also seeking comment on whether the Reserve Banks should 

consider developing a liquidity management tool that would operate 24/7 in support of services 

for real-time interbank settlement of faster payments.  The tool could support settlement services 

provided by the private sector or the Reserve Banks.    

 The Federal Reserve has a responsibility to promote a payment system that serves the 

evolving needs of the public.  We hope to solicit as wide a range of views as possible as we 

consider these and possibly other options to support prompt, secure, and resilient settlement in a 

24/7 world.  To that end, the Federal Register notice poses a series of questions related to 

whether an RTGS is the appropriate strategic foundation for interbank settlement of faster 

payments.  We also solicit views on the appropriate role for the Federal Reserve in such a 

system.  We look forward to hearing from, and learning from, a broad array of stakeholders, 

including those who are actively involved in the provision of payment and banking services, as 

well as representatives of the consumers, households, and businesses who rely on the ability to 

make and receive payments every day. 

 The future of payments will be determined by the actions we take today.  We can wait 

and watch how these issues evolve on their own.  But this will likely result in a fragmented 

patchwork of systems that entails inefficiencies and risks and could leave behind many 

households, small businesses, and smaller banks.  Alternatively, we can work with other 

stakeholders to embrace innovation and design a faster payments infrastructure for the future to 

promote broad access and resilience.

As technological change continues to drive payments innovation, we continue to focus on 

the same basic objective that motivated our initial engagement in the payment system a century 

ago:  promoting a safe, efficient, and accessible payment system that serves the interests of all 

Americans.  The Fed has the unique ability to provide the infrastructure to reliably settle 

obligations between banks using balances at the central bank.  As such, we have a responsibility 

to serve the broad public interest by providing a flexible and robust payment infrastructure on 

which the private sector can innovate.  We look forward to hearing from you on the important 

choices before us as we work to safeguard the integrity and efficiency of our payment system.
