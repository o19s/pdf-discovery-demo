With Friday morning’s labor market data prominently in the news, I will start 

with the labor market and end with a discussion of monetary policy.1   

Recent reports pertaining to the labor market, including Friday’s release, have 

been solid, showing continued improvement.  So far this year, payrolls are reported to 

have increased by 180,000 per month.  That is down from last year’s gains of 230,000 per 

month but well above what is needed to provide jobs for new entrants into the labor 

force.  Despite the strong job growth, the unemployment rate, at 5 percent in September, 

has essentially moved sideways this year as individuals have come back into the labor 

market in response to better employment opportunities and higher wages.  As a 

consequence, the labor force participation rate has edged up against a backdrop of a 

declining longer-run trend owing to aging of the population.  This increase is a very 

welcome development.   

All told, with the unemployment rate not far from levels that most Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) participants view as normal in the longer run and the rise in 

the participation rate, I see the U.S. economy as close to full employment, with some 

further improvement expected.   

Real gross domestic product (GDP) rose at a subdued 1 percent pace during the 

first half of the year and only 1-1/4 percent over the past four quarters.  This pace likely 

underestimates the momentum in aggregate demand because it includes a sizable 

inventory correction that began early last year.  It is likely that this correction has by now 

run its course, and most analysts are expecting inventories to make a positive contribution

to demand over the second half of the year and for GDP to increase in the neighborhood 

of 2-3/4 percent.2   

Household spending has been the main contributor to real GDP growth over the 

past four quarters, and, with solid gains in employment and household income and upbeat 

consumer sentiment, this sector should continue to support growth over the second half of 

the year.  In contrast, residential construction has cooled this year despite rising home 

prices and low interest rates.  Housing starts have been moving sideways, suggesting 

little pickup in construction over the near term.   

In addition, business investment spending has been weak, held down in part by 

declining activity in the energy sector, which has obviously been hard hit by the steep 

drop in oil prices.  The recent stabilization of rig counts in the United States suggests that 

this source of restraint on business investment may be coming to an end.  That said, 

business investment outside of the energy sector has been unusually soft for the past three 

quarters, and this weakness will bear close watching.  Perhaps investment is being held 

down as firms respond to the flat trajectories for manufacturing and exports, reflecting 

subdued foreign demand and the appreciation of the dollar since mid-2014.  Another 

possibility could be that firms are reassessing the prospects for growth and profitability in 

an environment of weak productivity growth and are accordingly scaling back investment 

plans.  Notwithstanding these downside possibilities, I expect that business investment 

will pick up in the second half of the year as the drag from the oil sector wanes and as 

firms expand capacity to meet rising demand.

third quarter and 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter.

The combination of strong job gains and lackluster GDP growth over the past four 

quarters reflects exceptionally poor labor productivity growth.  Indeed, productivity 

declined 1/2 percent over the most recent four quarters and has increased only about 

1/4 percent per year, on average, since 2011.  While improving labor market conditions 

have led to higher household incomes in recent years, the key to improved living 

standards over the long haul will be a revival in productivity growth--at least to more 

normal levels, possibly in the range of 1-1/2 percent per annum. 

Foreign economies have been growing at a moderate pace, even in the face of 

numerous shocks, including concerns about China’s exchange regime at the start of the 

year and Brexit over the summer.  The economic effects of the steep appreciation of the 

dollar that began in mid-2014 have begun to fade, and U.S. exports have returned to 

growth following a weak 2015.    

Turning to inflation, I believe that transitory effects of the fall in oil prices and the 

rise in the dollar are the primary reason that inflation has fallen short of the FOMC’s 

2 percent goal.  Total personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation was 1 percent 

in August on a 12-month basis, held down by earlier declines in gasoline prices, but core 

PCE inflation has moved up somewhat, and its 12-month change stood at 1.7 percent in 

August.  As oil prices and the dollar stabilize, the drag on consumer price inflation from 

these sources ought to dissipate, and inflation will likely move closer to 2 percent.  This 

projection, however, depends critically on expectations for future inflation remaining 

reasonably well anchored; as the FOMC has noted, low readings for some indicators of 

expected inflation deserve close watching.

Let me now turn to the monetary policy outlook.  As you know, at our September 

meeting, the FOMC decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/4 to 

1/2 percent.  As we noted in the statement, the recent pickup in economic growth and 

continued progress in the labor market have strengthened the case for an increase in the 

federal funds rate.3  Indeed, in our individual economic projections prepared in advance 

of the September meeting, nearly all FOMC participants anticipated an increase in the 

target range for the federal funds rate by the end of this year.  Moreover, as economic 

growth has picked up and some of the earlier concerns about the global outlook have 

receded, the Committee judged the risks to the U.S. economic outlook to be roughly 

balanced.  

Given that generally positive view of the economic outlook, one might ask, why 

did we not raise the federal funds rate at our September meeting?  Our decision was a 

close call, and leaving the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged did not reflect 

a lack of confidence in the economy.  Conditions in the labor market are strengthening, 

and we expect that to continue.  And while inflation remains low, we expect it to rise to 

our 2 percent objective over time.  But with labor market slack being taken up at a 

somewhat slower pace than in previous years, scope for some further improvement in the 

labor market remaining, and inflation continuing to run below our 2 percent target, we 

chose to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward our objectives.   

As we noted in our statement, we continue to expect that the evolution of the 

economy will warrant some gradual increases in the federal funds rate over time to

achieve and maintain our objectives.  That assessment is based on our view that the 

neutral nominal federal funds rate--that is, the interest rate that is neither expansionary 

nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on an even keel--is currently low by 

historical standards.  With the federal funds rate modestly below the neutral rate, the 

current stance of monetary policy should be viewed as modestly accommodative, which 

is appropriate to foster further progress toward our objectives.  But since monetary policy 

is only modestly accommodative, there appears little risk of falling behind the curve in 

the near future, and gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be sufficient to 

get monetary policy to a neutral stance over the next few years.  

This view is consistent with the projections of appropriate monetary policy 

prepared by FOMC participants in connection with our September meeting.4  The median 

projection for the federal funds rate rises only gradually to 1.1 percent at the end of next 

year, 1.9 percent at the end of 2018, and 2.6 percent by the end of 2019.  Most 

participants also marked down their estimate of the longer-run normal federal funds rate, 

with the median now at 2.9 percent. 

However, as we have noted on many previous occasions, policy is not on a preset 

course.  The economic outlook is inherently uncertain, and our assessment of the 

appropriate path for the federal funds rate will change in response to changes to the 

economic outlook and associated risks.
