Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the Institute of International 

Finance’s Washington Policy Summit.  Before we begin our conversation, I want to share 

a few thoughts about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy.1 

Current Economic Situation and Outlook 

The U.S. economy is in a good place and operating close to both of the Federal 

Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  Real 

gross domestic product (GDP) rose about 3 percent last year, and in July, just a few 

months from now, the current economic expansion almost certainly will become the 

longest on record.  The unemployment rate is near the lowest level recorded in 50 years, 

and average monthly job gains have continued to outpace the increases needed over the 

longer run to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force.  Average hourly earnings 

are showing a welcome increase consistent with a healthy labor market, yet inflation 

remains near our 2 percent objective.  

All that said, the incoming data have revealed signs that U.S. economic growth is 

slowing somewhat from 2018’s robust pace.  Prospects for foreign economic growth have 

been marked down, and important international risks, such as Brexit, remain.  U.S. 

inflation as measured by the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, 

which excludes volatile food and energy prices and is a better gauge of underlying 

inflation pressures, has been muted.  And some indicators of longer-term inflation 

expectations remain at the low end of a range that I consider consistent with our price-

stability mandate.

The considerations I just mentioned have led most private-sector forecasters to 

project that growth will continue in 2019 but at a somewhat slower pace than in 2018.  At 

the Federal Reserve, in our most recent Summary of Economic Projections, the median 

participant on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) projected that in 2019, GDP 

growth of 2 percent will be the modal, or most likely, outcome; that core PCE inflation 

will rise to 2 percent; and that the unemployment rate will fall a bit further, to 3.7 percent, 

by the end of the year.  Again, these are modal outcomes, and, of course, my FOMC 

colleagues and I should and do factor in risks on either side of these projections in our 

policy deliberations. 

Monetary Policy 

Given this outlook for the U.S. economy, we decided at our March meeting that 

the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate.2  The federal funds rate is now in the 

broad range of estimates of neutral--the rate that tends neither to stimulate nor to restrain 

the economy.  Our baseline economic projections see economic growth for the year as a 

whole running somewhat above the Committee’s median estimate of its longer-run trend 

and core PCE inflation remaining near our 2 percent objective.  For these reasons, we 

have indicated we can be patient as we assess what adjustments, if any, will be 

appropriate to the stance of monetary policy. 

At our March meeting, the Committee also released revised Balance Sheet 

Normalization Principles and Plans, and it announced that the FOMC intends to slow the

runoff of our securities starting in May and to cease the runoff entirely in September.3  

This decision is the culmination of discussions that we had over the previous four 

meetings about our operating framework and reflects our desire to converge to a balance 

sheet that is no larger than it needs to be to conduct monetary policy efficiently and 

effectively.  In September, reserve balances likely will remain above the minimum level, 

including a buffer, consistent with this goal.  In that case, we anticipate we will likely 

hold the size of our balance sheet at the level reached in September for a time thereafter 

and let the gradual increase in other (nonreserve) liabilities, such as currency, slowly 

shrink the level of reserves.  Importantly, with this decision on the size of our balance 

sheet now taken, we can turn our attention in future meetings to discussing and deciding 

on the maturity composition of our System Open Market Account portfolio.   

As you may know, last November the Federal Reserve announced that in 2019 we 

are undertaking a System review of our monetary policy strategy, tools, and 

communications practices.  Information about this review can be found on the Federal 

Reserve Board’s website.4  In this review, we will listen to a broad range of stakeholders 

at public events held around the country, and we will draw on their insights as we assess 

how best to achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability in the most 

robust fashion possible.  Taking these viewpoints on board, the FOMC will begin its own 

discussions this summer on how we might refine our framework, and we will provide a 

public assessment after the review is complete.
