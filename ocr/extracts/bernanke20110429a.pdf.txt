Community Development in Challenging Times   


Remarks by 

Ben S. Bernanke 

Chairman 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

Federal Reserve Community Affairs Research Conference 

Arlington, Virginia 








 As always, I’m pleased to join you at the Federal Reserve’s biennial Community 

Affairs Research Conference.  This meeting brings together researchers, community 

development professionals, and public-sector officials to explore how best to strengthen 

struggling communities.  Needless to say, that endeavor is more crucial than ever.  The 

past few years have been very difficult.  Weak economic conditions at the national level 

have translated into hardships in many communities at the same time that communities 

have fewer resources available for stabilization and revitalization.  Considerable good 

work is going on nonetheless, and I will offer a few examples of that today. 

  At the national level, the economy is recovering at a moderate pace.  In particular, 

the labor market has been gradually improving and the unemployment rate has declined 

somewhat.  But unemployment remains quite high, particularly among minorities, the 

young, and those with less education.  What’s more, long-term unemployment remains at 

historically high levels.  Nearly half of the unemployed have been out of work for six 

months or more.  The housing market is also holding back the recovery.  The foreclosure 

rate remains very high, and many homeowners who have avoided foreclosure find 

themselves “under water,” meaning their mortgage debt exceeds the value of their homes.  

Obviously, the problems in the labor market and the housing market are not unrelated.  In 

particular, lost income from unemployment is causing many families to fall behind on 

their mortgage payments. 

The Challenges to Communities 

 As families have struggled, so have their communities.  In some areas, for 

example, high foreclosure rates have produced significant numbers of vacant properties, 

depressing surrounding home prices, attracting crime, and creating financial burdens for

local governments.  Thus, some community development groups now are simply trying to 

hold onto past progress that they have made in building up the physical infrastructure and 

human capital of their communities, while others have lost ground and are beginning the 

process of rebuilding.  

 While the scale of the problems has been exceptional, many of the problems 

themselves are not new for lower-income families and communities that were already 

struggling.  People who were vulnerable to begin with--those with low incomes, few 

assets, and less education--have had a more difficult time weathering the financial storm 

or recovering from setbacks.  The same is true for communities that were already 

relatively poor, with fewer community assets and insufficient drivers of economic 

growth. 

 To solve problems, we must first understand them.  Like many of you here today, 

the Federal Reserve has been engaged for some time in research and analysis of the 

economic challenges faced by neighborhoods and communities as well as by individuals 

and families.  For example, in 2008, the Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of 

Governors, in partnership with the Brookings Institution, published a study of the effects 

of concentrated poverty on communities.1  The communities studied included older inner 

cities in the North, smaller cities in the South and West, Native American reservations, 

“gateway” neighborhoods that are entry points for immigrants, and rural areas in 

Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta.  What these diverse communities had in common 

was that they did not share in our country’s general prosperity, even in good times.  Our

research identified some of the barriers to economic progress shared by these 

communities, including inadequate schools and workforce skills, lack of investment in 

infrastructure and business development, and limited institutional capacity.  Not 

surprisingly, these communities were particularly ill-equipped to deal with the recession.  

 Of course, economic conditions in a given community both affect and are affected 

by the economic status of the individuals and families in that community.  One of the 

most valuable sources of data on family finances is the Federal Reserve Board’s triennial 

Survey of Consumer Finances.2  To better understand the effects of the crisis on 

households, the Board, in a special update to its 2007 survey, asked the participants about 

their financial and personal circumstances two years later, in 2009.3  The findings help 

illustrate the challenges facing families and communities.  

According to this special survey, lower-income households continued to 

experience significantly more unemployment than higher-income households.  In 2009, 

nearly one-fourth of the families in the bottom half of the income distribution had at least 

one member who was out of work for some portion of the year prior to the survey; this 

rate was about double that of higher-income households.   

 Declines in the values of homes and stocks sharply reduced the wealth of many 

Americans during the crisis.  Three-fifths or more of families across all income groups 

reported a decline in wealth between 2007 and 2009, and the typical household lost 

nearly one-fifth of its wealth, regardless of income group.  Moreover, one in eight of the

Board,  March), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2011/201117/index.html.

households in the panel started the crisis with zero or negative net worth and thus had 

scant resources to fall back on to maintain their standard of living during bouts of 

unemployment.  

Unemployment and declines in wealth obviously can make it difficult for a 

household to pay its debts on time.  The survey update found that lower-income 

households fell behind on their payments at a substantially higher rate than higher-

income households.  Among households with debt, about 11 percent of those with 

incomes in the bottom half of the income distribution fell 60 days or more behind on at 

least one of their obligations in 2009, compared with nearly 3 percent of those in the 

highest tenth of the income distribution.   

 Just as lower-income households weather financial storms with more difficulty, 

the same is true of communities.  Even before the crisis, some neighborhoods, towns, and 

cities were in distress.  Those areas already lacked sufficient assets such as strong public 

schools and community facilities, and rising unemployment and falling tax revenues 

reduced the funds available for public services even as needs increased.  Often, residents 

were disproportionately unbanked or underbanked and relied on expensive alternative 

financial service providers.  In communities with already low housing values--due, for 

instance, to oversupply caused by population shifts--the wave of foreclosures that began 

in 2007 sent the number of vacant properties soaring, causing additional problems. 

 In short, the financial crisis and recession touched many families and 

communities.  But those that were struggling before the crisis were often 

disproportionately affected.

Responding to the Challenges 

 The challenges for those working to address the many evident problems in 

troubled communities can be daunting.  When so many social and economic problems are 

interconnected--high unemployment, foreclosures, crime, loss of tax revenues and social 

services, lack of economic opportunity--deciding where to start to improve the situation 

can be quite difficult.  Certainly no single program or approach will address all of the 

problems.  But realistically, we have to pick places to begin, with the expectation that 

finding solutions in one area will confer wider benefits.  For example, providing 

responsible credit for individuals and small businesses through community development 

financial institutions can stimulate economic activity that generates local tax revenues.  

Those tax revenues can be spent on programs to put vacant properties back into active 

use, helping to reduce crime, or on job training or economic development programs, 

leading to more employment and wage income that can help homeowners avoid 

foreclosures. 

As the Board’s eyes and ears around the country, the Federal Reserve Banks have 

kept us well informed of the variety of ways local communities are meeting the 

challenges of tough times in troubled communities.  Though the following is only a small 

sampling of the work going on around the country, I’d like to share a few of these stories 

with the hope that one community’s success may lead others to emulate it. 

 In Massachusetts, for example, a community development financial institution 

called Boston Community Capital is pursuing an innovative strategy to prevent occupied 

homes from becoming vacant and creating a strain on the community.  Through special 

financing entities, it buys foreclosed-upon but still occupied homes from lenders at 


 - 6 -

market value.  The initiative, dubbed Stabilizing Urban Neighborhoods, or SUN, is 

focused on six low-income neighborhoods in Boston that have the city’s highest 

concentration of foreclosures.  Taking advantage of the diminished home values, the 

group buys the properties and then resells them at affordable prices to existing 

occupants--both owners and tenants--who can demonstrate that they have suffered 

hardship.  This program prevents properties from becoming vacant and provides families 

with a sustainable and affordable housing situation; it is designed to start small and 

expand as needed.   

 In the South, ACCION Texas-Louisiana, a nonprofit organization, has been 

focused on assisting entrepreneurs start small businesses and helping existing small 

businesses to expand.  ACCION lends to entrepreneurs whose businesses are too small or 

too new to qualify for a regular bank loan.  Minority-owned businesses receive more than 

80 percent of its loans, and almost half of the lending goes to women-owned businesses.  

Since 2009, the organization has expanded from Texas into Louisiana to respond to small 

businesses affected by Hurricane Katrina.  The recession put extra pressure on ACCION, 

as existing borrowers were having increasing trouble paying back their loans.  At the 

same time, demand for its services increased, as newly laid-off workers were seeking 

loans to start their own businesses.  The organization responded by expanding its 

services--opening a business support center and business incubators, providing more 

comprehensive technical assistance, developing new business partnerships, reaching into 

new markets, and strengthening its underwriting platform to reduce waiting time for 

applicants and reduce its own costs.

 In my home state of South Carolina, as in many parts of the country, the effects of 

the crisis varies from community to community.  For instance, the city of Charleston, a 

popular tourist destination known for its historic architecture and fine cuisine, is faring 

relatively well overall.  Even so, both unemployment and poverty in the greater 

Charleston area increased significantly between 2007 and 2009.4  Median income in the 

nearby city of North Charleston, which has struggled ever since a naval base closed in 

1996, is about three-fourths that of Charleston.  In some older neighborhoods, families 

have moved out, leaving behind many vacant properties.  Some parts of the metropolitan 

area are experiencing economic growth, but the benefits of that growth do not reach all 

communities.  While some major corporations have expanded into the area, inadequate 

education and training, as well as the lack of public transportation, make it difficult for 

many residents of low-income and minority communities to take advantage of new jobs.  

Local development groups have been working to ameliorate the situation.  For example, 

Metanoia CDC, a community development corporation, is located in the heart of the old 

naval communities of North Charleston, and its work has visibly improved the hardest hit 

communities.  Its holistic range of programs--in community leadership, quality affordable 

housing, and economic development--appears to be contributing to decreasing crime, 

rising student grades, and homes for first-time homebuyers.  The group focuses on 

building assets--both physical and human--such as transforming vacant buildings into 

                                                 
4 For the Metropolitan Statistical Area, the poverty rate increased from 12.5 percent to 15.6 percent 
between 2007 and 2009 (for one-year estimates, see U.S. Census Bureau (2007), American Community 
Survey (Washington:  Census Bureau); and U.S. Census Bureau (2009), American Community Survey 
(Washington:  Census Bureau)) The unemployment rate in the area rose from roughly 4.5 percent to about 
11 percent between December 2007 and June 2009 (Bureau of Labor Statistics and Haver Analytics).

homes for families and helping students in a Young Leaders program improve their 

performance in school.   

 In the San Joaquin Valley of California, the unemployment rate hovers around 

18 percent.  In 2009, in response to the ongoing foreclosure crisis, nonprofit agencies; 

local, state, and federal agencies; academics; real estate professionals; financial 

institutions; small business and workforce development professionals; and loan servicers 

organized the San Joaquin Valley Foreclosure Task Force.  The original intent was to 

coordinate efforts on a regional scale to avoid preventable foreclosures.  This work 

continues, and the group is now expanding its efforts to also help families that have 

already gone through a foreclosure.  This year, the task force is beginning a series of 

foreclosure recovery workshops across the valley.  Families will learn about local 

programs and assistance, including job training and employment assistance.  Credit 

counselors will help them begin repairing their damaged credit.  And, in cases in which 

they may be victims of fraud, they will receive guidance and referrals to legal aid 

attorneys.   

 As a final example, in Cleveland, local leaders in the Slavic Village neighborhood 

have been dealing with some of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation since the 

1990s.  Cleveland saw population loss for five successive decades, resulting in an 

oversupply of housing.  With the onset of the financial crisis, the problem began to 

worsen dramatically.  By 2007, Slavic Village was the Zip code with the highest number 

of foreclosures in the nation.  By 2010, more than 1,500 properties in a neighborhood of 

11,000 homes needed to be demolished.  This community has a history of strong 

neighborhood organizations, and as might be expected, its residents, community leaders, 


 - 9 -

nonprofits, local governments, and companies stepped up their efforts.  In one 

partnership, community groups are using data provided by a local university to identify 

borrowers at risk of foreclosure and are reaching out to them, door to door, to see what 

might be done to prevent a foreclosure.  In another example, residents and community 

leaders in Slavic Village alerted county prosecutors to fraudulent lending in the 

neighborhood.  As the crisis continues to play out, community leaders have found ways 

to reuse vacant land, adding gardens, yard expansions, and bike trails among the 

neighborhood’s declining number of homes, making it safer and more attractive.  

Business leaders are helping as well by purchasing and demolishing properties adjacent 

to the gardens and trails and supporting the renovation and expansion of a nearby school 

and recreation center. 

 I have cited just a few examples of work that is making a difference at the grass-

roots level all around the country.  They show that, though the challenges in troubled 

communities are indeed daunting, we are far from helpless, and much good work is being 

accomplished.   

 For our part, we at the Federal Reserve will remain closely attuned to the 

economic health of all communities, including low- and moderate-income communities.  

Each of our Federal Reserve Banks works with local leaders and community groups to 

provide relevant research, data, and support, with the Board backing up these efforts 

across the country. 

 The broader economy is in a moderate recovery, and we have recently seen some 

welcome, if gradual, improvement in the labor market.  But our economy is far from 

where we would like it to be, and many people and neighborhoods are in danger of being 


 - 10 -

left behind.  The work of community groups, local leaders and businesses, and others is a 

critical component to a national economic recovery.  In addition to our work in regulating 

banks and in conducting monetary policy so as to achieve maximum employment with 

price stability, the Federal Reserve will continue to assist these efforts through local 

community outreach, by using its convening power, and through research like that being 

discussed at this conference.  If we work together, I believe we can find effective ways to 

repair the damage done by the crisis to the economic prospects of families and 

communities.  Until vulnerable families and troubled communities have regained lost 

progress, the economic recovery will remain incomplete.
