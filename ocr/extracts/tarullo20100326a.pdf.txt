 Effective responses to dire situations often require bold actions that would be 

unthinkable in calmer times.  So it was in the financial crisis, when central banks 

undertook extraordinary monetary policy measures and governments made major 

financial firms wards of the state.  Yet sometimes a crisis also accelerates adoption of 

policies and practices that might beneficially have been implemented beforehand and 

then are sensibly continued after the crisis has passed.  This evening I will examine an 

instance of this latter phenomenon, as defined by the Federal Reserve’s experience with 

comprehensive stress testing of major financial institutions during the crisis.   

 The Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) was fashioned in early 

2009 as a key element of a crucial plan to stabilize the U.S. financial system.  The stress 

tests, as they have been popularly called, required development on the fly, and under 

enormous pressure, of ideas that academics and supervisors had been considering for 

some time.  After describing the concept, design, and implementation of last year’s tests, 

I will explain how our experience has helped prompt major changes in Federal Reserve 

supervision of the nation’s largest financial institutions.  Then I will discuss how this 

experience has stimulated debate over the merits of publicly releasing supervisory 

information.1  

Origins and Execution of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program   

 By February 2009, many steps had already been taken to restore the health of, and 

confidence in, U.S. banks.  The U.S. Treasury had injected capital into banks under the 

Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP).  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had 

expanded guarantees for bank liabilities under its Temporary Liquidity Guarantee

Program.  And the Federal Reserve had established a number of lending programs to 

provide liquidity to financial institutions in addition to its aggressive monetary policy 

actions.   

 Despite these actions, a great deal of uncertainty remained about future bank 

losses and solvency, which was only increased by the rapidly deteriorating 

macroeconomic conditions in early 2009.  The Treasury determined that confidence 

could best be restored by making additional capital available to banks that were unable to 

raise from private sources the amounts necessary for them to continue to function as 

effective financial intermediaries even if economic conditions worsened appreciably.  To 

evaluate how much capital individual institutions might require, U.S. bank supervisors, 

led by the Federal Reserve, undertook a stringent, forward-looking assessment of 

prospective losses and revenues--a stress test--for the 19 largest U.S. banks.  Using TARP 

funds, the Treasury established the Capital Assistance Program (CAP) to provide any 

needed capital. 

 Let me summarize the mechanics of the stress tests.  First, in February 2009, each 

of the SCAP banks was asked to perform a capital-adequacy stress test under two 

economic scenarios--baseline and more adverse--using specified assumptions for gross 

domestic product (GDP) growth, unemployment, and house prices.  The baseline scenario 

reflected the consensus expectation among professional forecasters on the depth and 

duration of the recession.  The more adverse scenario was designed to be severe but 

plausible, with a probability of roughly 10 to 15 percent that each of the macroeconomic 

variables could be worse than specified.  The banks were asked to provide projections of 

losses and revenues under the two scenarios.  Losses were to be projected over a two-year

horizon for at least 12 separate categories of loans and a few other asset classes, using 

year-end 2008 financial statement data as a starting point.  To guide the banks, 

supervisors provided indicative loss-rate ranges for the system as a whole, derived from 

both analysis of historical loss experience at large banks and quantitative models relating 

loan performance to macroeconomic variables.  Banks were informed that loss estimates 

below the indicative range would be closely scrutinized.  

 Second, the supervisory teams evaluated the banks’ estimates to identify 

methodological weaknesses, missing information, overly optimistic assumptions, and 

other problems.  Examiners had detailed conversations with bank managers, which led to 

numerous modifications of the banks’ submissions.  Supervisors then made judgmental 

adjustments to the banks’ loss and revenue estimates based on sensitivity analyses 

performed by the firms, comparative analysis across the firms, and the supervisors’ own 

judgments. 

 Third, the supervisors supplemented these judgmental assessments with objective, 

model-based estimates for losses and revenues that could be applied on a consistent basis 

across firms.  Each participating institution was asked to supply, in a standardized format, 

detailed information that supervisors could use to estimate losses and revenues, such as 

details about loan characteristics.  These data allowed supervisors to make consistent 

estimates using independently constructed models.  Finally, supervisors systematically 

incorporated all of these inputs into loss, revenue, and reserve estimates for each 

institution.  These estimates were combined with information on existing reserves and 

capital to project capital buffers that the banks would need under the two scenarios.

 As you know, unlike other countries that conducted stress exercises, we took the 

highly unusual step of publicly reporting the findings of the SCAP, including the capital 

needs and loss estimates for each of the 19 banks.2  This departure from the standard 

practice of keeping examination information confidential was based on the belief that 

greater transparency of the process and findings would help restore confidence in U.S. 

banks at a time of great uncertainty.  Supervisors released the methodology and 

assumptions underlying the stress test first and then, two weeks later, the results for 

individual institutions.  The results showed that under the more adverse scenario, 10 of 

the 19 SCAP banks would need to raise a total of $75 billion in capital in order to have 

the capital buffers that were targeted under the SCAP--Tier 1 capital in excess of 

6 percent of risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 Common capital in excess of 4 percent of 

risk-weighted assets at the end of the two-year horizon.   

 The merits of publicly releasing firm-specific SCAP results were much debated 

within the Federal Reserve.  In particular, some feared that weaker banks might be 

significantly harmed by the disclosures.  In the end, though, market participants 

vindicated our decision.  They appeared to be reassured for three reasons.  First, the 

results were deemed credible by most market participants, owing in part to the release of 

details about our assumptions and methods, as well as the variation in assessment of the 

banks.  Second, the results were released at a time when uncertainty about bank 

conditions was very high, and some market participants feared the worst.  That is, 

perceptions of tail risk were very high, and the SCAP results helped reassure market 

participants that under a severe but plausible scenario, the capital needs of the largest

U.S. banks were manageable.  Third, the Treasury stood ready to make capital available 

to any SCAP bank with capital needs through the CAP if they were unable to raise 

private capital.   

In retrospect, it is clear that the public release of the SCAP results played an 

important role in stabilizing the financial system, as has our supervisory follow-up on 

improving capital levels.  By November 2009, the 10 banks that required additional 

capital had increased their Tier 1 Common equity by more than $77 billion, primarily by 

issuing new common equity, converting existing preferred equity to common equity, and 

selling businesses or portfolios of assets.  None of the SCAP banks received CAP funds.3    

Many observers initially criticized the stress tests as overly optimistic. On the one 

hand, they noted that GDP growth was weaker and unemployment higher in 2009 than 

projected in the more adverse scenario.  On the other hand, house prices did not fall as 

much as assumed under the more adverse scenario.  As of the end of 2009, actual losses 

at the 19 banks were less than one-half of the two-year loss estimates under the more 

adverse SCAP scenario, and actual revenues were more than one-half of the two-year 

revenue estimates.  Nevertheless, there is wide variation across the firms, and it is too 

soon to tell whether firms will perform better over the full two years than the SCAP 

estimates.    

The Lessons of the SCAP  

 As I suggested at the outset of my remarks, I doubt that anything as ambitious as 

the SCAP would have been tried--at least as soon as it was--but for the exigencies of the 

financial crisis.  Yet the approach we took in the SCAP was informed by discussions that

Financing Program.

had been taking place among supervisors and academics for some time.  Not surprisingly, 

against the backdrop of the crisis, the SCAP experience elaborated and confirmed 

principles that had been advocated internally by some supervisors, but that had not been 

broadly incorporated into the practice of regulatory agencies. 

 First, whether conducted by banks or supervisors, stress tests must consider 

severe but plausible scenarios, including low probability events with potentially highly 

adverse effects.  In the period leading up to the crisis--characterized by strong profits, 

excess liquidity, and low credit losses--too many banks and regulators were skeptical of 

the possibility of a rapid and severe deterioration such as ultimately occurred in the U.S. 

housing, mortgage,  and short-term funding markets.  If the crisis taught us anything, it is 

that we must test to the tail, not to the mode.  A related point is that a stress test will be 

most useful if applied to the full range of credit and trading exposures. 

 Second, good management-information systems are critical to the ability of firms 

to manage their risks.  Assessing risk exposures across an entire organization is essential 

to understanding the potential effect of correlated risk exposures that may reside in 

distinct business lines as well as different legal entities and regulatory jurisdictions.  Yet 

during the SCAP, many of the banks were unable to quickly and consistently consolidate 

risk exposures across products, business lines, legal entities, and geographies.  It does 

little good to run a stress test, even one using a sophisticated quantitative model, if it does 

not effectively capture all relevant exposures because the bank’s information systems are 

poorly managed or integrated.  

 Third, the SCAP highlighted the importance of having multiple inputs into the 

risk-assessment process.  It was critical to have, and use, the best available data.  But it 


- 7 - 
 


was equally important not to become a slave to any one model or method of estimating 

losses.  It was precisely the combination of rigorous, data-driven analyses and considered 

judgment that made the stress test successful.  The interactive and iterative nature of the 

process helped refine each method of assessment. 

 Fourth, the SCAP underscored the importance of both horizontal and 

macroprudential perspectives in supervising banking organizations.  During the SCAP, 

simultaneous, consistent, and comparative cross-firm assessments allowed a broader 

analysis of risks, easier identification of outliers, and better evaluation of individual firm 

estimates.  Because SCAP banks held the majority of U.S. banking assets, it also allowed 

for a better understanding of interrelationships and systemic risks.   

Turning now to how the SCAP experience has informed our supervisory policies, 

I think its effects are best understood in the overall context of the reforms motivated by 

the financial crisis.  Like regulators around the world, we are developing and 

implementing improvements in capital and other prudential rules.  The Congress is 

considering legislative proposals to enhance market discipline through such means as a 

special resolution mechanism for large financial firms and to affect the structure of the 

financial services industry through such measures as the Volcker rule and limitations on 

acquisitions by systemically important firms.  These three modes of reform--rules, market 

discipline, and structural measures--must be complemented by more-effective 

supervisory oversight, particularly of the largest, most complex financial institutions.  To 

this end, the Federal Reserve is now implementing a more closely coordinated 

supervisory system in which a cross-firm, horizontal perspective is an organizing 

supervisory principle.  We will concentrate on all activities within the holding companies

that can create risk to the firm and the financial system, not just those that increase risk 

for insured depository institutions.   

An essential component of this new system will be a quantitative surveillance 

mechanism for large, complex financial organizations that will combine a more 

macroprudential, multidisciplinary approach with the horizontal perspective.  

Quantitative surveillance will use supervisory information, firm-specific data analysis, 

and market-based indicators to identify developing strains and imbalances that may affect 

multiple institutions, as well as emerging risks to specific firms.  Periodic forward-

looking scenario analyses will enhance our understanding of the potential effects of 

adverse changes in the operating environment on individual firms and on the system as a 

whole.  

In fact, I believe that the most useful steps toward creating a practical, 

macroprudential supervisory perspective will be those that connect the firm-specific 

information and insight gained from traditional microprudential supervision to analysis of 

systemwide developments and emerging stresses.  Here, precisely, is where our SCAP 

experience has helped lead the way. 

The Question of Transparency    

One important element of the SCAP that has not yet been incorporated into our 

ongoing supervisory plans is the public disclosure of stress test information.  I think this 

issue deserves consideration.  As I recently testified, access to higher-quality and more-

timely information about financial products, firms, and markets is necessary for effective

 supervision.4  Making data public--to the degree consistent with protecting firm-specific 

proprietary information--would have additional benefits.  In the specific context of 

greater transparency in supervisory stress tests, I see at least two. 

First, the release of details about assumptions, methods, and conclusions would 

expose the supervisory approach to greater outside scrutiny and discussion.  Sometimes 

those discussions will help us improve our assumptions or methodology.  At other times 

disclosure might reassure investors about the quality of the tests.  Either way, the public’s 

reaction to our assumptions and methods would be useful.   

Second, because loan portfolios are inherently difficult to value without a great 

deal of detailed information, increased transparency could be an important addition to the 

information available to investors and counterparties of the largest institutions.  If, as I 

believe, progress on the too-big-to-fail problem is integral to an effective reform of 

financial regulation, we must enhance market discipline.  The market discipline made 

possible by such means as special resolution mechanisms and contingent capital will be 

most effective if market participants have adequate information with which to make 

informed judgments about the banks.  

There are, to be sure, countervailing concerns.  In more normal economic times, 

when market participants are not fearing the worst and when banks do not have access to 

government capital injections as a backstop, the revelation that some major banks may 

have capital needs under a stress scenario might be unnecessarily destabilizing.  This

possibility would be increased if market participants attached undue weight to specific 

capital or loss numbers released by the government. 

 In practical terms, there are several ways we might increase transparency.  One, of 

course, would be to follow the SCAP precedent, with periodic release of detailed 

information about the assumptions, methods, and results of a cross-firm, horizontal, 

forward-looking exercise, including firm-specific outcomes.  This approach would 

probably maximize both the potential benefits and potential risks.  Note, however, that 

the possibility of a destabilizing market reaction may be lower if such information is 

released frequently, as major unpleasant surprises would be less likely with frequent, 

detailed disclosures.  Of course, significant changes in the economic environment might 

still lead to unpleasant surprises when the results are released.5   

 A second option would be to provide details about the assumptions and methods 

supervisors employed in the stress tests but withhold public release of results for 

individual banks.  This practice could be coupled with a requirement for more systematic, 

timely, and consistent disclosure by the largest banks of information on material 

firmwide risk positions and exposures, funding and liquidity profiles, operating 

performance, and other measures.  Like the first approach, this option would have the 

benefit of opening supervisors’ methods to discussion.  By increasing the disclosure of 

banks’ risk exposures, this approach would also enhance market discipline, as market 

participants could make their own forward-looking assessments of banks’ conditions.  

However, some benefit would be lost, since the information from individual banks would 

not have been standardized or verified by regulators.  Concomitantly, while the risk of an 

                                                 
5 In addition, it would be important to assure that the routine release of selected supervisory information did 
not undermine our ability to maintain the confidentiality of other supervisory information.

overreaction to the release of information would still exist, there would be no single 

number on which market participants could focus.  

 A third possibility would be to have supervisors release aggregate results of their 

horizontal, forward-looking assessments, along with details about their assumptions and 

methods, without requiring additional disclosure by firms.  This approach could still 

confer considerable benefits by providing information to the public about the overall 

condition of the banking system as well as about supervisory methods.  It has, in fact, 

been applied by Japan’s Financial Services Agency (FSA), which conducted a special 

bank inspection in 2002 and 2003, when Japanese banks were still recovering from a 

crisis.  The FSA publicly released aggregate results showing the differences between the 

banks’ and the FSA’s assessments of loan quality, which showed that the FSA’s 

assessments were more stringent than the banks’.  Many of the major banks subsequently 

increased their loan loss reserves, and the inspections appeared to increase confidence in 

the banking system.  Of course, the informational benefit to market participants could be 

substantially diluted if they are unable to distinguish the conditions of individual firms as 

reflected in the aggregate numbers.   

Conclusion  

 To conclude, you should now have a sense of the degree to which our experience 

with SCAP has informed changes in our supervision of large institutions as part of the 

broader enterprise of regulatory reform.  As to the issue of stress test transparency, I look 

forward to hearing how others assess the merits of the alternative approaches I have 

described and, of course, any new ideas.
