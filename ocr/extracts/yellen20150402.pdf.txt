It is my pleasure to welcome you to the Federal Reserve System’s community 

development research conference, which this year focuses on economic mobility.  I 

would like to commend the organizers for their foresight in choosing a topic that has 

risen to the top of the global agenda.  According to a recent Pew Research Center survey, 

the gap between rich and poor now ranks as a major concern in the minds of citizens 

around the world.  In advanced economies still feeling the effects of the Great Recession, 

people worry that children will grow up to be worse off financially than their parents 

were.  In the United States, roughly 80 percent of Americans across the ideological 

spectrum see inequality as a moderately big or very big problem.1   

Economic inequality has long been of interest within the Federal Reserve System.  

In 2007, Chairman Bernanke delivered a speech on the causes of rising inequality that 

raised questions about the implications of this disturbing trend for economic 

opportunity--the topic that will be explored at this conference today and tomorrow.2  

Chairman Bernanke’s speech called for more research to understand the causes and the 

effects of widening inequality in the United States.  Last October, I drew on the Fed’s 

Survey of Consumer Finances--a rich source of data for researchers in this field--to 

explore some factors that may influence economic mobility, such as access to quality 

education and ownership of a family business, and I discussed how those factors may 

have changed over time.3  But I noted the difficulty of reaching definitive conclusions

and, like Chairman Bernanke, expressed my hope that more research would be dedicated 

to finding answers to these important questions.   

I hope that the work that has been gathered and will be presented and discussed at 

this conference--as well as the research it may inspire--will further this worthy goal.  In 

carrying out its responsibilities, the Federal Reserve serves the public in a number of 

different ways, and I believe an important contribution comes via the Fed’s role as a 

research institution.  Separate from the work that directly supports the Fed’s decisions on 

monetary policy and financial oversight, Fed economists and other researchers in 

Washington and at each of the 12 Reserve Banks are engaged in a broad array of 

independent academic research aimed at adding to the general knowledge and 

understanding of the economy.   

Each year, Fed staff members publish hundreds of papers and others forms of 

research, sometimes in collaboration with scholars from universities and other 

institutions, all of it available for use by the research community and on view to the 

public.  Conferences play an integral role in promoting the Federal Reserve’s research 

mission as well.  This biennial community development research conference, organized 

by community development officials from across the Federal Reserve System, serves to 

encourage high-quality research and also helps bridge the gap between community 

development research, policy, and practice.   

In my brief remarks, I would like to mention a few aspects of economic mobility 

that I think are particularly important and worthy of further research, with the hope of 

stimulating the conversation that will take place here over the next couple of days.  This

conference will explore economic mobility as it is influenced by or affects families, 

communities, and the economy, so let me touch on each of those three facets. 

We know that families are the locus of both opportunities and barriers to 

economic mobility.  There are important research questions to be tackled here.  What 

individual or family characteristics may predict who will achieve upward mobility?  How 

much does someone’s initial circumstances in life influence how far that person can get 

or how hard he or she needs to work to get there?  Researchers and policymakers need a 

better understanding of how much mobility individuals may experience over the course 

of their lives and at what age people’s outcomes may become more difficult to change. 

Families are the source of many of the resources and experiences that influence 

economic mobility, and more research can help us understand to what extent and in 

which ways differences in the economic circumstances of families affect the upward 

mobility and economic security of offspring.  Research may be able to provide evidence 

on which public policies are most helpful in building an economy in which people are 

poised to get ahead.  Conversely, it would also be beneficial to understand whether any 

policies may hold people back or discourage upward mobility. 

There is some debate on how the level of economic mobility in the United States 

may have changed in recent decades and whether it is easier or more difficult for people 

to get ahead today than it was in previous generations.  Shortly, you will hear from a 

panel of distinguished experts with a range of views on this topic.  Looking at the very 

recent past, we should also be asking whether and how this may have changed coming 

out of the Great Recession.  Later, my Federal Reserve Board colleague, Governor 

Brainard, will speak on a topic of significant interest to me and I expect to many others--

how young adults are faring in the economy and what the short- and long-term 

implications may have been for entering the job market at a time of significantly 

constrained opportunities.  This is another example of how exogenous factors--those over 

which individuals have little or no control--may play an important role in determining 

how easily someone is able to improve his or her circumstances.   

Communities also affect economic mobility, and here, too, more research is 

needed to understand how and to what extent these effects occur.  Economists do not 

fully understand how locational differences affect economic mobility or the complex 

relationship between economic mobility and geographic mobility.  There are community 

characteristics--for instance, the composition and level of local employment, schools, 

transportation, physical infrastructure, and community facilities--that may affect the 

economic mobility of the residents of that community.  And there is also a community 

development analogue to economic mobility:  Further research may help us better 

understand why some communities succeed or fail in generating jobs, developing 

successful small businesses, attracting infrastructure investment, and so on.  How do 

some places advance economically and create circumstances in which residents, in turn, 

are more likely to thrive? 

Finally, there are important research questions to be answered about the 

relationship between economic mobility and the economy as a whole.  It seems obvious 

that greater economic opportunity and mobility promotes a healthier economy.  

Entrepreneurship, innovation, and hard work--surely key contributors to individual 

mobility--are central to a strong economy as well.  But research could help us better 

understand how much mobility at the individual level matters for overall growth in

productivity and economic output.  To what extent is income mobility influenced by 

domestic or global economic forces, and to what extent can we promote mobility through 

domestic policy choices? 

These are among the questions that will be discussed and debated at this 

conference.  You have a terrific lineup of speakers, and I think it is going to be a 

fascinating and informative two days.  Thank you again to the many people at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the Federal Reserve Board, and from across the System who 

have put this conference together.  And thanks to all of you for coming here to be a part 

of it.
