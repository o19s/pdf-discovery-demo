I have been asked to close this ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the 

signing of the Federal Reserve Act--the law that created the Federal Reserve--by looking 

ahead to the next century.  Given the well-known difficulties that economists have in 

forecasting even the next few quarters, I will happily point out one important advantage 

in making a 100-year forecast, which is that I won’t be around to explain why the 

forecast went wrong.  Our ability to make accurate long-term forecasts is limited, to say 

the least.  Nevertheless, I will venture one prediction that I don’t think is too bold, which 

is this:  The values that have sustained and served the Federal Reserve at its best, and 

have permitted it to make critical contributions to the economic health of our nation 

during the past century, will continue to serve it and the nation well in the century ahead. 

Among the Fed’s most important values is the belief that policymaking should be 

based on dispassionate, objective, and fact-based analysis.  The ideal we seek is a 

combination of the researcher’s intellectual rigor and the ability of the effective 

policymaker to navigate the messiness of the real world, a world that includes complex 

institutions and markets, imperfect and incomplete data, and often-unpredictable human 

behavior.  

Of course, policy analysis and implementation of the highest quality do not just 

happen.  They require professionalism and a commitment to public service as 

exemplified by the generations of staff members who have served this institution so well.  

Without the expertise and creativity embodied in the staff, it would have been impossible 

to develop the innovative policies required to meet, in the words of the Federal Reserve 

Act, the “unusual and exigent circumstances” we confronted during the recent financial 

crisis.  If there is one thing on which I believe all of us here can agree, it is that the

quality of the staff has been a great strength throughout our institution’s history.  

Maintaining that quality and commitment to public service will be essential if the Fed is 

to have a successful second century. 

 Dispassionate analysis, expertise, and commitment to public service--all are 

values that have served us well.  But one value that strikes me as having been at least as 

important as any other has been the Federal Reserve’s willingness, during its finest hours, 

to stand up to political pressure and make tough but necessary decisions.  The fight 

against inflation during Paul and Alan’s times in office was critical for the nation’s 

longer-term prosperity, and it required perseverance in the face of heavy criticism.  I keep 

in my office one of the 2-by-4s mailed to the Fed during Paul’s tenure, which 

communicates some distinctly unfavorable views of high interest rates and their effects.  

More recently, of course, the Federal Reserve took controversial but necessary measures 

to arrest what was arguably the worst financial crisis in American history, helping to 

avert what likely would have been a much more severe economic downturn than the 

Great Recession we did experience. 

We have been able to respond nimbly to economic emergencies and make 

difficult choices in part because of our institutional structure--including long terms for 

members of the Board of Governors and diverse regional representation in our 

policymaking Committee--and because of the willingness of policymakers, past and 

present, to do whatever was needed in the longer-run interest of the economy.  As an 

institution, the Federal Reserve must continue to be willing to make tough decisions, 

based on objective, empirical analysis and without regard to political pressure.

But, finally, we must also recognize that the Fed’s ability to make and implement 

such decisions ultimately depends on the public’s understanding and acceptance of our 

actions.  For this reason, we must continue to emphasize two other essential values--

transparency and accountability.  We must do all that we can to explain our actions and to 

show how they serve the public interest.  That’s why we must welcome communication, 

broadly defined.  Of course, we will continue to talk to economists and market 

participants, but that is not enough.  Ultimately, the legitimacy of our policies rests on the 

understanding and support of the broader American public, whose interests we are 

working to serve.  The ability of this institution to support a healthy economy--an 

economy with high levels of employment, low inflation, and a stable financial system--

will require our continued efforts to engage in two-way communication--explaining our 

actions and, importantly, listening to what our fellow citizens have to say. 

Let me end by thanking the organizers of this event and, in particular, all of the 

past and present policymakers in attendance for helping us mark this centennial milestone 

in such a memorable fashion.
