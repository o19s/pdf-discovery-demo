Good morning.  I am very pleased to welcome you here today.  This conference is 

part of a first-ever public review by the Federal Open Market Committee of our monetary 

policy strategy, tools, and communications.  We have a distinguished group of experts 

from academics and other walks of life here to share perspectives on how monetary 

policy can best serve the public.  

I’d like first to say a word about recent developments involving trade negotiations 

and other matters.  We do not know how or when these issues will be resolved.  We are 

closely monitoring the implications of these developments for the U.S. economic outlook 

and, as always, we will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor 

market and inflation near our symmetric 2 percent objective.  My comments today, like 

this conference, will focus on longer-run issues that will remain even as the issues of the 

moment evolve.  

While central banks face a challenging environment today, those challenges are 

not entirely new.  In fact, in 1999 the Federal Reserve System hosted a conference titled 

“Monetary Policy in a Low Inflation Environment.”  Conference participants discussed 

new challenges that were emerging after the then-recent victory over the Great Inflation.1  

They focused on many questions posed by low inflation and, in particular, on what 

unconventional tools a central bank might use to support the economy if interest rates fell 

to what we now call the effective lower bound (ELB).  Even though the Bank of Japan 

was grappling with the ELB as the conference met, the issue seemed remote for the 

United States.  The conference received little coverage in the financial press, but a 

                                                 
1 The proceedings of the conference were published in the November 2000 issue of Journal of Money, 
Credit and Banking.

Reuters wire service story titled “Fed Conference Timing on Inflation Odd, but Useful” 

emphasized the remoteness of the risk.2  Participants at the conference could not have 

anticipated that only 10 years later, the world would be engulfed in a deep financial 

crisis, with unemployment soaring and central banks around the world making extensive 

use of new strategies, tools, and ways to communicate. 

 The next time policy rates hit the ELB—and there will be a next time—it will not 

be a surprise.  We are now well aware of the challenges the ELB presents, and we have 

the painful experience of the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath to guide us.  Our 

obligation to the public we serve is to take those measures now that will put us in the best 

position deal with our next encounter with the ELB.  And with the economy growing, 

unemployment low, and inflation low and stable, this is the right time to engage the 

public broadly on these topics.   

The review has several parts, all of which are intended to open our monetary 

policy to critical examination.  We are holding a series of Fed Listens events around the 

country to help us understand the perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds and 

with varied interests.  This conference and many other engagements will help us bring to 

bear the best thinking from policymakers and experts.  Beginning later this year, the 

FOMC will devote time at a series of our regular meetings to assess lessons from these 

events, supported by staff analysis performed throughout the Federal Reserve System.  

We will publicly report the outcome of our discussions.  In the meantime, anyone who is

Before turning to the specifics of the review, I want to focus a little more closely 

on the challenges we face today.  For a reference point, at the time of the 1999 

conference, the United States was eight years into an expansion; core inflation was 

1.4 percent, and the unemployment rate was 4.1 percent—not so different from today.4  

Macroeconomists were puzzling over the flatness of the Phillips curve, the level of the 

natural rate of unemployment, and a possible acceleration in productivity growth—

questions that are also with us today.5 

The big difference between then and now is that the federal funds rate was 

5.2 percent—which, to underscore the point, put the rate 20 quarter-point rate cuts away 

from the ELB.  Since then, standard estimates of the longer-run normal or neutral rate of 

interest have declined between 2 and 3 percentage points, and some argue that the 

effective decline is even larger.6  The combination of lower real interest rates and low 

inflation translates into lower nominal rates and a much higher likelihood that rates will 

fall to the ELB in a downturn.  

As the experience of the past decade showed, extended ELB episodes can be 

associated with painfully high unemployment and slow growth or recession.  Economic

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/review-of-monetary-policy-strategy-tools-and-
communications-fed-listens-events.htm.  
4 The inflation rate referenced is the October 12-month percent change in the price index for personal 
consumption expenditures excluding food and energy. 
5 The discussion of all these issues was centered on Fed Chair Alan Greenspan’s (1998) “New Economy” 
hypothesis that the United States had undergone fundamental changes for the better, leading to the 
otherwise puzzling outcomes. 
6 See, for example, the estimates of the neutral rate reported on the New York Fed’s website at 
https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/rstar.  Rachel and Summers (2019) give reasons why the 
effective change may be larger.

weakness puts downward pressure on inflation, which can raise real interest rates and 

reinforce the challenge of supporting needed job growth.  In addition, over time, inflation 

has become much less sensitive to tightness in resource utilization.  This insensitivity can 

be a blessing in avoiding deflation when unemployment is high, but it means that much 

greater labor market tightness may ultimately be required to bring inflation back to target 

in a recovery.  Using monetary policy to push sufficiently hard on labor markets to lift 

inflation could pose risks of destabilizing excesses in financial markets or elsewhere.   

In short, the proximity of interest rates to the ELB has become the preeminent 

monetary policy challenge of our time, tainting all manner of issues with ELB risk and 

imbuing many old challenges with greater significance.  For example, the behavior of 

inflation7 now draws much sharper focus.  When nominal interest rates were around 4 or 

5 percent, a low-side surprise of a few tenths on inflation did not raise the specter of the 

ELB.  But the world has changed.  Core inflation is currently running a bit below 

2 percent on a trailing 12-month basis.  In this setting, a similar low-side surprise, if it 

were to persist, would bring us uncomfortably closer to the ELB.  My FOMC colleagues 

and I must—and do—take seriously the risk that inflation shortfalls that persist even in a 

robust economy could precipitate a difficult-to-arrest downward drift in inflation 

expectations.  At the heart of the review is the evaluation of potential changes to our 

strategy designed to strengthen the credibility of our symmetric 2 percent inflation 

objective.   

                                                 
7 For example, based on the Federal Reserve staff’s Greenbook forecast, across forecasts prepared for 
59 FOMC meetings between 1997 and 2004, one-third of the year ahead, four-quarter inflation forecast 
errors were 0.5 percentage point or greater in absolute value.  Error tended to be on the low side, and 
45 percent of low-side misses were greater than 0.5 percentage point in absolute value.

The ELB problem also complicates the FOMC’s efforts to achieve transparency 

and accountability.  The Fed, like most major central banks, is insulated from short-term 

political pressures.  In our democracy, that insulation carries with it an obligation for us 

to be transparent and publicly accountable.  When policy rates reached the ELB during 

the crisis, central banks resorted to what were then new, untested tools to pursue their 

mandated goals.  These tools are no longer new, but their efficacy, costs, and risks remain 

less well understood than the traditional approaches to central banking.  My FOMC 

colleagues and I are committed to explaining why the use of these tools in the wake of 

the crisis was a prudent and effective approach to pursuing our congressional mandate 

and why tools like these are likely to be needed again.  Our review is but one part of our 

efforts to engage with the public on these matters.   

Let me turn to the specifics of the review, which is focused on three questions: 

1. Can the Federal Reserve best meet its statutory objectives with its 

existing monetary policy strategy, or should it consider strategies that 

aim to reverse past misses of the inflation objective?  

2. Are the existing monetary policy tools adequate to achieve and 

maintain maximum employment and price stability, or should the 

toolkit be expanded? 

3. How can the FOMC's communication of its policy framework and 

implementation be improved? 

These questions are quite broad, and my colleagues and I come to them with open 

minds.  We believe our current policy framework is working well, and we have made no 

decisions about particular changes.  In fact, the review is still in its early stages.   


 - 6 - 

The first question raises the issue of whether the FOMC should use makeup 

strategies in response to ELB risks.  By the time of the 1999 conference, research was 

beginning to show that—in models, at least—such strategies could substantially reduce 

the unemployment and other costs of ELB spells.8  The simplest version goes like this:  

Suppose that a spell with interest rates near the ELB leads to a persistent shortfall of 

inflation relative to the central bank’s goal.  But what if the central bank promised 

credibly that it would deliberately make up for any lost inflation by stimulating the 

economy and temporarily pushing inflation modestly above the target?  In the models, the 

prospect of future stimulus promotes anticipatory consumption and investment that could 

greatly reduce the pain of being at the ELB.9  Policymakers discussed this reasoning in 

the wake of the crisis, but neither the Fed nor any other major central bank chose to 

pursue such a policy.10  Why?  For makeup strategies to work, households and businesses 

must go out on a limb, so to speak, raising spending in the midst of a downturn.  In 

theory, they would do this based on their confidence that the central bank will deliver the 

makeup stimulus at some point—perhaps years in the future.  In models, great confidence 

in central bankers is achieved by assumption.  Despite the flattering nature of this 

                                                 
8 See Reifschneider and Williams (2000) and references therein.  For a more recent review of this subject, 
see Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Mertens and Williams (2019). 
9 Eggertsson and Woodford (2003), for example, show that optimal policy at the ELB entails a commitment 
to reflate the price level during subsequent economic expansions.  See also Wolman (2005) for a discussion 
of the effectiveness of price-level targeting at the ELB.  For a discussion of the relationship between price-
level targeting and average-inflation targeting, see Nessén and Vestin (2005).  The strategy in 
Reifschneider and Williams (2000), for instance, involves a central bank following a Taylor rule modified 
to make up for shortfalls in policy accommodation during ELB episodes.  Kiley and Roberts (2017) study a 
strategy in which policymakers aim for inflation higher than 2 percent during normal times to compensate 
for below-target inflation during ELB episodes.  Also see Bernanke (2017) for a strategy in which low 
inflation is made up if it occurs when the federal funds rate is at or near the ELB.  See also Bernanke, 
Kiley, and Roberts (2019) and Mertens and Williams (2019). 
10 The Bank of Japan (2016) came closest, announcing in September 2016 an “inflation-overshooting 
commitment” (p. 1).  The commitment did not, however, come with any explicit goal for a degree or 
duration of overshoot.

assumption, crisis-era policymakers had major questions about whether their promise of 

good times to come would really have moved the hearts, minds, and pocketbooks of the 

public.  Part of the problem was that the groundwork had not been laid in advance of the 

downturn—a problem we could hope to fix well before next time.  Policymakers also had 

deeper concerns about the legitimacy and effectiveness of attempting to bind some future 

FOMC to take actions that could be objectionable from a short-term perspective when the 

time came to deliver.11 

Research on makeup strategies has begun to grapple more seriously with the 

credibility questions.12  But important questions remain.  To achieve buy-in by 

households and businesses, a comprehensible, credible, and actionable makeup strategy 

will need to be followed by years of central bank policy consistent with that strategy.   

The second question asks about the adequacy of the Fed’s toolkit for providing 

stimulus when facing the ELB.  In the United States, we used several different 

formulations of both forward guidance and large-scale purchases of longer-term 

securities.13  While views differ on the effectiveness of these policies, with their use, the 

unemployment rate fell steadily and inflation expectations remained well anchored, 

outcomes that were favorable overall when viewed against the recoveries of many other 

advanced economies.  My own view is that these policies provided meaningful support 

for demand, but that they should not be thought of as a perfect substitute for our 

                                                 
11 These issues were discussed by the FOMC at several points, especially during 2011 (see the 2011 FOMC 
transcripts, available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomchistorical2011.htm). 
12 See, for example, English, López-Salido, and Tetlow (2015); Hebden and López-Salido (2018); 
Bernanke, Kiley, and Roberts (2019); and Mertens and Williams (2019). 
13 For details on formulations used by the United States for forward guidance and large-scale purchases of 
longer-term securities as well as other references, see, for example,

traditional interest rate tool.  In any case, we have a responsibility to thoroughly evaluate 

what mix of these tools is likely to work best when the next ELB episode arrives.  

Perhaps it is time to retire the term “unconventional” when referring to tools that 

were used in the crisis.  We know that tools like these are likely to be needed in some 

form in future ELB spells, which we hope will be rare.  We now have a significant body 

of evidence regarding the effectiveness, costs, and risks of these tools, including those 

used by the FOMC and others tried elsewhere.  Our plans must take advantage of this 

growing understanding as assessments are refined.  

The third question concerns improving communication, which I discussed earlier 

from the standpoint of governance and accountability.  But transparency also plays a 

central role in policy effectiveness through its effects on the expectations of households 

and businesses.  Of course, this was the major insight behind the transparency revolution 

in central banking over the past few decades.  Today, central banks publicly share a large 

and ever-increasing amount of information about policy.  But policymakers and 

commentators inside and outside central banks sometimes question whether all of the 

transparency adds up to effective communication.14   

The FOMC’s famous dot plot is one example.  A focus on the median forecast 

amounts to emphasizing what the typical FOMC participant would do if things go as 

expected.  But we have been living in times characterized by large, frequent, unexpected 

changes in the underlying structure of the economy.15  In this environment, the most 

                                                 
14 A 2016 Brookings conference titled “Understanding Fedspeak” (see 
https://www.brookings.edu/events/understanding-fedspeak) raised several aspects of this issue.  For 
example, Olson and Wessel (2016a) presented results of a survey of those who follow the Fed closely; in an 
op-ed (2016b), they noted that “Some 73 percent of academics said Fed communications helps the markets; 
only 44 percent of private-sector Fed watchers agreed.”  
15 For more on changes in the underlying structure of the economy, see Powell (2018).

important policy message may be about how the central bank will respond to the 

unexpected rather than what it will do if there are no surprises.  Unfortunately, at times 

the dot plot has distracted attention from the more important topic of how the FOMC will 

react to unexpected economic developments.  In times of high uncertainty, the median 

dot might best be thought of as the least unlikely outcome.  

Let me conclude by saying that I look forward to our discussions here and to the 

ongoing work of the review that lies ahead.  We need the best tools and strategies 

possible for dealing with the challenges we now face, and we must communicate them in 

a clear and credible way.  My colleagues and I welcome your best thinking on these 

issues.
