America’s Central Bank:  The History and Structure of the Federal Reserve 
 
 
 

Remarks by 
 

Jerome H. Powell 
 

Member 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the 
 

West Virginia University College of Business and Economics 
Distinguished Speaker Series 

 
Morgantown, West Virginia 


March 28, 2017 
 



I am delighted to have this opportunity to speak at West Virginia University.  

Thanks to Brian Cushing for inviting me here today.1 

Gathered in this part of West Virginia, we are located in the Fifth Federal Reserve 

District, which stretches down from here to South Carolina and east to the Atlantic Ocean 

(figure 1).  More than 100 years ago, the organizers of the Federal Reserve System 

divided the country into 12 of these Districts, each with its own Federal Reserve Bank.  

Together, the Board of Governors in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks are the key 

elements of the Federal Reserve System. 

Today I will discuss how the Federal Reserve came to have this unique structure.  

The Fed’s organization reflects a long-standing desire in American history to ensure that 

power over our nation’s monetary policy and financial system is not concentrated in a 

few hands, whether in Washington or in high finance or in any single group or 

constituency.  Rather, Americans have long desired that decisions about these matters be 

influenced by a diverse set of voices from all parts of the country and the economy.  The 

structure of the Federal Reserve was designed to achieve this broad representation and 

promote a stronger financial system to build resiliency against the sort of periodic 

financial crises that had repeatedly damaged the country in the 19th and early 20th 

centuries.  This structure was forged from compromise; the result of that compromise was 

a vitally needed central bank whose decisions take into account a broad range of 

perspectives. 

                                                 
1 My remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily those of the Board of Governors of the 
Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open Market Committee.

Before the Federal Reserve 

The question of how to structure our nation’s financial system arose in the early 

years of the republic.  In 1791, Congress created an institution known as the Bank of the 

United States, often considered a forerunner of the Federal Reserve.  The Bank was 

created in part to assist the federal government in its financial transactions, a typical 

responsibility of central banks at that time.  It was also designed to help America’s 

financial system meet the needs of a growing economy--the same purpose behind the 

founding of the Federal Reserve more than 100 years later.  The most famous proponent 

of the Bank was Alexander Hamilton, who has recently achieved the central banker’s 

dream of being the subject of a hit Broadway musical (figure 2). 

Congress gave the Bank of the United States unique powers--its notes were 

accepted for making payments to the federal government and it was the only bank able to 

branch across state lines (figure 3).  The Bank could affect the ebb and flow of credit 

around the country.2  People in different regions of the country came to have distinct 

views about the Bank.  Borrowers in the western areas--in those times, the West meant 

places like Ohio--desired cheap and abundant loans but were also wary of lenders.  These 

borrowers grew opposed to the power of the Bank in the credit market.  Northern 

business interests favored the Bank’s contribution to the country’s industrial 

development, but at times disagreed with actions taken by the Bank to constrain credit.  

Southern agriculturalists viewed the Bank with suspicion but supported its occasional 

                                                 
2 The Bank of the United States became a net creditor to state banks by holding the notes issued by those 
banks.  When it presented those notes for redemption, it could affect the funding position of state banks and 
effectively constrain credit in this manner.

actions to constrain credit to non-agricultural businesses.3  The Bank’s private ownership, 

intended to give it independence from government control, was a source of unpopularity.  

Ultimately, these disagreements undermined the Bank’s political support.  After 20 years, 

Congress chose not to renew the Bank’s charter.  A second Bank of the United States met 

a similar fate in 1836 when President Andrew Jackson vetoed a bill to extend its life 

(figure 4). 

These two short-lived experiments illustrate a theme in American history--of 

Americans from different regions holding distinct views about the structure and 

development of the financial system.  People in the newer western parts of the country 

saw themselves as starved of access to credit and viewed higher interest rates in their 

areas as reflecting the scarcity of funds.  Regional interest rate differentials persisted until 

around the time of World War I and helped shape the attitudes of Americans living in 

western areas toward the nation’s financial system.4 

These regional differences gave rise to a major political movement in the latter 

part of the 19th century, as western farm borrowers increasingly demanded a reform of 

the U.S. monetary system.  Their chief complaints included the high interest rates they 

faced as well as the burdens placed on them by deflation that increased the real value of 

their debts.  Indeed, the economy experienced 1 to 2 percent deflation annually in the 

years leading up to the 1890s.  The country’s currency was linked to gold, and deflation 

reflected the growing scarcity of gold relative to the amount of economic activity.  The

York:  Cambridge University Press). 
4 See Lance E. Davis (1965), “The Investment Market, 1870-1914:  The Evolution of a National Market,” 
Journal of Economic History, vol. 25 (September), pp. 355-93.  Economic historians have debated the 
extent to which interest rate differentials reflected market segmentation and supply versus demand in each 
market.  Other factors include higher risk premiums, reflecting higher expected default rates in some areas 
of the country, and varying levels of monopoly power.

“free silver” movement grew in response to these economic forces.  Its most famous 

advocate, William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic presidential nominee in 1896, sought 

an increase in the money supply--by the coining of silver in addition to gold--as a 

solution to reversing this deflation (figure 5).5 

The Founding of the Fed 

By the beginning of the 20th century, the debate about monetary policy and the 

nation’s financial system had been going on for over a century.  Increasingly, the 

shortcomings of the existing system were causing too much harm to ignore.  Like a 

drumbeat, the country experienced one serious financial crisis after another, with major 

crises in 1839, 1857, 1873, 1893, and finally in 1907.6  These panics paralyzed the 

financial system and led to deep and extended contractions in the economy. 

These episodes exposed the weakness of our 19th century financial system, which 

repeatedly failed to supply the money and credit needed to meet the economy’s demands.  

The financial system came under severe stress when the demand for liquidity surged.7  A 

                                                 
5 For a sense of the regionalism of this debate, believe it or not, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has been 
interpreted as an allegory for 19th century regional monetary problems, though there is little evidence about 
the intentions of its author, L. Frank Baum, in conveying this allegory.  Dorothy was from Kansas, a farm 
state, but after a cyclone, she found herself in a world dominated by gold, with a yellow brick road and the 
Land of Oz--the abbreviation for an ounce.  The story has four witches--from the West, East, North, and 
South.  Remember that the Wicked Witch of the West ultimately met her demise when she melted on 
contact with water, a symbol for the end of a drought that contributed to the economic hardships of western 
farmers.  But the most powerful change was brought about by Dorothy’s shoes, which were originally 
owned by the Wicked Witch of the East.  Importantly, these shoes were silver in the original book, not red 
as in the movie, symbolizing the power of bimetallism as a solution to western problems.  See Hugh 
Rockoff (1990), “The ‘Wizard of Oz’ as a Monetary Allegory,” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 98 
(August), pp. 739-60. 
6 See Andrew J. Jalil (2015), “A New History of Banking Panics in the United States, 1825-1929:  
Construction and Implications,” American Economic Journal:  Macroeconomics, vol. 7 (July), pp. 295-
330. 
7 Contemporaries blamed these crises on the seasonality in demand for currency and credit related to 
planting and harvesting of crops in the spring and fall.  Modern scholars place more weight on other 
sources of financial tightness.  Some point to poor harvests that depressed net exports, particularly failed 
cotton harvests.  Net exports were an important source of increases in the money supply in this period.  In 
the context of the gold standard, poor money supply growth in the United States triggered certain 
expectations by international capital market participants that interest rates in the United States would rise

financial system strained in such a manner is like dry kindling in danger of being exposed 

to a spark.  That spark could come from losses at a well-known bank, from a 

disappointing harvest, or from mere rumors.  In response, depositors or other investors 

would seek the return of their funds, which would force financial institutions to sell assets 

quickly to generate the necessary cash (figure 6).  That liquidation could lead banks to cut 

credit and force borrowers to repay debt sooner than expected. 

Simply put, the monetary system did not meet the country’s needs.  It was a 

system in crisis, boiling over repeatedly, harming the country. 

Central banks are designed in part to help the financial system meet occasional 

liquidity strains.  When demands for liquidity rise, central banks can respond by 

increasing the supply of money and thus adding liquidity to the system.  Central banks 

have a particularly important role in avoiding or mitigating extreme demands for liquidity 

during financial crises.  They do this by making loans to solvent financial institutions so 

they can meet their liquidity demands and avoid forced sales of their assets.  These ideas 

about central banks’ lending role were developed over the course of the 19th century but 

not yet implemented in the United States, which at the time remained without a central 

bank.8  By the beginning of the 20th century, the United States was behind the game. 

                                                 
relative to the rest of the world.  As a result, interest rates on American commercial paper (a key rate 
affected by international financial conditions) rose following poor harvests, stock and bond prices fell, and 
deposits flowed out of the New York banking system.  Industrial production decreased as well, with a lag.  
This set of effects created tight financial conditions of the sort that could lead to financial crises.  (See 
Christopher Hanes and Paul W. Rhode (2013), “Harvests and Financial Crises in Gold Standard America,” 
Journal of Economic History, vol. 73 (March), pp. 201-46.)  Other scholars focus on business cycle 
downturns as creating conditions favorable to financial crises, as depositors viewed the downturns as 
affecting the solvency prospects of their banks, leading to withdrawals and panics.  (See Gary Gorton 
(1988), “Banking Panics and Business Cycles,” Oxford Economic Papers, vol. 40 (December), pp. 751-81.)

Charles Scribner’s Sons).

The final catalyst leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve was the severe 

Panic of 1907, which caused inflation-adjusted gross national product to decline by 12 

percent, more than two times the decline recorded during the Great Recession of 2007 to 

2009.9  After the panic ended, there was a broad sense that reform was needed, although 

consensus on the exact nature of that reform was elusive.  Some called for an institution 

similar in structure to the Bank of England at the time, with centralized power, owned 

and operated by the banking system.  Some wanted control to be lodged with the federal 

government in Washington instead.  Others proposed that power be distributed to 

regional bodies with no central or coordinating board.  Still others resisted any sort of 

central bank.10  This debate reflected the many and diverse interests in the United States--

farmers, laborers, businessmen, small-town bankers, big-city bankers, technocrats, 

populists, and more--that experienced different conditions across a large geographic 

expanse. 

The resulting institution was a compromise, created by the Federal Reserve Act in 

1913.  The Federal Reserve was not structured to be entirely private in its ownership and 

operation.  It was also not structured to have a single headquarters in Washington or New 

York with branches across the country, a structure that was proposed but failed to attract 

enough political support.  Instead, a more federated system was created, establishing the 

Federal Reserve Board in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks located around the 

country.

The Board was the part of the System intended to be most directly accountable to 

the public (figure 7).  The Board is an independent agency within the federal government, 

and members of the Board--now called Governors--are appointed by the President and 

confirmed by the Senate.11  Governors serve 14 year terms that expire at 2-year intervals 

and are not linked to election cycles.  The Federal Reserve Board is charged with general 

oversight of the Reserve Banks. 

The Reserve Banks combine both public and private elements in their makeup and 

organization (figure 8).  Like the Board of Governors, the Reserve Banks operate with the 

public interest in mind.  Commercial banks that are members of the Federal Reserve 

System are required to purchase stock in their District’s Reserve Bank.12  These shares 

are nontransferable and yield only limited powers and benefits.  Dividends are set by 

federal law.  The commercial bank shareholders elect two-thirds of the directors that 

oversee the Reserve Banks; the Board in Washington appoints the remaining one-third.  

Only three bankers can serve on a Reserve Bank’s board of directors, and only one of 

those can be from a large commercial bank in the District.  The remaining six directors 

represent the interests of the public.  The Federal Reserve System benefits enormously 

from the insights and support of the boards of directors of the Reserve Banks and their 

                                                 
11 As originally enacted, Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act required that the President, in nominating 
Board members, “have due regard to a fair representation of the different commercial, industrial and 
geographical divisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, ch. 6, § 10, 38 Stat. 260 (1913), p. 12, 
www.federalreservehistory.org/Media/Material/Event/10-58).  In 1922, this representational requirement 
was expanded to its current form, which provides, in Section 10(1), that the President “have due regard to a 
fair representation of the financial, agricultural, industrial, and commercial interests, and geographical 
divisions of the country” (see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 241 as amended by an act of June 3, 1922 
(42 Stat. 620), paragraph on appointment and qualification of members, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section%2010.htm).  In addition, Section 10(1) provides that 
no two members of the Board may be from the same Reserve Bank District. 
12 All national banks chartered by the Comptroller of the Currency are required to be members of the 
Federal Reserve System, and state-chartered banks may choose to become members.

Branches.  Directors include prominent private-sector leaders who represent a wide and 

growing diversity of backgrounds and views about the economy.13 

The federated structure of the Federal Reserve System earned the endorsement of 

even the populist hero of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, William Jennings Bryan.  

The compromise created an institution that could address the shortcomings of the 

American financial system while assuring that control of the Federal Reserve would be 

shared widely.14  The structure was different from those of the first and second Banks of 

the United States, and from those of foreign central banks at the time.  Congressman 

Carter Glass, who worked to win passage of the Federal Reserve Act in Congress, called 

the Federal Reserve’s uniquely American design “an adventure in constructive finance” 

(figure 9).15 

The Modern Federal Reserve 

In the System’s early years, the decentralized structure gave the Reserve Banks 

considerable scope to make independent decisions that applied to their own Districts, 

which made it difficult to effect policy.  For example, one Bank’s purchases of securities 

could be offset by another Bank’s sale, given that the market for securities was national 

                                                 
13 Directors are chosen, according to Sections 4(11) and 4(12) of the Federal Reserve Act, “with due but not 
exclusive consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers” 
(see Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. § 302 as amended by an act of Nov. 16, 1977 (91 Stat. 1388), 
paragraphs on class B and class C directors, https://www.federalreserve.gov/aboutthefed/section4.htm). 
14 Authors Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell write, “Throughout much of American history there has been a 
deep and abiding mistrust of bankers and a widespread fear of a ‘money monopoly’--a fear that those 
needing to borrow would be taken advantage of by those able to lend.  Such questions had figured 
prominently in the debates over the fates of the First Bank and Second Bank of the United States, and they 
played a role in the popular support of free banking legislation.  They had also led to the almost universal 
adoption of usury ceilings on interest rates (typically 6 percent) that were more honored in name than 
reality.  These concerns were the subject of congressional inquiries, the most famous of which were the 
Pujo hearings into the Money Trust in the wake of the 1907 panic.”  See Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell

Norton), p. 510.  See also Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz (1963), A Monetary History of the 
United States, 1867-1960 (Princeton, N.J.:  Princeton University Press), p. 48.

in scope.  As a result, the Reserve Banks created a committee to coordinate these “open 

market operations.”  But in these years, the Reserve Banks were not bound by that 

committee’s decisions and could derail any attempt at coordinated action. 

This decentralization was thought by some to have undermined the Federal 

Reserve’s response to the Great Depression.16  With that experience in mind, the 1935 

Banking Act modified the distribution of power within the Federal Reserve System, 

giving the Board of Governors 7 of the 12 seats on the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) (figure 10).17  The other 5 seats are held by the Reserve Banks.  The Federal 

Reserve Bank of New York has a permanent seat, and the other Reserve Banks share the 

remaining 4 seats on a rotating basis.18  While FOMC members are free to dissent from 

the majority decision about open market operations, the Reserve Banks are nevertheless 

required to adhere to that decision in conducting open market operations. 

The structure set out in 1935 has been essentially unchanged to this day and has 

served the country well.  As intended by the framers, the federal nature of the system has 

ensured a diversity of views and promotes a healthy debate over policy.  My strong view 

is that this institutionalized diversity of thinking is a strength of our System.  In my 

experience, the best outcomes are reached when opposing viewpoints are clearly and 

strongly presented before decisions are made.

Kluwer Academic), pp. 241-74. 
17 The FOMC was created by the Banking Act of 1933 but was restructured in 1935 to include members of 
the Board of Governors. 
18 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York was made a permanent member of the FOMC in 1942.  From 
1935 to 1942, it alternated annually with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston as a member.

Members of the Board of Governors and Presidents of the Reserve Banks arrive at 

their own independent viewpoints about the economy and the appropriate path for 

monetary policy. Congress has assigned the FOMC the task of achieving stable prices 

and maximum employment; however, policymakers may disagree on the best way to 

achieve those goals.19  The System’s structure encourages exploration of a diverse range 

of views and promotes a healthy policy debate.20  In the modern Federal Reserve System, 

each Reserve Bank has an independent research department, with its own external 

publications.  In addition, while the members of the Board tend to focus on developments 

in the nation as a whole, the Reserve Bank Presidents bring specialized information about 

their regional economies to the FOMC discussion.  Before each FOMC meeting, Reserve 

Bank Presidents consult with their staff of economists as well as their boards of directors, 

business contacts in their Districts, and market experts to develop their independent 

views of appropriate monetary policy. 

The FOMC works to achieve a consensus policy by blending inputs from the 

members of the Board of Governors and from the Reserve Bank Presidents under the 

leadership of its Chair.  By tradition, the Chair of the Board has been chosen as the Chair 

of the FOMC and has had a central role in setting the agenda for the FOMC and 

developing consensus among the Committee’s members.  In addition, the Chair is the 

most visible public face of the Federal Reserve System.

The Fed is accountable to Congress and the public for its activities and decisions.  

Historically, the activities of central banks were shrouded in mystery.  Montagu Norman, 

the famously secretive Governor of the Bank of England from 1920 to 1944, reportedly 

took as his personal motto, “Never explain, never excuse” (figure 11).21 

In the modern era, all that has changed, as central banks have come to see 

transparency both as a requirement of democratic accountability and as a way of 

supporting the efficacy of their policies.  Over recent decades the Fed has significantly 

augmented its public communications, as have other major central banks.  The Chair 

testifies before Congress twice each year about the U.S. economy and the FOMC’s 

monetary policy in pursuit of its statutory goals of stable prices and maximum 

employment (figure 12).22  The Federal Reserve Board prepares a Monetary Policy 

Report to accompany that testimony.23  The Chair also holds press conferences after four 

FOMC meetings each year.   The FOMC releases statements after its meetings that 

explain the economic outlook and the rationale for its policy decision.  Detailed minutes 

of the Committee’s meetings are published three weeks later.24  Since 2007, FOMC 

participants have submitted quarterly macroeconomic projections that are published in 

the Summary of Economic Projections.25  In 2012, the FOMC issued a Statement on 

                                                 
21 Ben Bernanke, former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, referenced the motto in a 2007 speech.

Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed every January.  

This statement discusses the Committee’s interpretation of its statutory goals of 

maximum employment and price stability; it indicates that the Committee judges 

inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures, to be most consistent over the longer run with the Federal 

Reserve’s statutory mandate.26  Transcripts of FOMC meetings are released to the public 

after a delay of about five years. 

Federal Reserve Board Governors and Reserve Bank Presidents contribute to the 

Federal Reserve’s transparency with frequent public speeches and other communications.  

I believe that support for the Federal Reserve as a public institution is sustained by the 

public expression of our diverse views.27 

These communications with Congress and the public are critical parts of the 

Federal Reserve’s institutional accountability and transparency, and are essential 

complements to its independence.  It is important that Federal Reserve officials regularly 

demonstrate that the Fed has been appropriately pursuing its mandated goals.  

Transparency can also make monetary policy more effective by helping to guide the 

public’s expectations and clarify the Committee’s policy intentions.

Recent Changes in Federal Reserve System Governance 

In recent years, the governance of the Federal Reserve System has continued to 

evolve. The 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

provided that directors representing financial institutions--the class A directors, of which 

there are three on each Reserve Bank board--may not participate in the appointment of 

Reserve Bank presidents and first vice presidents.  The Federal Reserve Board has long 

had policies preventing Reserve Bank directors from participating in supervisory matters 

or in determining the appointment of any Reserve Bank officer whose primary duties 

involve supervisory matters.  These directors continue to provide highly valuable 

information about developments in their markets, and take part fully in other roles with 

the other six directors. 

Another aspect of governance involves the better representation of women and 

minorities in the Federal Reserve System.  Indeed, while I have focused my remarks on 

the history of geographical diversity in the Federal Reserve System, we also strive to 

have diversity in gender and race both at the Board and at the Reserve Banks.  In recent 

years, the Reserve Banks’ boards of directors have made significant progress along these 

lines.  Women now account for 34 percent of the directors, up from 24 percent five years 

ago.  In addition, minorities now account for 29 percent of directors, up from 19 percent 

five years ago. 

Conclusion 

The long history of political discourse in the United States helps explain the 

Federal Reserve’s unique structure, in which the Board of Governors in Washington and 

the 12 regional Reserve Banks share power over monetary policy (as shown in figure 1).  


 - 14 - 

Throughout our history, Americans have questioned the structure and even, at times, the 

need for a central bank.  Current discussions of Fed reforms echo these past debates.  But 

it is important to understand that history in both advanced and emerging economies 

across the world has consistently demonstrated the need for a central bank, and both the 

existence and the structure of the Federal Reserve are products of that historical 

experience.  Our structure is fundamentally a compromise, shaped by American history 

stretching back to the first Bank of the United States and, later, by the lessons of the 

Great Depression.  It is designed to deliver the United States a vitally needed central bank 

in a country that has had a long-standing aversion to centralized power over monetary 

and financial affairs.  It preserves diverse regional voices while ensuring that policy can 

be implemented through a cooperative consensus.  The balance between national and 

regional interests is critical to the spirit of the original compromise that created the 

Federal Reserve, and to its democratic legitimacy.  The structure achieves a practical 

balance that should not be changed lightly, as it continues to serve the country well.
