Let me begin by noting that my comments today will not address the timing of 

liftoff for the federal funds rate.1 

Recent months have seen increased anticipation of the normalization of monetary 

policy in the United States.  Many observers interpret normalization to mean a tightening 

cycle similar in pace to previous cycles, such as those from 1994 to 1995 and from 2004 

to 2007, with the effect of returning interest rates to the level viewed as normal in the 

decades before the crisis.  The Federal Reserve describes normalization as “steps to raise 

the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates to more normal levels.”2  But 

what do we mean by “more normal levels”?  A broad deterioration in foreign growth 

prospects, together with greater risk sensitivity in the wake of the crisis and changes in 

the rate of potential output growth, may be contributing to a “new normal.”  The new 

normal is likely to be characterized by a lower level of interest rates than in the decades 

preceding the crisis, which counsels a cautious and gradual approach to adjusting 

monetary policy.  

The Benchmark Neutral Rate 

The appropriate pace and target for normalizing monetary policy depend centrally 

on understanding the neutral rate of interest.  The nominal neutral interest rate is the level 

of the federal funds rate that is consistent with output growing close to its potential rate 

with full employment and stable inflation.3  The appropriate benchmark for assessing the 

stance of monetary policy is the gap between the policy rate and the nominal neutral rate

savings are equilibrated at full employment--is originally attributed to Swedish economist Knut Wicksell.

of interest:  When the federal funds rate is below the nominal neutral rate, monetary 

policy is accommodative, and, when it is above the neutral rate, policy is contractionary.  

For this reason, many monetary policy rules, such as the well-known Taylor rule, 

incorporate an estimate of the neutral real interest rate as a critical parameter along with 

the target rate of inflation.4 

Although the neutral rate is a critical benchmark for monetary policy, it changes 

over time in response to important changes in economic conditions, necessitating 

corresponding adjustments in monetary policy in order to restore the economy to full 

employment.  For instance, when there are modest adverse shocks to demand that lead to 

modest reductions in the shorter-run neutral rate, monetary policy can provide enough 

support to keep the economy at full employment simply by reducing the policy rate 

commensurate with the decline in the nominal neutral rate.  However, when the adverse 

shocks to demand are sufficiently severe to push the nominal neutral interest rate 

substantially below zero, as they were during the Great Recession, monetary policy 

confronts the zero-lower-bound constraint, at which point the federal funds rate cannot 

fall low enough to provide the necessary degree of accommodation without becoming 

negative.  This was the case in the United States for several years following the crisis and 

remains true today in a number of advanced foreign economies.  That is why monetary 

policymakers in the United States and several other major economies have been 

compelled to use additional unconventional tools to promote full employment and target 

inflation, such as forward guidance and asset purchases.

The neutral rate of interest is not directly observable, but we can back out an 

estimate of the neutral rate by relying on the observation that output should grow faster 

relative to potential growth the lower the federal funds rate is relative to the nominal 

neutral rate.  In today’s circumstances, the fact that the U.S. economy is growing at a 

pace only modestly above potential while core inflation remains restrained suggests that 

the nominal neutral rate may not be far above the nominal federal funds rate, even now.  

In fact, various econometric estimates of the level of the neutral rate, or similar concepts, 

are consistent with the low levels suggested by this simple heuristic approach.5   

The Past and Future Neutral Rate 

In assessing the policy path ahead, the critical question is whether a low neutral 

rate is likely to be a “new normal” in the longer run or whether the neutral rate is soon 

likely to increase back to levels considered normal in the decades before the crisis.  To 

answer this question, it is helpful to use economic forecasts, market-implied expectations, 

and econometric models to assess where real interest rates are expected to be in the 

longer run, and compare them with the levels that prevailed in the decades before the 

crisis.  In doing so, it is important to abstract from shocks that are transitory or cyclical 

and thus likely to fade away over a year or two.6 

Starting with economic forecasts, Blue Chip Forecasts publishes projections of 

the federal funds rate and consumer price index (CPI) inflation 6 to 10 years into the 

future, when the economy is typically expected to be near full employment.  The implied 

Blue Chip consensus longer-run real federal funds rate averaged around 2.2 percent in the 

                                                 
5 See, for example, Cúrdia (2015) and Del Negro and others (2015). 
6 Hamilton and others (2015) use moving averages of real rates as their measure of the equilibrium real 
rate.  Using a similar measure, in the United States, the 11-year moving average of the short-term real 
interest rate is now at its lowest level since the beginning of the series in the late 1950s.

two decades preceding the crisis, which is close to the level of the intercept term in the 

Taylor (1993) rule, which in turn is based on empirical analysis of the period from the 

mid-1980s to the early 1990s.  In contrast, the Blue Chip consensus longer-run rate is 

currently around 1.1 percent, about 1 percentage point lower than the pre-crisis average.7   

Similarly, although the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has not 

explicitly defined “normal,” the central tendency or the median of the longer-run level of 

the federal funds rate in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) might reasonably 

be considered a rough proxy.  By this proxy, forecasts of the neutral rate have moved 

down noticeably over the past several years. The median projection of the longer-run 

level of the real federal funds rate was 2-1/4 percent in January 2012, when projections of 

the longer-run federal funds rate were first included in the SEP.  By comparison, the 

median projection for the longer-run real federal funds rate had fallen by 3/4 percentage 

point to 1-1/2 percent in the most recent SEP.8 

Market measures of expected forward rates evidence a similar decline.  For 

example, we can back out an implied 1-year real rate 10 years from now from the 

Treasury inflation-protected securities, or TIPS, yield curve.  The most recent readings 

are around 1.3 percent, close to 2 percentage points below the average rate from 1999 

through 2007.  Swaps prices tell a similar story.  The implied expected 1-year real rate 10 

years from now is currently close to 1 percent, again well below levels prior to the 

financial crisis. 

                                                 
7 Here the longer-run real rate is defined as the consensus longer-run nominal federal funds rate minus the 
consensus longer-run rate of CPI inflation.  Because most forecasts of economic conditions far into the 
future are predicated on the economy being at full employment, forecasts of relatively low actual real rates 
are consistent with forecasts of relatively low neutral rates. 
8 In the SEP, longer-run projections represent each participant’s assessment of the rate to which each 
variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further 
shocks to the economy.

Finally, some of the econometric models used to estimate the current neutral rate, 

or closely related concepts, can also be used to assess whether low neutral rates are likely 

to persist.  While estimates will depend on the model specification, several models 

estimate that the neutral rate will remain low for some time to come.  Laubach and 

Williams, for example, estimate that the natural rate, a concept closely related to the 

neutral rate, likely will remain near zero for the foreseeable future.9 

Why Is the Neutral Rate Low? 

With a variety of estimates suggesting that the neutral rate of interest is likely to 

remain low relative to historical norms for some time, it is important to assess the 

underlying causes and their likely persistence.  There are a host of factors that could lead 

the neutral rate to remain depressed in the longer run--ranging from the low level of 

world real interest rates, which affects the United States via the exchange rate and 

financial market channels, to slow-moving secular trends in the labor force and 

productivity, to persistent changes in risk perceptions stemming from the crisis. 

Although tight domestic credit conditions and concerns about downside risks to 

asset prices and domestic demand were the dominant drivers early in the recovery, the 

foreign outlook has become increasingly important as a source of downward pressure on 

the neutral rate in the past few years.  In addition to concerns about weak demand in 

Japan and the euro area, more recently foreign growth concerns have broadened to 

include China, which is navigating difficult structural as well as cyclical adjustments.  

The financial reverberations from China are adversely affecting commodity exporters and 

                                                 
9 Laubach and Williams define the natural rate as “the real short-term interest rate consistent with the 
economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate supply or demand have abated” 
(2015, p. 2).

emerging markets more broadly, and weak growth trajectories are now the norm in much 

of the world, pushing down interest rates globally.   

The broad-based reduction in interest rates in the rest of the world, by increasing 

demand for U.S. assets, puts upward pressure on the dollar, which in turn implies 

downward pressure on the U.S. neutral rate.  One way to think about the spillover from 

abroad is how much adjustment in the federal funds rate might be necessary to insulate 

domestic employment from an appreciation in the dollar that is expected to persist.  Let’s 

take the roughly 15 percent real appreciation of the dollar that we have seen since June 

2014.  According to the Board’s FRB/US model, it would require lowering the path of 

the federal funds rate by roughly 1 percentage point over the medium term to insulate 

domestic employment from the 15 percent stronger exchange rate in inflation adjusted 

terms.  In the neighborhood of the zero lower bound, this shift down implies a delay in 

the date of liftoff and a shallower path for the federal funds rate over several years.  In 

effect, this spillover from abroad implies some limitations on the extent to which U.S. 

monetary conditions can diverge from global conditions. 

Going forward, many observers expect global growth to stabilize and eventually 

move higher, easing pressure on the dollar and on commodity prices and leading to a 

higher neutral interest rate globally.10  However, as foreign economies face structural as 

well as cyclical adjustments, the speed at which the stabilization and recovery of foreign 

growth takes place is highly uncertain, and there is a risk that this influence on the neutral 

rate could fade very slowly.  Moreover, there are downside risks to the foreign outlook. 

                                                 
10 See, for example, chapter 1 of the IMF World Economic Outlook (2015).

Other factors likely pushing down the current neutral rate may prove even more 

persistent.  Importantly, expectations that the economy’s growth potential has fallen 

could contribute to a persistent decline in the neutral rate.  Indeed, there is evidence that 

growth in the labor force, and perhaps productivity, have slowed persistently in recent 

years.  After increasing noticeably over much of the post-World War II period, the labor 

force participation rate flattened out over the 1990s and began to decline in the early 

2000s as the baby boom generation approached retirement.  Most recently, the pace of 

decline has quickened, with the participation rate declining 1/2 percent per year, on 

average, over the recovery.11  Productivity growth has also slowed, averaging just 

1 percent per year over the recovery, about half the pace over the 50 years prior to the 

financial crisis.12  Given this data, the Congressional Budget Office now estimates that 

the growth rate of potential output is only 1.7 percent currently, less than half the rate 

during the 50 years before 2008.  Nevertheless, although there is evidence of a 

connection between low potential output growth and a low neutral rate, as pointed out by 

Hamilton and others, the relationship is not precisely estimated, which leaves 

considerable uncertainty about the magnitude of the effect.13 

Finally, investors’ risk sensitivity appears to have been altered by the experience 

of tail risks during the crisis, which could have a persistent depressing effect on the 

                                                 
11 Population growth has also moved gradually lower in the United States, though the effect has not been as 
large as in some foreign economies, where the size of the population is now stagnant or falling.   
12 It is unclear how persistent recent low rates of measured productivity growth will be.  While weak 
investment levels, particularly early on in the recovery, likely contributed to lower productivity gains, 
investment levels going forward could be closer to historical norms.  Also, recent technological gains may 
eventually contribute strongly to productivity growth; see, for example, Baily, Manyika, and Gupta (2013).  
In addition, there is evidence that some of the contribution of technology gains to productivity growth is 
being understated; see, for example, Byrne and Pinto (2015), Byrne and Corrado (2015), and Byrne, Oliner 
and Sichel (2015).  
13 See Hamilton and others (2015).

neutral rate.  To the extent that investors or firms are more attuned to the risks associated 

with capital investments than before the financial crisis, it increases the premium for 

risky investments, or the difference in return between a risk-free investment, such as 

overnight reserves, and somewhat riskier investment opportunities.  A higher risk 

premium necessitates a lower risk-free rate to encourage the same amount of riskier 

investments as previously.  Consistent with this explanation, there is evidence that the 

gap between the return to capital investment and the risk free rate has risen.  For example, 

according to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models estimated by the Federal 

Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the natural rate of interest 

has been held down during the recovery by shocks that increase the difference between 

the marginal product of capital and the risk free rate, pushing down investment and 

reducing the level of capital.14  In addition, a simple measure of the marginal product of 

capital suggests that the return to capital investment has not changed very much, or 

perhaps has even increased, over the past decade despite the decline in risk free rates.15 

Implications for the Path of Monetary Policy 

Before addressing what a persistently low neutral interest rate might mean for the 

normalization of monetary policy, it is helpful to review inflation developments.  Because 

the federal funds rate is the real rate plus the expected rate of inflation and because it is 

the real rate that influences economic activity, the amount of monetary accommodation 

represented by a given nominal level of the federal funds rate decreases as expected 

inflation declines.  In a low neutral rate environment, it is especially important to guard 

                                                 
14 See Del Negro and others (2015).  In these models, the natural rate of interest is defined as the “rate of 
interest that would obtain if all prices and wages had adjusted so as to bring the level of economic activity 
to its full-employment rate.” 
15 See Gomme, Ravikumar, and Rupert (2015).

against extended periods of below-target inflation, which may lead inflation expectations 

to drift lower. 

 It is thus notable that inflation has been below our 2 percent target for 3 years.   

Current below-target levels of inflation in part reflect disinflationary pressures from 

abroad, including lower import prices and lower commodity prices, which are likely to 

fade over time.  However, inflation has been stubbornly low, even excluding energy 

prices.  Over the 12 months ending in October, core personal consumption expenditures, 

or PCE, prices, which exclude the often volatile categories of food and energy, increased 

1.3 percent, and the 12-month change in core prices has been around 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 

percent since the beginning of 2013.  The persistent weakness in core price inflation 

deserves continued vigilance.  

In determining the outlook for inflation, the gravitational force of long-term 

inflation expectations is especially important.  Some survey measures of inflation 

expectations have declined recently.  For example, the University of Michigan Surveys of 

Consumers median measure of inflation expectations at a 5-to-10 year horizon was 2.6 

percent in November and has averaged 2.7 percent over the past year, slightly below the 

average reading over the past decade of 2.9 percent.  Projections from the Survey of 

Professional Forecasters also suggest that 10-year-ahead inflation expectations edged 

lower this quarter, although they have remained at or very near 2 percent since the end of 

2012.   

Market-based measures of inflation compensation at longer-term horizons, such 

as inflation swaps and the difference between nominal and inflation-indexed Treasury 

bond yields, have declined more noticeably over the past year and a half.  Although it is 


 - 10 - 

difficult to precisely disentangle the contribution of changes in inflation expectations, 

liquidity premiums, and inflation risk premiums to this downward shift, some 

decompositions suggest that, while expected inflation may not have declined much, 

market participants may be placing a somewhat greater likelihood than previously on 

episodes of below-potential growth being accompanied by below-target inflation.  Thus, 

the decline in measures of inflation expectations warrants close monitoring.   

The slow progress on inflation, together with the likely low level of the longer-

term neutral real rate and the slow pace at which the very low shorter-term rate may 

move to the longer-term rate, suggest that the federal funds rate is likely to adjust more 

gradually and to a lower level than in previous expansions.  In short, “gradual and low” is 

likely to be the new normal.   

In addition, the combination of a low neutral real rate with slow progress on 

inflation suggests a greater likelihood of hitting the zero lower bound than in previous 

decades, when the neutral rate was probably much higher.  The lower the longer-term 

nominal neutral rate is, the smaller in magnitude an adverse economic shock must be to 

push growth sufficiently below potential to necessitate a nominal federal funds rate below 

zero to provide accommodation.  Assuming there has not been a material reduction in the 

frequency and severity of negative shocks since the pre-crisis period, the implication is 

that the probability of being constrained by the zero lower bound is greater than prior to 

the crisis.   

Although empirical analysis suggests that unconventional tools affect the 

economy through the same channels as the federal funds rate, even so, there are greater 

costs and uncertainties associated with unconventional policies relative to changes in the 


 - 11 - 

federal funds rate. 16  As a result, policy is likely to remain more constrained at the zero 

lower bound than above it.  As the probability of hitting the zero lower bound increases, 

the asymmetry in policy flexibility becomes more pronounced.  Because we have more 

space to respond by raising rates if inflationary forces accelerate than by cutting rates if 

disinflationary forces emerge, when nominal neutral rates are likely to be lower on 

average, we should be cautious about raising rates, do so gradually, and carefully assess 

the effects on economic and financial conditions as we go.  Moreover, because the 

Federal Reserve’s asset holdings help maintain accommodative financial conditions, it 

would be prudent to maintain reinvestments until the normalization of the federal funds 

rate is sufficiently far along to allow room to cut nominal rates if economic conditions 

deteriorate. 

The asymmetry of policy flexibility at the zero lower bound also arises when 

there is uncertainty about the level of the neutral real rate.  As discussed in recent papers, 

if there is significant uncertainty about the level of the neutral real rate, risk management 

considerations suggest that policymakers should respond cautiously to signs that the 

neutral real rate may be rising, particularly when the policy rate is close to the zero lower 

bound.17  In the presence of uncertainty, there is a risk that the actual neutral real rate is 

either higher or lower than current estimates of the neutral real rate, and the stance of 

policy will therefore be either more accommodative or more restrictive than intended.  If 

the actual neutral rate is higher than estimated, and policy is more accommodative than 

intended, the stance of policy can be readily tightened later to restrain any buildup in 

inflationary pressures.  But, if the actual neutral real rate is lower than estimated, and the

 - 12 - 

stance of monetary policy is tighter than intended, unexpected policy restraint may prove 

difficult to offset later with more accommodative policy because the policy rate is already 

close to the zero lower bound. 

Finally, there is a risk that with persistently lower neutral rates, there may be 

greater pressures for investors to reach for yield, increasing the demand for risky assets.  

As a result, macroprudential policy may take on greater importance to guard against 

financial stability risks.  Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other regulatory 

agencies have implemented a number of new rules to strengthen capital, liquidity, and 

risk management at the largest financial institutions.  Many of these rules are “through 

the cycle” safeguards, meaning that they impose structurally higher standards.  In 

addition, when the risks to financial stability increase, the Federal Reserve, in 

consultation with the other banking agencies, can temporarily increase the amount of 

capital that large banks are required to hold in order to build resilience at these 

institutions and to restrain undue risk-taking on a cyclical basis.   

Conclusion 

A variety of evidence suggests that the longer-run neutral rate is lower now than it 

has been historically, and that the very low shorter-run neutral rate may adjust to it very 

slowly, due to a combination of weaker foreign demand growth, greater risk sensitivity as 

a result of the crisis, higher risk premiums for productive investment, and lower growth 

in potential output.  The lower neutral rate means the normalization of the federal funds 

rate is likely to follow a more gradual and shallower path than in previous cycles, 

although the actual path will be determined by economic conditions.  It also implies that 

the likelihood of the federal funds rate hitting the zero lower bound will be persistently 


 - 13 - 

greater than it has been previously, which could make it more difficult to achieve our 

objectives of full employment and 2 percent inflation.  With the nominal neutral interest 

rate lower than in the past, and with policy options being more limited if conditions 

deteriorate than if inflationary pressures accelerate, the asymmetry in risk-management 

considerations counsels a cautious and gradual approach.
