May 14, 2015 
 



Good morning.  I am delighted to join you here today to discuss the state of 

community banking and issues of importance to community banks like yours.1  New York 

may be home to Wall Street, but, just like the rest of the country, most of the banks in the 

Second District are community banks.  There are more than 170 banking organizations 

here with less than $10 billion in assets, serving millions of customers. 

Community banks play an essential role in our financial system, supporting the 

economic health and vitality of the communities you serve.  Unlike many of your larger 

competitors, community banks offer customers face-to-face interaction with a local banker 

who has the authority to make the final decision on a loan--a banker with a long-term 

investment in the community who will not be moving to another branch in a new town 

within a few years.  Community bankers benefit from local knowledge and relationships 

that often lead to more successful and efficient lending decisions.  These advantages have 

enabled many community banks in the Second District and around the country to maintain 

or increase their local market shares while competing with larger regional and money 

center banks, and I expect that they will continue to do so. 

Nonetheless, community banks face significant challenges today.  The number of 

community banks has declined significantly over the past decade.  The Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation’s “Problem List” of at-risk banks has declined from 888 at the peak 

of the financial crisis to 291 at the end of 2014, but that is still well above typical pre-

crisis levels of fewer than 100. There are several factors driving consolidation and 

elevating the number of problem banks, beyond the lasting effects of the recession.  For 

starters, community banks have been challenged in some of your traditional product lines

Reserve System.

by competition from larger financial institutions that can achieve lower costs through 

economies of scale.  At the same time, historically thin net interest margins have 

constrained profitability, and, although not aimed at community banks, new post-crisis 

regulations meant to strengthen the financial system are coming into place that require 

additional management attention. 

The Federal Reserve recognizes the importance of a healthy community banking 

sector for our nation’s prosperity, and we are committed to understanding the challenges 

faced by community banks and to carefully considering the effects of new regulations on 

these institutions.  Our mandate is to protect the safety and soundness of the nation’s 

financial system, and we aim to do so in a manner that promotes a level playing field for 

all institutions while taking into account the risks those institutions could pose to our 

financial system.  As you know, the Federal Reserve tiers its regulations to be 

commensurate with the risks presented by different institutions.  The risks presented by an 

institution with $300 million in assets are very different from those presented by an 

institution with $300 billion in assets.  Although the credit that a community bank extends 

to households and businesses within its local area may be difficult to replace, the failure of 

a community bank would not cause a widespread contraction in credit or have any other 

systemic consequences.  For that reason, community banks are not subject to the same 

regulations that are applied to the most systemically important banking organizations. 

The Federal Reserve’s 2013 capital guidelines are a good example of how we have 

taken into account the effect of our regulations on community banks.  The recession made 

it clear that strong capital positions are essential for banks of all sizes, including 

community banks.  After issuing our proposed guidelines, we received considerable input 


 - 3 - 

from community bankers helping us to identify which portions of our original proposal 

were, and were not, appropriate for community banks.  Based on this input, we made some 

significant adjustments to the proposal to alter, for example, the risk-weighting of 

mortgage loans and the regulatory capital treatment of certain unrealized gains and losses 

and trust preferred securities for community banking organizations.  Regulators also 

developed a community bank guide, which outlined the relevant provisions for smaller, 

noncomplex institutions and compared the new requirements to the previous standards.2   

In addition, the Federal Reserve Board recently issued a final rule raising the limit 

on the maximum size of banks covered by our Small Bank Holding Company Statement.3  

This policy statement, originally issued in 1980, fosters local ownership of small 

community banks.  While the Board generally discourages the use of debt by bank holding 

companies to finance acquisitions, it recognizes that the limited access small institutions 

have to equity funding means that such firms often must rely on acquisition debt to 

accomplish a transfer of ownership.  The policy statement allows small, noncomplex bank 

holding companies to temporarily operate with higher levels of debt than would otherwise 

be permitted.  It also exempts them from the Board’s risk-based and leverage capital 

guidelines and eliminates some regulatory reporting requirements.  Of course, regulatory

capital requirements will continue to apply to the depository institution subsidiaries of 

these companies.   

The policy statement originally applied only to qualifying holding companies with 

no more than $150 million in total consolidated assets.  In 2006, the maximum asset size 

was raised to $500 million.  Significant changes in the structure of the banking industry 

since 2006 led Board members to believe that a further increase in the limit to $1 billion in 

assets should be considered.  However, because of limitations imposed by the Collins 

Amendment to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board could not raise the limit without further 

statutory action.  We are very pleased that the Congress passed legislation in December 

2014 that enabled the Board to raise the limit.  The policy statement now covers nearly 90 

percent of bank holding companies.   

The Volcker rule and incentive compensation are two additional areas where I 

believe relief for smaller institutions would be helpful.  The risks identified by the Dodd-

Frank Act in these areas apply almost exclusively to larger financial institutions.  

Community banks rarely engage in any of the activities prohibited by the Volcker rule, 

and community banks generally do not face the adverse incentives of compensation 

agreements that may encourage executives and loan officers to maximize lending volume 

at the expense of safety and soundness.  I believe community banks should not face 

significant burdens from complying with these requirements, so I support raising the asset 

threshold for both the Volcker rule and incentive compensation rules, perhaps to 

$10 billion.  In the event where the actions of a community bank might raise concerns in 

either of these areas, that could be addressed through our normal examination process.  


 - 5 - 

The Board has undertaken substantial efforts to tailor its supervisory practices to 

the size of the bank examined.  We supervise banks in four tiers, with requirements that 

are lowest for smaller, local institutions and increase with the size, complexity, and 

geographic reach of firms.  This system helps community banks by eliminating 

requirements that are relevant only to large, geographically diversified banks.  This tiered 

approach allows us to account for the differences in business models and risk levels 

among different types of banks.  Our goal is not to develop one state-of-the-art approach 

to regulation and supervision, but instead multiple state-of-the-art approaches that are 

appropriate for each type of institution we oversee.  Supervision of community banks is 

not a watered-down version of supervision of larger banks, but a significantly different 

process tailored to the business model of smaller banks. 

For community banks, the primary purpose of prudential regulation is to ensure the 

safety and soundness of each individual institution, thereby protecting the deposit 

insurance fund.  The crisis showed that such a focus on individual institutions was 

inadequate to account for and contain the systemic threats posed by risks at larger, more 

complex institutions, and much of the improvement in oversight has been directed at 

systemic risk.  The Board is committed to making sure that new supervisory standards do 

not trickle down to community banks when they may only be appropriate for larger 

institutions, whether they be systemically important institutions overseen by the Large 

Institution Supervision Coordination Committee, other large banking organizations with 

more than $50 billion in assets, or regional banking organizations with between 

$10 billion and $50 billion in assets.4

www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/large-institution-supervision.htm.

For example, the Board has made it clear that capital stress tests and other aspects 

of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review requirements do not apply to 

community banks, either explicitly or implicitly.  In addition to Board members making 

this point in public speeches and in meetings with bankers, the Federal Reserve’s 

examiner training emphasizes that these requirements, which were established under the 

Dodd-Frank Act, will apply only to large banking organizations.  

The Fed also made changes in 2014 to better tailor our program of consumer 

compliance supervision of smaller institutions.  Under the new approach, the intensity of 

bank examinations is based on our assessment of the risk profile of individual community 

banks, including how each identifies and manages consumer compliance risk.  Risk 

assessment begins before examiners arrive at the bank, allowing examiners to focus on 

higher-risk concerns at the banks they supervise.  We have also directed examiners to 

spend less time on those areas of consumer compliance where problems are uncommon, 

although we are ready to ramp up that scrutiny if we have concerns about practices at a 

particular institution.   

Since making these changes 16 months ago, the average length of time for 

examinations has dropped, and the feedback we have heard from you is mostly positive.  

Bankers have told us that the examiners seem to have a better grasp of the key issues and 

that exams are, as we intended, more closely tailored to the business characteristics and 

risk profile of individual institutions.  Examiners also tell us they sometimes see increased 

consumer compliance risk at community banks that are expanding beyond their traditional 

product offerings, often using outside vendors to introduce new products such as prepaid 

cards or credit card add-ons.  These products are often complex, and community banks 


 - 7 - 

may not always be familiar with the risks the products pose.  Banks may not have 

sufficient expertise to thoroughly check out a vendor and monitor its performance.   

Beyond consumer compliance supervision, the Federal Reserve has expanded our 

ability to conduct more of the work of bank examinations off site.  If banks have 

electronic loan records, it is possible for examiners to assess loan quality and underwriting 

practices remotely, spending much less time on site.  This approach has the potential to 

improve examination efficiency and to reduce the examination-related disruption to 

banking operations.  However, if banks prefer more face-to-face interaction with 

examiners--and there are banks that do--we will continue the traditional on-site review. 

Our efforts to further tailor bank supervision at community banks continue.  Staff 

members from the Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are working through a major review of regulations 

called for in the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA).  

We are still in the midst of this effort, which is being conducted with a broad mandate to 

identify and revise where possible outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome 

regulations, including those that apply to community banks.  The agencies are carefully 

considering public comments.  Although some burden-reducing measures may require 

congressional action, the agencies will act to implement regulatory relief when possible 

before the end of the EGRPRA review period.  The results of our EGRPRA review will be 

included in the agencies’ joint report to the Congress. 

In addition, the Federal Reserve System has expanded our economic research into 

issues of consequence to community banks and has worked to encourage similar research 

efforts at academic institutions.  Several years ago, a group of economists from across the 


 - 8 - 

System formed an informal working group to share ongoing research related to 

community banking.  Encouraging results from this internal forum led, in 2013, to an 

inaugural research and policy conference titled “Community Banking in the 21st 

Century,” sponsored jointly by the Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State 

Bank Supervisors.  The conference provided a unique opportunity for researchers, 

community bankers, and bank supervisors to come together to hear some of the latest 

research on topics related to community banking and discuss the practical implications of 

this research.  The 2013 conference was so successful that we decided to make it an 

annual event.  The third annual conference will take place this coming fall at the Federal 

Reserve Bank of St. Louis, and Chair Yellen is scheduled to provide opening remarks.   

I had the pleasure of participating in the first two conferences and found the 

presentations and conversations to be extremely enlightening.  Many of the researchers 

who presented at these conferences said that the feedback they received from bankers and 

bank supervisors was valuable in helping them shape their future research endeavors.  The 

conference organizing committee has launched a new website with the URL 

“www.communitybanking.org,” which they hope will become a focal point for all who are 

interested in community banking research.  The website provides links to the papers and 

presentations from the previous conferences, news about future conference plans, and 

other information that might be of interest to community banking researchers.   

Although research is an important avenue for improving our understanding of the 

community bank business model and the effects of changing market and regulatory 

conditions on the viability of that model, understanding is further enhanced through direct 


 - 9 - 

interactions between regulators and community bankers.  For this reason, the Federal 

Reserve System has taken a number of steps to expand its outreach to community banks.  

As you probably know, in 2010 the Board created the Community Depository 

Institutions Advisory Council, which includes representatives from community banks, 

credit unions, and savings associations from each Federal Reserve District.5  The Board of 

Governors meets twice each year to hear the council’s valuable insights into the most 

pressing concerns of community bankers from across the country.  There is also a council 

for each of the 12 Reserve Banks, which meets regularly with its Reserve Bank leadership. 

We have taken other steps to improve communications with community bankers so 

that we may better explain our supervisory expectations for community banks and hear 

your concerns as well.  Our Reserve Banks have together developed a number of channels 

of communication with community banks over the years, and some of the most promising 

of those initiatives have been expanded nationwide.  Two programs, Ask the Fed and 

Outlook Live, have become quite popular with community bankers who are interested in 

learning more about timely financial or regulatory topics of interest to both bankers and 

supervisors.  Ask the Fed is a program for officials of state member banks, holding 

companies, and state bank commissioners.  Outlook Live is a webinar series led by 

Federal Reserve staff that serves as a companion to our quarterly publication, Consumer 

Compliance Outlook.6  Last year I participated in a webinar hosted by the Federal Reserve 

Bank of St. Louis and very much enjoyed hearing directly from community bankers.7

Another effort to improve communication with community bankers is our new 

Community Banking Connections website and quarterly newsletter.  These sources of 

information focus on safety-and-soundness issues that are of practical interest to 

community bankers and bank board members.  We have also launched a series of special-

purpose publications called Fed Links that highlight key elements of specific supervisory 

topics and discuss how examiners typically address the topic.8  The common goal of all of 

these outreach efforts is building and sustaining an ongoing dialogue with community 

bankers. 

Despite the challenges that you face, I firmly believe that community banks are 

here to stay.  Banks of different sizes serve different functions, and both large and small 

banks are needed to meet the funding needs of a healthy economy.  The Federal Reserve 

does not use a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation and supervision and is committed to 

continually reevaluating and improving oversight to meet the complementary goals of 

bank soundness, financial stability, and economic growth.  The risks and vulnerabilities of 

community banks differ substantially from those of larger banks, and an explicit tailoring 

of regulation and supervision for community banks is appropriate. 

I look forward to our discussion.
