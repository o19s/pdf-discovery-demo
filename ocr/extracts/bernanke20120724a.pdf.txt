Thank you very much for the opportunity to address you today.  I’m especially 

pleased as an economist and policymaker to discuss the importance of education to the 

success of our economy.  At the Federal Reserve we spend a lot of time looking at 

economic data, such as production and employment.  In doing so, we try never to forget 

that these seemingly sterile numbers are, in fact, reflections of the economic aspirations, 

opportunities, and well-being of millions of Americans.  When individuals are denied 

opportunities to reach their maximum potential, it harms not only those individuals, of 

course, but also the larger economy, which depends vitally on having a skilled, 

productive workforce.  As a result, we all have a stake in the essential work that you are 

doing for our children. 

 So how can we improve the opportunities for all children and give them a chance 

to succeed in our ever-changing, globalized economy?  As the husband of a teacher and 

an educator myself, as well as a parent and former school board member, I know from 

personal experience that, for creating opportunity and changing lives, there is no 

substitute for a quality education.  The research shows that effective educations lead to 

lower rates of poverty, higher lifetime earnings, and greater satisfaction on the job and at 

home.  And specialists in economic development have identified educational attainment 

as a key source of economic growth and rising incomes in many countries around the 

world.  

Although education and the acquisition of skills is a lifelong process, starting 

early in life is crucial.  Neuroscientists observe that if the first few years of a child’s life 

include support for healthy development in families and communities, the child is more 

likely to succeed in school and to contribute to society as an adult.  Conversely, without

support during these early years, a child is ultimately more likely to drop out of school, 

earn lower wages, depend on government programs, or be incarcerated.1 

Consistent with this research, early childhood education programs aim to nurture 

healthy development from the earliest years.  Programs that provide enriched experiences 

for children and that also involve parents have shown to benefit children from all 

backgrounds, but they have the strongest influence on children from disadvantaged 

environments.2  Importantly, state preschool assessments have shown that early 

childhood education programs make children better prepared for school, a precursor of 

future success.3   

The benefits of early childhood programs are not just short-term in nature.  

Careful studies demonstrate that early interventions can have a positive effect on young 

children from low-income families that lasts well into adulthood.  For example, analysis 

of one program showed that children who attended a high-quality half-day preschool 

program at ages 3 and 4 were, at age 40, more economically successful--for example, 

more likely to own their own homes--than nonparticipants in a control group.4  In other

evaluations, long-term benefits were demonstrated for a full-day early childhood 

education program starting before age 1 and for a nurse-based home visiting program.5 

 Economically speaking, early childhood programs are a good investment, with 

inflation-adjusted annual rates of return on the funds dedicated to these programs 

estimated to reach 10 percent or higher.6  Very few alternative investments can promise 

that kind of return.  Notably, a portion of these economic returns accrues to the children 

themselves and their families, but studies show that the rest of society enjoys the majority 

of the benefits, reflecting the many contributions that skilled and productive workers 

make to the economy.7  

The Federal Reserve has long supported increasing educational opportunity for 

children, including the youngest.  Federal Reserve Banks have published articles and 

convened community forums on early childhood issues.  For school-age children, we 

sponsor financial literacy and economic education programs.  For these programs, we 

make a special effort to reach schools with high proportions of minorities and lower-

income children.  

Many of you in the audience today are still in school or have recently graduated.

Children’s Defense Fund’s goal of a level educational playing field for all children.   

I wish you all the best in your conference and in your work.  Thank you.
