Thank you for the honor of sharing this award with such a worthy person, my 

friend and former colleague Ben Bernanke, and also for the honor of being associated 

with the exemplary life and legacy of Paul Douglas. 

Sen. Douglas’s contributions to ethics in government are an important aspect of 

that legacy, but since Ben and I are the first economists to win this award, I would also 

like to give due credit to Professor Douglas for his contributions to economics. 

 Working with the mathematician Charles Cobb, Douglas gathered data and 

created a statistical model that advanced economists’ understanding of the relative 

contributions to production made by capital and labor.  This work demonstrated many of 

the methods that economists would come to use and continue to use to this day.  Douglas 

constructed empirical measures of key economic concepts.  He then employed what were, 

for the time, advanced statistical techniques to analyze these data, thereby shedding light 

on a basic economic relationship.  As one recent commentator put it, work such as 

Douglas’s was part of “a growing literature , , , [that] played an important role in shaping 

the approach to combining statistical methods and economic theory that would become 

the standard econometric practice in the later decades of the 20th century.”1 

But, of course, Paul Douglas was much more than an economist.  From an early 

age, he always seemed to be the man in the middle, seen by the two sides of a dispute as 

intelligent, knowledgeable, and impartial enough to be trusted to seek a solution.  He 

mediated labor disputes and advised local government officials in Illinois.  He also 

helped governors in Pennsylvania and New York develop what became Social Security, 

unemployment insurance, and the idea of publicly owned power utilities.  After losing his

first election for the U.S. Senate in 1942, at the age of 49 he enlisted in the U.S. Marines 

and was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his service in the Pacific.  Later, 

after he was elected to the Senate, Douglas was a champion of consumer protection laws, 

including the 1968 Truth in Lending Act, and was a leading supporter of civil rights 

legislation.  

One of Paul Douglas’s most important achievements in public life was to promote 

ethics in government.  He was raised with a strong sense of right and wrong and was 

heavily influenced by the philosopher John Stuart Mill to believe that ethical behavior 

was also an eminently practical approach to life.  As a college professor, he entered 

public life in Chicago in the 1920s somewhat reluctantly to fight the spectacular political 

and commercial corruption that was strangling the city.  Once elected to office, he faced 

the challenge of how to act ethically when corruption was so universal that the city’s 

aldermen were expected to funnel large sums to their constituents, based on the 

presumption that all politicians were “on the take.”  If he refused bribes and then had no 

money to hand out, how would he convince people that he wasn’t simply refusing to 

share?   

The key was transparency and communication.  Everyone who asked for a large 

payment was handed a mimeographed statement titled “Please Help Me to Be an Honest 

Alderman.” At first, the public, inured to corruption, either disbelieved him or thought 

him a sucker for refusing to take bribes.  But over time, Douglas’s stand changed both the 

demands made by supplicants and his constituents’ expectations for ethical behavior by a 

government official.

Similarly, in 1939, Paul Douglas was one of the first public officials in America 

to publish a full accounting of his personal finances.  In his memoir, Douglas admits that 

this and other ethical rules he imposed on himself were often a nuisance and, in some 

cases, probably went further than needed to demonstrate his honesty.  But he believed 

that the public’s trust was so fundamental to the effectiveness of government that such 

steps were appropriate.  As a senator, he continued to publish his finances and observed 

strict limits on the value of personal gifts he received from those seeking benefits from 

him as a public official.  He strongly believed that these gift limits also made him more 

effective as a public servant, and he campaigned for legislation that ultimately led to the 

widespread requirement of financial disclosure and limits on accepting gifts.  

I share Paul Douglas’s view that behaving ethically is both the right thing to do 

and, in practical terms, helps maintain the trust the public places in those who act on its 

behalf.  The Federal Reserve’s very effectiveness in setting monetary policy depends on 

the public’s assured confidence that we act only in its interest.  We must act ethically, and 

we must demonstrate our ethical standards in ways that leave little room for doubt.   

I am grateful to share this award with Ben, and I am even more grateful for the 

example Paul Douglas set for ethics in government that has guided countless public 

officials since his day and also shaped the public’s expectation that its leaders will put the 

public’s interests first.
