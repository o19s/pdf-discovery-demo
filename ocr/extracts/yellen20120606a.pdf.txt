Boston Economic Club Dinner

Good evening.  I’m honored to have the opportunity to address the Boston Economic 

Club and I’m grateful to Chip Case for inviting me to speak to you tonight.  As most of you 

probably know, Chip was one of the first economists to document worrisome signs of a housing 

bubble in parts of the United States.  After sounding an early alarm in 2003, Chip watched the 

bubble grow and was prescient in anticipating the very serious toll that its unwinding would 

impose on the economy.  Chip recognized that declining house prices would affect not just 

residential construction but also consumer spending, the ability of households to borrow, and the 

health of the financial system.  In light of these pervasive linkages, the repeat sales house price 

index that bears Chip’s name is one of the most closely watched of all U.S. economic indicators.  

Indeed, as I will discuss this evening, prolonged weakness in the housing sector remains one of 

several serious headwinds facing the U.S. economy.  Given these headwinds, I believe that a 

highly accommodative monetary policy will be needed for quite some time to help the economy 

mend.  Before continuing, let me emphasize that my remarks reflect my own views and not 

necessarily those of others in the Federal Reserve System.1 

Economic Conditions and the Outlook 

In my remarks tonight, I will describe my perspective on monetary policy.  To begin, 

however, I’ll highlight some of the current conditions and key features of the economic outlook 

that shape my views.  To anticipate the main points, the economy appears to be expanding at a 

moderate pace.  The unemployment rate is almost 1 percentage point lower than it was a year 

ago, but we are still far from full employment.  Looking ahead, I anticipate that significant 

headwinds will continue to restrain the pace of the recovery so that the remaining employment

gap is likely to close only slowly.  At the same time, inflation (abstracting from the transitory 

effects of movements in oil prices) has been running near 2 percent over the past two years, and I 

expect it to remain at or below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (the FOMC’s) 2 percent 

objective for the foreseeable future.  As always, considerable uncertainty attends the outlook for 

both growth and inflation; events could prove either more positive or negative than what I see as 

the most likely outcome.  That said, as I will explain, I consider the balance of risks to be tilted 

toward a weaker economy.    

Starting with the labor market, conditions have gradually improved over the past year, 

albeit at an uneven pace.  Average monthly payroll gains picked up from about 145,000 in the 

second half of 2011 to 225,000 during the first quarter of this year.  However, these gains fell 

back to around 75,000 a month in April and May.  The deceleration of payroll employment from 

the first to the second quarter was probably exacerbated by some combination of seasonal 

adjustment difficulties and an unusually mild winter that likely boosted employment growth 

earlier in the year.  Payback for that earlier strength probably accounts for some of the weakness 

we’ve seen recently.  Smoothing through these fluctuations, the average pace of job creation for 

the year to date, as well as recent unemployment benefit claims data and other indicators, appear 

to be consistent with an economy expanding at only a moderate rate, close to its potential. 

Such modest growth would imply little additional progress in the near term in improving 

labor market conditions, which remain very weak.  Currently, the unemployment rate stands 

around 3 percentage points above where it was at the onset of the recession--a figure that is stark 

enough as it is, but does not even take account of the millions more who have left the labor force 

or who would have joined under more normal circumstances in the past four years.  All told, 

only about half of the collapse in private payroll employment in 2008 and 2009 has been

reversed.  A critical question for monetary policy is the extent to which these numbers reflect a 

shortfall from full employment versus a rise in structural unemployment.  While the magnitude 

of structural unemployment is uncertain, I read the evidence as suggesting that the bulk of the 

rise during the recession was cyclical, not structural in nature. 

Consider figure 1, which presents three indicators of labor market slack.  The black solid 

line is the unemployment gap, defined as the difference between the actual unemployment rate 

and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimate of the rate consistent with inflation 

remaining stable over time.  The red dashed line is an index of the difficulty households perceive 

in finding jobs, based on results from a survey conducted by the Conference Board.  And the red 

dotted line is an index of firms’ ability to fill jobs, based on a survey conducted by the National 

Federation of Independent Business.  All three measures show similar cyclical movements over 

the past 20 years, and all now stand at very high levels.  This similarity runs counter to claims 

that the CBO’s and other estimates of the unemployment gap overstate the true amount of slack 

by placing insufficient weight on structural explanations, such as a reduced efficiency of 

matching workers to jobs, for the rise in unemployment since 2007.  If that were the case, why 

would firms now find it so easy to fill positions?  Other evidence also points to the dominant role 

of cyclical forces in the recent rise in unemployment:  job losses have been widespread, rather 

than being concentrated in the construction and financial sectors, and the co-movement of job 

vacancies and unemployment over the past few years does not appear to be unusual.2   

As I mentioned, I expect several factors to restrain the pace of the recovery and the 

corresponding improvement in the labor market going forward.  The housing sector remains a

source of very significant headwinds.  Housing has typically been a driver of economic 

recoveries, and we have seen some modest improvement recently, but continued uncertainties 

over the direction of house prices, and very restricted mortgage credit availability for all but the 

most creditworthy buyers, will likely weigh on housing demand for some time to come.  When 

housing demand does pick up more noticeably, the huge overhang of both unoccupied dwellings 

and homes in the foreclosure pipeline will likely allow a good deal of that demand to be met for 

a time without a sizeable expansion in homebuilding.  Moreover, the enormous toll on household 

wealth resulting from the collapse of house prices--almost a 35 percent decline from its 2006 

peak, according to the Case-Shiller index--imposes ongoing restraint on consumer spending, and 

the loss of home equity has impaired many households’ ability to borrow.    

A second headwind that will likely become more important over coming months relates 

to fiscal policy.  At the federal level, stimulus-related policies are scheduled to wind down, while 

both defense and nondefense purchases are expected to decline in inflation-adjusted terms over 

the next several years.  Toward the end of this year, important decisions regarding the extension 

of current federal tax and budget policies loom.  I will return to the associated uncertainties and 

their potentially detrimental effects later. 

A third factor weighing on the outlook is the likely sluggish pace of economic growth 

abroad.  Strains in global financial markets have resurfaced in recent months, reflecting renewed 

uncertainty about the resolution of the European situation.  Risk premiums on sovereign debt and 

other securities have risen again in many European countries, while European banks continue to 

face pressure to shrink their balance sheets.  Even without a further intensification of stresses, the 

slowdown in economic activity in Europe will likely hold back U.S. export growth.  Moreover, 


- 5 - 
 

the perceived risks surrounding the European situation are already having a meaningful effect on 

financial conditions here in the United States, further weighing on the prospects for U.S. growth. 

Given these formidable challenges, most private sector forecasters expect only gradual 

improvement in the labor market and I share their view.  Figure 2 shows the unemployment rate 

together with the median forecast from last month’s Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF), 

the dashed blue line.3  The figure also shows the central tendency of the unemployment 

projections that my FOMC colleagues and I made at our April meeting: Those projections reflect 

our assessments of the economic outlook given our own individual judgments about the 

appropriate path of monetary policy.  Included in the figure as well is the central tendency of 

FOMC participants’ estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate, which ranges from 

5.2 percent to 6 percent.  Like private forecasters, most FOMC participants expect the 

unemployment rate to remain well above its longer-run normal value over the next several years.   

Of course, considerable uncertainty attends this outlook:  The shaded area provides an 

estimate of the 70 percent confidence interval for the future path of the unemployment rate based 

on historical experience and model simulations.4  Its width suggests that these projections could 

be quite far off, in either direction.  Nevertheless, the figure shows that labor market slack at 

present is so large that even a very large and favorable forecast error would not change the 

conclusion that slack will likely remain substantial for quite some time. 

                                                            
3 The SPF released in May provides forecasts on a quarterly basis through mid-2013 and annual projections beyond 
that date.  To construct quarterly forecasts through the end of 2014, I interpolate the annual projections. 
4 The forecast confidence interval is generated using stochastic simulations of the Federal Reserve staff’s FRB/US 
model.  Specifically, a baseline is constructed centered on the median of the SPF projections released in May, and 
then the model is repeatedly simulated with shocks drawn from the set of historical disturbances experienced over 
the period from 1968 to 2011.  Similar estimates of forecast confidence intervals would be obtained if the intervals 
were instead constructed using the actual historical forecast errors of private forecasters; for further discussion, see 
table 2 of the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the April Federal Open Market 
Committee minutes, available at Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), “Minutes of the Federal 
Open Market Committee, April 24-25, 2012,” press release, May 16, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120516a.htm.

Turning to inflation, figure 3 summarizes private and FOMC forecasts.  Overall 

consumer price inflation has fluctuated quite a bit in recent years, largely reflecting movements 

in prices for oil and other commodities.  In early 2011 and again earlier this year, prices of crude 

oil, and thus of gasoline, rose noticeably.  Smoothing through these fluctuations, inflation as 

measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) averaged near 2 

percent over the past two years.  In recent weeks, however, oil and gasoline prices have 

moderated and are now showing through to the headline inflation figures.  Looking ahead, most 

FOMC participants at the time of our April meeting expected inflation to be at, or a bit below, 

our long-run objective of 2 percent through 2014; private forecasters on average also expect 

inflation to be close to 2 percent.  As with unemployment, uncertainty around the inflation 

projection is substantial. 

In the view of some observers, the stability of inflation in the face of high unemployment 

in recent years constitutes evidence that much of the remaining unemployment is structural and 

not cyclical.  They reason that if there were truly substantial slack in the labor market, simple 

accelerationist “Phillips curve” models would predict more noticeable downward pressure on 

inflation.  However, substantial cross-country evidence suggests that, in low-inflation 

environments, inflation is notably less responsive to downward pressure from labor market slack 

than it is when inflation is elevated.  In other words, the short-run Phillips curve may flatten out.5  

One important reason for this non-linearity, in my view, is downward nominal wage rigidity--

that is, the reluctance or inability of many firms to cut nominal wages.   

                                                            
5 The simplest accelerationist version of the Phillips curve relates the change in inflation to the level of labor market 
slack; more-complicated versions also highlight the influence of inflation expectations, changes in marginal 
production costs, and other factors.  Evidence for the United States and other countries that the sensitivity of 
inflation to resource slack may be nonlinear can be found in André Meier (2010), “Still Minding the Gap--Inflation 
Dynamics during Episodes of Persistent Large Output Gaps,” IMF Working Paper WP/10/189 (Washington:  
International Monetary Fund, August), www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp10189.pdf.

The solid blue bars in figure 4 present a snapshot of the distribution of nominal wage 

changes for individual jobs during the depth of the current labor market slump, based on data 

collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.6  For comparison, the dashed red line presents a 

hypothetical distribution of wage changes, using a normal distribution that approximates the 

actual distribution of wage changes greater than zero.  The distribution of actual wage changes 

shows that a relatively high percentage of workers saw no change in their nominal wage, and 

relatively few experienced modest wage cuts.  This pile-up phenomenon at zero suggests that, 

even when the unemployment rate was around 10 percent, many firms were reluctant to cut 

nominal wage rates.  In the absence of this barrier, nominal gains in wages and unit labor costs 

would have likely been even more subdued given the severity of the economic downturn, with 

the result that inflation would probably now be running at a lower rate.   

Anchored inflation expectations are another reason why inflation has remained close to 2 

percent in the face of very low resource utilization.  As shown in figure 5, survey measures of 

longer-horizon inflation expectations have remained nearly constant since the mid-1990s even as 

actual inflation has fluctuated.  As a result, the current slump has not generated the downward 

spiral of falling expected and actual inflation that a simple accelerationist model of inflation 

might have predicted.  Indeed, keeping inflation expectations from declining has been an 

important success of monetary policy over the past few years.  At the same time, the fact that 

longer-term inflation expectations have not risen above 2 percent has also proved extremely 

                                                            
6 The data shown in figure 4 refer to the change in wages over the 12 months to March 2010.  See Bruce Fallick, 
Michael Lettau, and William Wascher (2011), “Downward Nominal Wage Rigidity in the United States during the 
Great Recession,” unpublished manuscript, November.  Similar results, based on a different source of data, are 
reported in Mary Daly, Bart Hobijn, and Brian Lucking (2012), “Why Has Wage Growth Stayed Strong?” Federal 
Reserve Bank of San Francisco, FRBSF Economic Letter 2012-10, April 2, 
www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-10.html.  I have explored the implications of downward 
nominal rigidity for the Phillips curve and stabilization policy in greater depth in Janet L. Yellen and George A. 
Akerlof (2006), “Stabilization Policy:  A Reconsideration,” Economic Inquiry, vol. 44 (January), pp. 1-22.

valuable, for it has freed the FOMC to take strong actions to support the economic recovery 

without greatly worrying that higher energy and commodity prices would become ingrained in 

inflation and inflation expectations, as they did in the 1970s. 

While my modal outlook calls for only a gradual reduction in labor market slack and a 

stable pace of inflation near the FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent, I see substantial risks 

to this outlook, particularly to the downside.  As I mentioned before, even without any political 

gridlock, fiscal policy is bound to become substantially less accommodative from early 2013 on.  

However, federal fiscal policy could turn even more restrictive if the Congress does not reach 

agreement on several important tax and budget policy issues before the end of this year; in fact, 

the CBO recently warned that the potential hit to gross domestic product (GDP) growth could be 

sufficient to push the economy into recession in 2013.7  The deterioration of financial conditions 

in Europe of late, coupled with notable declines in global equity markets, also serve as a 

reminder that highly destabilizing outcomes cannot be ruled out.  Finally, besides these clearly 

identifiable sources of risk, there remains the broader issue that economic forecasters have 

repeatedly overestimated the strength of the recovery and so still may be too optimistic about the 

prospects that growth will strengthen.  

Although I view the bulk of the increase in unemployment since 2007 as cyclical, I am 

concerned that it could become a permanent problem if the recovery were to stall.  In this 

economic downturn, the fraction of the workforce unemployed for six months or more has 

climbed much more than in previous recessions, and remains at a remarkably high level.  

Continued high unemployment could wreak long-term damage by eroding the skills and labor

force attachment of workers suffering long-term unemployment, thereby turning what was 

initially cyclical into structural unemployment.  This risk provides another important reason to 

support the recovery by maintaining a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy. 

The Conduct of Policy with Unconventional Tools  

Now turning to monetary policy, I will begin by discussing the FOMC’s reliance on 

unconventional tools to address the disappointing pace of recovery.  I will then elaborate my 

rationale for supporting a highly accommodative policy stance.    

As you know, since late 2008, the FOMC’s standard policy tool, the target federal funds 

rate, has been maintained at the zero lower bound.  To provide further accommodation, we have 

employed two unconventional tools to support the recovery--extended forward guidance about 

the future path of the federal funds rate, and large-scale asset purchases and other balance sheet 

actions that have greatly increased the size and duration of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio.   

These two tools have become increasingly important because the recovery from the 

recession has turned out to be persistently slower than either the FOMC or private forecasters 

anticipated.  Figure 6 illustrates the magnitude of the disappointment by comparing Blue Chip 

forecasts for real GDP growth made two years ago with ones made earlier this year.  As shown 

by the dashed blue line, private forecasters in early 2010 anticipated that real GDP would expand 

at an average annual rate of just over 3 percent from 2010 through 2014.  However, actual 

growth in 2011 and early 2012 has turned out to be much weaker than expected, and, as 

indicated by the dotted red line, private forecasters now anticipate only a modest acceleration in 

real activity over the next few years.   

In response to the evolving outlook, the FOMC has progressively added policy 

accommodation using both of its unconventional tools.  For example, since the federal funds rate 


- 10 - 
 

target was brought down to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent in December 2008, the FOMC has 

gradually adjusted its forward guidance about the anticipated future path of the federal funds 

rate.  In each meeting statement from March 2009 through June 2011, the Committee indicated 

its expectation that economic conditions “are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the 

federal funds rate for an extended period.”8  At the August 2011 meeting, the Committee decided 

to provide more specific information about the likely time horizon by substituting the phrase “at 

least through mid-2013” for the phrase “for an extended period”; at the January 2012 meeting, 

this horizon was extended to “at least through late 2014.”9  Has this guidance worked?  Figure 7 

illustrates how dramatically forecasters’ expectations of future short-term interest rates have 

changed.  As the dashed blue line indicates, the Blue Chip consensus forecast made in early 2010 

anticipated that the Treasury-bill rate would now stand at close to 3-1/2 percent; today, in 

contrast, private forecasters expect short-term interest rates to remain very low in 2014.   

Of course, much of this revision in interest rate projections would likely have occurred in 

the absence of explicit forward guidance; given the deterioration in projections of real activity 

due to the unanticipated persistence of headwinds, and the continued subdued outlook for 

inflation, forecasters would naturally have anticipated a greater need for the FOMC to provide 

continued monetary accommodation.  However, I believe the changes over time in the language 

of the FOMC statement, coupled with information provided by Chairman Bernanke and others in 

speeches and congressional testimony, helped the public understand better the Committee’s 

likely policy response given the slower-than-expected economic recovery.  As a result,

March 18, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20090318a.htm.

forecasters and market participants appear to have marked down their expectations for future 

short-term interest rates by more than they otherwise would have, thereby putting additional 

downward pressure on long-term interest rates, improving broader financial conditions, and 

lending support to aggregate demand.       

The FOMC has also provided further monetary accommodation over time by altering the 

size and composition of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings, shown in figure 8.  The 

expansion in the volume of securities held by the Federal Reserve is shown in the left panel of 

the figure.  During 2009 and early 2010, the Federal Reserve purchased about $1.4 trillion in 

agency mortgage-backed securities and agency debt securities and about $300 billion in longer-

term Treasury securities.  In November 2010, the Committee initiated an additional $600 billion 

in purchases of longer-term Treasury securities, which were completed at the end of June of last 

year.  Last September, the FOMC decided to implement the “Maturity Extension Program,” 

which affected the maturity composition of our Treasury holdings as shown in the right panel.  

Through this program, the FOMC is extending the average maturity of its securities holdings by 

selling $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less and 

purchasing an equivalent amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 to 30 

years.  These transactions are currently scheduled to be completed at the end of this month.  

Research by Federal Reserve staff and others suggests that our balance sheet operations 

have had substantial effects on longer-term Treasury yields, principally by reducing term 

premiums on longer-dated Treasury securities.10  Figure 9 provides an estimate, based on Federal 

                                                            
10 The term premium on a longer-dated Treasury security is defined as the return that investors expect to earn on 
holding this security in excess of the return from rolling over short-dated Treasury securities, such as three-month 
Treasury bills.  For estimates of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet actions on long-term interest rates, see Canlin 
Li and Min Wei (forthcoming), “Term Structure Modeling with Supply Factors and the Federal Reserve’s Large 
Scale Asset Purchase Programs,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series (Washington:  Board of Governors of 
the Federal Reserve System); Joseph Gagnon, Matthew Raskin, Julie Remache, and Brian Sack (2010), “Large-

Reserve Board staff calculations, of the cumulative reduction of the term premium on 10-year 

Treasury securities from the three balance sheet programs.  These results suggest that our 

portfolio actions are currently keeping 10-year Treasury yields roughly 60 basis points lower 

than they otherwise would be.11  Other evidence suggests that this downward pressure has had 

favorable spillover effects on other financial markets, leading to lower long-term borrowing 

costs for households and firms, higher equity valuations, and other improvements in financial 

conditions that in turn have supported consumption, investment, and net exports.  Because the 

term premium effect depends on both the Federal Reserve’s current and expected future asset 

holdings, most of this effect--without further actions--will likely wane over the next few years as

11 The estimates shown in figure 9 employ the methodology discussed by Li and Wei, “Term Structure Modeling 
with Supply Factors,” in note 10.  These calculations require an assumption for market participants’ expectations for 
the future path of the Federal Reserve’s portfolio at different points in time, both in the past and going forward; 
accordingly, the estimates are somewhat sensitive to alternative assumptions for market expectations.  In estimating 
the current and future effect of the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings on term premiums, market participants are 
assumed to have expectations consistent with the illustrative baseline discussed in note 16 and the exit principles 
outlined by the FOMC in June 2011 (see note 18).  In particular, investors are assumed to expect that the overall size 
and composition of the portfolio will remain roughly constant from the end of 2012:Q2 through late 2014 because 
principal payments on the Federal Reserve’s security holdings will be reinvested until a few months prior to the 
liftoff of the federal funds rate assumed in the illustrative baseline.  At that point, the portfolio is assumed to begin to 
contract through redemptions and, after the assumed liftoff of the federal funds rate, through sales of mortgage-
backed securities that bring the Federal Reserve’s holdings of such securities to zero over a three-to-five-year 
period.  As a result, the size of the portfolio returns to normal within a few years after liftoff.

the effect depends less and less on the current elevated level of the balance sheet and 

increasingly on the level of holdings during and after the normalization of our portfolio.12 

The Rationale for Highly Accommodative Policy 

I have already noted that, in my view, an extended period of highly accommodative 

policy is necessary to combat the persistent headwinds to recovery.  I will next explain how I’ve 

reached this policy judgment.  In evaluating the stance of policy, I find the prescriptions from 

simple policy rules a logical starting point.  A wide range of such rules has been examined in the 

academic literature, the most famous of which is that proposed by John Taylor in his 1993 

study.13  Rules of the general sort proposed by Taylor (1993) capture well our statutory mandate 

to promote maximum employment and price stability by prescribing that the federal funds rate 

should respond to the deviation of inflation from its longer-run goal and to the output gap, given 

that the economy should be at or close to full employment when the output gap--the difference 

between actual GDP and an estimate of potential output--is closed.  Moreover, research suggests 

that such simple rules can be reasonably robust to uncertainty about the true structure of the 

economy, as they perform well in a variety of models.14  Today, I will consider the prescriptions 

of two such benchmark rules--Taylor’s 1993 rule, and a variant that is twice as responsive to 

economic slack.  In my view, this latter rule is more consistent with the FOMC’s commitment to 

                                                            
12 The term premium effect also wanes over time because the size of the effect depends on the expected difference 
between the actual size of the balance sheet now and in the future and its normal size, where the latter is rising 
steadily over time, primarily as a result of the trend growth in currency.

Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of Monetary Economics, vol. 3B (San 
Diego:  North Holland), pp. 829-60.

follow a balanced approach to promoting our dual mandate, and so I will refer to it as the 

“balanced-approach” rule.15 

To show the prescriptions these rules would have called for at the April FOMC meeting, I 

start with an illustrative baseline outlook constructed using the projections for unemployment, 

inflation, and the federal funds rate that FOMC participants reported in April.16  I then employ 

the dynamics of one of the Federal Reserve’s economic models, the FRB/US model, to solve for 

the joint paths of these three variables if the short-term interest rate had instead been set 

according to the Taylor (1993) rule or the balanced-approach rule, subject, in both cases, to the 

zero lower bound constraint on the federal funds rate.  The dashed red line in figure 10 shows the 

resulting path for the federal funds rate under Taylor (1993) and the solid blue line with open 

circles illustrates the corresponding path using the balanced-approach rule.17  In both 

simulations, the private sector fully understands that monetary policy follows the particular rule 

in force.18  Figure 10 shows that the Taylor rule calls for monetary policy to tighten immediately, 

while the balanced-approach rule prescribes raising the federal funds rate in the fourth quarter of 

                                                            
15 The balanced-approach rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt - 2) + 1.0Yt.  In this expression, R is the federal funds 
rate, π is the percent change in the headline personal consumption expenditures price index from four quarters 
earlier, and Y is the output gap.  In a recent speech, I dubbed this rule “Taylor (1999),” as John Taylor described the 
rule in a paper published that year.  Since Taylor’s own strong preference is for his original rule--Taylor (1993)--I 
now refer to the later rule as the “balanced-approach rule.” 
16 The baseline paths for unemployment and inflation track the midpoint of the central tendency of the Committee’s 
projections through 2014 and thereafter gradually converge to values consistent with participants’ long-run 
projections.  Similarly, the baseline path for the federal funds rate stays near zero through late 2014 and then rises 
steadily back to the long-run value expected by most participants.  While these assumptions are consistent with 
recent FOMC statements, both the assumed date of liftoff and the longer-run pace of tightening are merely 
illustrative and are not based on any internal FOMC deliberations.  For further details on the construction of the 
baseline, see Yellen, “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” in note 2.   
17 Because both rules respond to the output gap, the projections for the unemployment rate need to be converted into 
a path for the output gap.  The output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.3(5.6-Ut), where 
2.3 is the estimated value of the Okun’s law coefficient and 5.6 is the assumed value of the non-accelerating 
inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU. 
18 In the simulations, the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is assumed to evolve in accordance with the exit strategy 
principles that the FOMC agreed upon at the June 2011 meeting.  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve 
System (2011), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, June 21-22, 2011,” press release, July 12, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20110712a.htm.

2014--the earliest date consistent with the FOMC’s current forward guidance of “exceptionally 

low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.”   

Although simple rules provide a useful starting point in determining appropriate policy, 

they by no means deserve the “last word”--especially in current circumstances.  An alternative 

approach, also illustrated in figure 10, is to compute an “optimal control” path for the federal 

funds rate using an economic model--FRB/US, in this case.  Such a path is chosen to minimize 

the value of a specific “loss function” conditional on a baseline forecast of economic conditions.  

The loss function attempts to quantify the social costs resulting from deviations of inflation from 

the Committee’s longer-run goal and from deviations of unemployment from its longer-run 

normal rate.19  The solid green line with dots in figure 10 shows the “optimal control” path for 

the federal funds rate, again conditioned on the illustrative baseline outlook.20  This policy 

involves keeping the federal funds rate close to zero until late 2015, four quarters longer than the 

balanced-approach rule prescription and several years longer than the Taylor rule.  Importantly, 

optimal control calls for a later lift-off date even though this benchmark--unlike the simple 

policy rules--implicitly takes full account of the additional stimulus to real activity and inflation 

                                                            
19 Under this approach, the central bank’s plans are assumed to be completely transparent and credible to the public.  
In particular, both the policymaker and private agents are assumed to act as if they have perfect foresight about the 
evolution of the economy, including the future path of monetary policy, in that they ignore the possibility of 
unanticipated future shocks to the economy.  This assumption of “certainty equivalence” is commonly used but is 
not an intrinsic feature of optimal control techniques.  Indeed, the fully optimal policy under uncertainty involves the 
specification of a complete set of state-contingent policy paths. 
20 This procedure involves two steps.  First, the FRB/US model’s projections of real activity, inflation, and interest 
rates are adjusted to replicate the baseline forecast values.  Second, a search procedure is used to solve for the path 
of the federal funds rate that minimizes the value of an assumed loss function, allowing for feedback of changes in 
the federal funds rate from baseline to real activity and inflation.  For the purposes of the exercise, the loss function 
is equal to the cumulative discounted sum from 2012:Q2 through 2025:Q4 of three factors--the squared deviation of 
the unemployment rate from 5-1/2 percent, the squared deviation of overall PCE inflation from 2 percent, and the 
squared quarterly change in the federal funds rate.  The third term is added to damp quarter-to-quarter movements in 
interest rates.

being provided over time by the Federal Reserve’s other policy tool, the past and projected 

changes to the size and maturity of its securities holdings.21    

Figure 11 shows that, by keeping the federal funds rate at its current level for longer, 

monetary policy under the balanced-approach rule achieves a more rapid reduction of the 

unemployment rate than monetary policy under the Taylor (1993) rule does, while nonetheless 

keeping inflation near 2 percent.  But the improvement in labor market conditions is even more 

notable under the optimal control path, even as inflation remains close to the FOMC’s long-run 

inflation objective.  

As I noted, simple rules have the advantage of delivering good policy outcomes across a 

broad range of models, and are thereby relatively robust to our limited understanding of the 

precise working of the economy--in contrast to optimal-control policies, whose prescriptions are 

sensitive to the specification of the particular model used in the analysis.  However, simple rules 

also have their shortcomings, leading them to significantly understate the case for keeping policy 

persistently accommodative in current circumstances.   

One of these shortcomings is that the rules do not adjust for the constraints that the zero 

lower bound has placed on conventional monetary policy since late 2008.  A second is that they 

do not fully take account of the protracted nature of the forces that have been restraining 

aggregate demand in the aftermath of the housing bust.  As I’ve emphasized, the pace of the 

current recovery has turned out to be persistently slower than most observers expected, and 

forecasters expect it to remain quite moderate by historical standards.  The headwinds that 

explain this disappointing performance represent a substantial departure from normal cyclical 

                                                            
21 Optimal control takes account of the stimulus provided by the balance sheet operations because it conditions on a 
baseline forecast of real activity and inflation that (at least implicitly) incorporates the effects of the Federal 
Reserve’s balance sheet operations on projected financial conditions, real activity, and inflation.

dynamics.  As a result, the economy’s equilibrium real federal funds rate--that is, the rate that 

would be consistent with full employment over the medium run--is probably well below its 

historical average, which the intercept of simple policy rules is supposed to approximate.  By 

failing to fully adjust for this decline, the prescriptions of simple policy rules--which provide a 

useful benchmark under normal circumstances--could be significantly too restrictive now and 

could remain so for some time to come.  In this regard, I think it is informative that the Blue 

Chip consensus forecast released in March showed the real three-month Treasury bill rate 

settling down at only 1-1/4 percent late in the decade, down 120 basis points from the long-run 

projections made prior to the recession. 22 

Looking Ahead 

Recent labor market reports and financial developments serve as a reminder that the 

economy remains vulnerable to setbacks.  Indeed, the simulations I described above did not take 

into account this new information.  In our policy deliberations at the upcoming FOMC meeting 

we will assess the effects of these developments on the economic forecast.  If the Committee 

were to judge that the recovery is unlikely to proceed at a satisfactory pace (for example, that the 

forecast entails little or no improvement in the labor market over the next few years), or that the 

downside risks to the outlook had become sufficiently great, or that inflation appeared to be in 

danger of declining notably below its 2 percent objective, I am convinced that scope remains for 

the FOMC to provide further policy accommodation either through its forward guidance or 

through additional balance-sheet actions.  In taking these decisions, however, we would need to 

balance two considerations. 

                                                            
22 For a further discussion of this issue, see William C. Dudley (2012), “Conducting Monetary Policy:  Rules, 
Learning and Risk Management,” speech delivered at the C. Peter McColough Series on International Economics,

www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2012/dud120524.html.

On the one hand, our unconventional tools have some limitations and costs.  For 

example, the effects of forward guidance are likely to be weaker the longer the horizon of the 

guidance, implying that it may be difficult to provide much more stimulus through this channel.  

As for our balance sheet operations, although we have now acquired some experience with this 

tool, there is still considerable uncertainty about its likely economic effects.  Moreover, some 

have expressed concern that a substantial further expansion of the balance sheet could interfere 

with the Fed’s ability to execute a smooth exit from its accommodative policies at the 

appropriate time.  I disagree with this view: The FOMC has tested a variety of tools to ensure 

that we will be able to raise short-term interest rates when needed while gradually returning the 

portfolio to a more normal size and composition.  But even if unjustified, such concerns could in 

theory reduce confidence in the Federal Reserve and so lead to an undesired increase in inflation 

expectations.   

On the other hand, risk management considerations arising from today’s unusual 

circumstances strengthen the case for additional accommodation beyond that called for by simple 

policy rules and optimal control under the modal outlook.  In particular, as I have noted, there are 

a number of significant downside risks to the economic outlook, and hence it may well be 

appropriate to insure against adverse shocks that could push the economy into territory where a 

self-reinforcing downward spiral of economic weakness would be difficult to arrest.   

Conclusion 

In my remarks this evening I have sought to explain why, in my view, a highly 

accommodative monetary policy will remain appropriate for some time to come.  My views 

concerning the stance of monetary policy reflect the FOMC’s firm commitment to the goals of 

maximum employment and stable prices, my appraisal of the medium term outlook (which is 


- 19 - 
 

importantly shaped by the persistent legacy of the housing bust and ensuing financial crisis), and 

by my assessment of the balance of risks facing the economy.  Of course, as I’ve emphasized, the 

outlook is uncertain and the Committee will need to adjust policy as appropriate as actual 

conditions unfold.  For this reason, the FOMC’s forward guidance is explicitly conditioned on its 

anticipation of “low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the 

medium run.”23  If the recovery were to proceed faster than expected or if inflation pressures 

were to pick up materially, the FOMC could adjust policy by bringing forward the expected date 

of tightening.  In contrast, if the Committee judges that the recovery is proceeding at an 

insufficient pace, we could undertake portfolio actions such as additional asset purchases or a 

further maturity extension program.  It is for this reason that the FOMC emphasized, in its 

statement following the April meeting, that it would “regularly review the size and composition 

of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a 

stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.”24

Behavior of Inflation and Unemployment  
 

• Does the stability of inflation in the face of high 
unemployment mean that unemployment is 
structural, not cyclical?   

• Simple Phillips curve model predicts downward 
pressure on inflation from labor market slack.  

• But cross country evidence shows that once 
inflation is low, it is less responsive to slack.   

• This nonlinearity may reflect downward 
nominal wage rigidity.
