By

Chairman 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

Ceremonial Swearing-In  

Atrium 

Federal Reserve Board 

Washington, D.C. 


February 3, 2010


 It is with considerable gratitude and not a little humility that I begin a second term as 

Chairman of the Board of Governors.  I thank President Obama for the confidence he has shown 

in me by renominating me and the members of the Senate for confirming my nomination. 

The past four years have been an extraordinary time.  In many respects, this period has 

shown this institution at its finest, as we moved rapidly, forcefully, and creatively to confront the 

deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression and help prevent a looming economic 

collapse.  This swift and effective response would not have been possible without the remarkable 

dedication, professionalism, and personal sacrifices of the Federal Reserve staff.  I would like to 

express my deep appreciation to all of you for your creativity and hard work.  America and the 

world owe you a debt of gratitude. 

 At the same time, this institution, like our country, faces enormous challenges, challenges 

that will demand continued commitment and professionalism from staff members in every 

division.  

On the economic front, the resumption of growth in the nation’s output of goods and 

services is encouraging.  But far too many people remain unemployed, foreclosures continue at 

record rates, and bank credit continues to contract.  We at the Federal Reserve cannot hope to 

solve all these problems on our own--other policymakers and those in the private sector must do 

their part--but we must continue to do all that we can to ensure that our policies are helping to 

guide the country’s return to prosperity in an environment of price stability. 

At the Federal Reserve and other agencies, the crisis revealed weaknesses and gaps in the 

regulation and supervision of financial institutions and financial markets.  Working together, the 

Fed staff and the Board have made considerable progress in identifying problems and improving 

how we carry out our oversight responsibilities.  We are restructuring our supervisory

framework, for example, to incorporate a more systemic, multidisciplinary perspective.  We are 

engaging with international colleagues to develop tough, comprehensive regulations to promote 

the safety and soundness of financial institutions, and we have developed and implemented 

strong new protections for consumers.  We will continue to work with the Congress to develop 

an effective, comprehensive reform of financial regulation.  As we move forward, we must 

continue to do all that can be done to ensure that our economy is never again devastated by a 

financial collapse. 

 The Federal Reserve has been granted, both in law and in political tradition, considerable 

independence and autonomy.  That independence serves important public objectives.  Critically, 

it allows the Federal Open Market Committee to make monetary policy in the longer-term 

economic interests of the American people, rather than in the service of short-term political 

imperatives.  It also allows the Federal Reserve to make supervisory decisions based on the facts 

of each case and the need to preserve financial stability, not on the basis of political 

considerations.  In the interest of maintaining public confidence and promoting economic and 

financial stability, we must continue to protect our independence. 

 At the same time, in a democratic society like our own, institutional independence brings 

with it fundamental obligations of transparency, responsiveness, and accountability.  The Federal 

Reserve is already one of the most transparent and accountable central banks in the world, 

providing voluminous information and explanation concerning all of its activities.  However, I 

believe that we should be prepared to do even more, to become even more transparent.  It is 

essential that the public have the information it needs to understand and be assured of the 

integrity of all our operations, including all aspects of our balance sheet and our financial 

controls.  We will continue to work with the Congress to ensure maximum transparency of 


- 3 - 
 

America’s central bank, without compromising our ability to conduct policy in the public 

interest.   

 These are just some of the challenges that we will all face in the coming months and 

years.  I thank you for the many expressions of support I received during the confirmation 

process, for your hard work and dedication, and for your service to your country.  I look forward 

to continuing to work with all of you to strengthen our economy and to make the Federal 

Reserve as effective as it can possibly be in advancing the economic wellbeing of all Americans.  

Thank you.
