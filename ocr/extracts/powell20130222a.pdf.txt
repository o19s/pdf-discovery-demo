The issue of fiscal sustainability and its interaction with monetary policy is 

certainly timely.1  Many advanced economies are in an extended period of slow growth 

and high deficits, and face long-term fiscal pressures from aging populations.   

I agree with much in this broad-ranging paper.2  In particular, the authors join 

others in finding that accommodative monetary policy is often associated with successful 

fiscal consolidations.  They conclude that a “tough love” alternative, which would call for 

the Federal Reserve to withhold monetary accommodation until fiscal policymakers enact 

legislation to reduce budget imbalances, is likely to be counterproductive.  Indeed, I 

would argue that the tough love approach also would require the Fed to deviate from the 

dual mandate that the Congress has assigned it, while assuming a role in influencing 

fiscal policy that the Congress has not assigned it.   

I find myself in disagreement, however, with the paper’s assessment that the 

current fiscal policy challenges might interfere in the near-term with the conduct of 

monetary policy in the United States.   

Three important propositions underlie the authors’ argument on this issue:    

1. The federal government’s fiscal path is unsustainable under current 

policies. 

2. If the market concludes that a government either cannot or will not service 

its debt, the central bank may be forced to choose ultimately between

monetization leading to inflation or standing by as the government 

defaults--the threat of “fiscal dominance.”   

3. The Federal Reserve’s balance sheet is currently very large by historical 

standards and still growing. The process of normalizing the size and 

composition of the balance sheet poses significant uncertainties and 

challenges for monetary policymakers.  

I believe all of these statements to be true.  They are also widely, if not 

universally, accepted.  However, based on these points and, importantly, on their 

empirical findings, the authors set out to show that fiscal difficulties present a near-term 

threat to the conduct of monetary policy.  The paper argues that rising fiscal pressures, 

exacerbated by Federal Reserve losses on asset sales and low remittances to the Treasury, 

could lead the Federal Reserve to delay balance sheet normalization and to fail to remove 

monetary accommodation as needed to keep inflation expectations stable and inflation in 

check.  In that case, the market could perceive the onset of fiscal dominance, thus setting 

off a vicious cycle of rising inflation expectations, increasing interest rates, and ever 

greater fiscal unsustainability.  

In my view, this proposition seems highly unlikely.  At a minimum, it is 

premature.   

U.S. Fiscal Position 

The paper led me to look back over the past century of U.S. sovereign debt 

history.  On two prior occasions, federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product

(GDP) increased significantly--during the Great Depression-World War II era and, to a 

smaller extent, the two decades ending in the mid-1990s.3 

After each of these high-debt periods, fiscal policy responded by running 

sustained primary surpluses and reducing debt to levels below 40 percent of GDP.  In a 

recent paper, Henning Bohn observed that “the foundation of U.S. debt policy is the 

promise of safety for bondholders backed by primary surpluses only in response to a high 

debt-GDP ratio.”4  That nicely captures our recent history and suggests a principal reason 

why the federal debt of the United States still has the market’s trust.   

The Great Recession has generated a third substantial increase in federal debt, 

from about 35 percent of GDP in 2007 to around 75 percent at the end of this fiscal year, 

an increase that is consistent with other increases in sovereign debt for advanced 

economies after severe financial crises during the post-World War II period.5  History 

and common sense suggest that the federal government should again run primary 

surpluses sufficient over time to reduce debt to pre-crisis levels of perhaps 35 to 

40 percent of GDP.  That would leave fiscal space to address the coming wave of health 

and pension costs, as well as unexpected new shocks. 

In the past two years, spending cuts and tax increases totaling about $3.5 trillion 

over the next 10 years have been enacted.  Assuming these measures are not rolled back--

in particular, that the spending sequestration either takes effect or is replaced by 

equivalent deficit-reducing measures--a reasonable “current policy” projection  is that the

ratio of debt to GDP will be roughly stable at around 75 percent through about 2020.6  

After that, under current policy, health-care costs and, to a much lesser extent, pension 

costs will produce a sharp, sustained increase in the ratio of debt to GDP.   

Fiscal Sustainability and Monetary Policy 

The authors review empirical evidence of sovereign borrowing costs for 

20 advanced economies.  They join others in finding a statistically significant relationship 

between sovereign debt levels and borrowing costs.7  They also find nonlinear increases 

in borrowing costs beginning at debt-to-GDP ratios of around 80 percent.  But the 

nonlinearities they find are driven to a great extent by the experience of smaller euro-

zone nations that, of course, borrow in euros.  The United States borrows in its own 

currency--the world’s primary reserve currency.  That difference is crucial for investors, 

along with the fact that the United States economy remains the world’s largest and most 

productive.  The United Kingdom and Japan are also high-debt countries that borrow in 

their own currencies; neither shows any detectable rate increase, let alone a nonlinear 

one.  These countries present a serious problem for the authors’ case. 

Of course, the United States is not exempt from concerns about the potential long-

term effects of an unsustainable fiscal path.  There is almost certainly a level of debt at 

which the United States would be at risk of an interest rate spike.  However, we should

expect that level to be substantially above one identified based on the experience of 

smaller euro-zone nations.      

The argument also has a serious timing problem.  The Federal Reserve’s balance 

sheet likely will be normalized by late this decade, before the federal debt-to-GDP ratio 

even increases materially from today’s level.  Under the reasonable projection mentioned 

above, the debt-to-GDP ratio will remain roughly stable until 2020 before rising 

significantly in the next decade.8  That’s not a favorable longer-term forecast, all the 

more so because it is importantly the result of demographic changes that have been 

expected for decades.  But the forecast doesn’t support the authors’ claim that fears of 

fiscal dominance could materialize in the United States within the next five to seven 

years, during the period when the Fed is normalizing its balance sheet.   

No current market signal suggests that the United States is near the point of losing 

the market’s confidence.  In my view, nothing in the Congressional Budget Office debt 

forecasts or the authors’ empirical findings provides grounds for such an event during 

this decade.  The market has every reason to believe--and apparently still does believe--

that the United States will continue the difficult task of fiscal consolidation until the job 

is done. 

 Terribly difficult fiscal adjustments lie ahead.  Although there is still time to make 

them, delay will sharply increase the pain of adjustment.  The time to act is now.  In my 

view, the problem is not principally one of economics or fiscal policy; it is one of 

governance.  The real threat to the fiscal standing of the United States is that of inaction 

caused by a long period of political polarization and dysfunction.  That would be a self-

inflicted wound.  And that is a problem that can’t be derived from the traditional fiscal 

metrics. 

We may have more room than other economies around the globe, but I do not 

intend to project any sense of complacency around this topic.  The authors’ basic 

message seems just right to me:  We don’t know where the tipping point is; wherever it 

is, we are clearly getting closer to it, and the costs of misestimating its location are 

enormous and one-sided.  The benefits to long-term fiscal consolidation--conducted at the 

right pace, and without jeopardizing the near-term economic recovery--would be 

substantial.  

Balance Sheet Losses and Remittances 

The authors’ work on Federal Reserve income and remittances to the Treasury 

overlaps with a paper published last month by Federal Reserve Board staff members Seth 

Carpenter, Jane Ihrig, Beth Klee, Daniel Quinn, and Alexander Boote.9  Both papers 

provide a basis for public discussion of these matters, which is a highly positive 

development.  Some of the assets acquired through the Federal Reserve’s large-scale 

asset purchases (LSAPs) may be sold at a loss, and it is important to be transparent about 

this possibility.   

Thus far, the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases have greatly increased our income 

and remittances to the Treasury.  Indeed, remittances have run at an annual level of about 

$80 billion from 2010 to 2012.  Both papers show that remittances are likely to decline 

substantially from these elevated levels as interest rates rise and the Fed balance sheet

normalizes, and there may be a period of zero remittances.  If so, the balance sheet would 

show a deferred asset representing a flow of future income to be retained and not remitted 

to the Treasury.  Nonetheless, we expect that the LSAPs, which began in late 2008, will 

result in a net increase in remittances over the life of these programs.  Moreover, any 

temporary losses should be weighed against the expected social benefits of the increased 

economic growth generated by the LSAPs, which would include higher tax revenue from 

increased output. 

Greenlaw and his coauthors also note that we have the flexibility to normalize the 

balance sheet more slowly.  For example, a “no asset sale” plan--under which assets 

would simply run off as they mature--would push out the date of normalization by only a 

year or so.  That approach would also address concerns over potential market disruption 

from the sale of off-the-run agency mortgage-backed securities.  And it would also 

smooth remittances.     

Remittances averaged about $25 billion per year, or 0.2 percent of GDP, over the 

decade before the crisis.  After the balance sheet is normalized, these remittances should 

return to a similar, modest share of GDP.  From the standpoint of the sustainability of 

federal fiscal policy, remittances are not a first-order concern.  That said, an extended 

period of zero remittances could certainly bring the Federal Reserve under criticism from 

the public and the Congress.  The question is whether the Federal Reserve would permit 

inflation and thereby abandon its post in the face of such criticism.  There is no reason to 

expect that to happen. 

The Federal Reserve was created as an independent agency, and a broad 

consensus has emerged among policymakers, academics, and other informed observers

around the world that better overall economic performance is achieved when the conduct 

of monetary policy is free from political control.10  Of course, we are accountable to the 

Congress and the American people.  The Congress has given us a job to do, and as long 

as I am a member of the Federal Reserve Board, I will do my utmost to carry out our 

mandate. 

Other Observations 

 The authors note that Federal Reserve asset purchases shorten the duration of debt 

held by the public, by the issuance of reserves to fund purchases of long-term securities.  

And shortening the maturity of the public debt does make any government more 

susceptible, in theory, to fiscal dominance.  There is also a general assumption that under 

fiscal dominance any government has a strong incentive to allow inflation to reduce the 

real value of the debt.  In the case of the United States, there is less to that than one might 

expect.  By shortening the duration of debt held by the public, asset purchases have also 

reduced any benefit to the government of an unexpected inflation.  More fundamentally, 

the liabilities that matter in the long term for the federal budget are those associated with 

health care and pension costs.  These liabilities are not nominal but real, and cannot be 

inflated away. 


Conclusion

Independence:  Theory and Evidence (Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press); Alberto Alesina and Lawrence H. 
Summers (1993), “Central Bank Independence and Macroeconomic Performance:  Some Comparative 
Evidence,” Journal of Money, Credit and Banking, vol. 25 (May), pp. 151-62; and Alex Cukierman,

Growth, Investment, and Real Rates,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39 
(December), pp. 95-140.

 I am not suggesting, and I do not expect, that the path ahead for monetary policy 

will be an easy one.  There are legitimate concerns associated with the costs and benefits 

of continuing asset purchases.  We may face challenges related to financial stability, as 

well as market function and inflation expectations.  I do not personally see fiscal 

dominance as high on the list of near term risks. 

I thank the authors for their interesting work.
