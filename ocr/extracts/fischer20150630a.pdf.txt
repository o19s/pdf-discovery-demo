I would like to thank the organizers of the conference for inviting me to this 

event.1  I have been invited in the past and had very much wanted to take part--especially 

in light of my having been born in Zambia and having received my schooling in Zambia, 

South Africa, and Zimbabwe--but somehow it never worked out.  I am therefore 

especially delighted finally to be here.  In my talk today, I will focus on both the 

challenges facing the Federal Reserve and those facing central banks of developing 

countries in our increasingly interconnected world.  But let me begin my remarks with a 

very brief digression on the history of central banking to put recent developments in 

context.   

Historical Context  

Today the great majority of countries have a central bank or an institution that 

fulfills the functions of a central bank.  But this was not always the case in the past.  Even 

after the advanced economies began to set up central banks, it was not widely accepted 

that smaller nations needed one.  Although the first central bank, the Swedish Riksbank, 

dates back to 1668, it was only in 1920 that the case for setting up a central bank in 

almost all countries was recognized among official circles in a resolution of the League 

of Nations’ conference in Brussels that year, which stipulated, among other things, that 

“in countries where there is no central bank of issue, one should be established.”2   

At the time, the main concern of the participants in the conference was the 

preservation of the international monetary order, by which was meant the possibility for 

both the private and public sectors of all countries to engage in domestic and international

Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.

transactions.  Since then, as it has become increasingly apparent that central banks can 

fulfill many functions, the number of central banks has expanded from 23 in 1920 to over 

160 currently.  And not only are there more central banks, but also the functions of 

central banks have continued to evolve. 

Until the Great Financial Crisis, both the practice and the theory of modern 

central banking revolved around the inflationary tendencies inherent in the conflict 

between the short- and long-run effects of monetary expansion and in the temptations of 

monetary financing of government spending.3  Taking into account the fact that many 

leading central banks have recently had to deal with below-target inflation, one would 

have to amend the previous sentence to say that the practice and the theory of modern 

central banking revolve around the benefits of keeping monetary policy independent of 

short-term political considerations--with respect to both the stabilization of the price level 

and the temptations of monetary financing of the budget. 

The earliest central banks provided financing for governments and helped develop 

the financial system, often by bringing order to the note issue.  As the practice of central 

banking developed during the 19th century, central banks took on the primary 

responsibility for protecting the stability of the financial system and the external value of 

the currency.  The mandate given to central banks in legislation passed in the 1930s and 

1940s typically included both monetary stability and the promotion of full employment 

and maximum output--and frequently other goals as well.

others (1994).

As the inflationary forces that eventually led to the collapse of the Bretton Woods 

system gathered strength in the 1960s and 1970s, the focus of monetary policy shifted to 

the maintenance of the domestic value of the currency.  In the decades that followed, 

central banks began to place greater emphasis on the stabilization of inflation, and that 

trend has continued to date.4 

Although this shift in emphasis originated in the advanced economies, emerging 

market and developing economies eventually followed suit, with many of them bringing 

down high rates of inflation and formally adopting an inflation targeting policy 

framework.  Even in countries without formal inflation targeting frameworks, 

stabilization of inflation remains an important objective, sometimes alongside other 

important objectives such as stabilization of the external value of the currency, 

stabilization of the macroeconomy, financial stability, and the development of the 

monetary and financial systems. 

The U.S. Economy and Monetary Policy 

In the United States, the Federal Reserve has, since 1977, been operating under a 

dual mandate to pursue maximum sustainable employment and price stability.5  Our main 

challenge, since the global financial crisis, has been to make rapid (or at least as rapid as 

possible) progress toward achieving these objectives.  While it has taken a long time, and 

extraordinary monetary policy actions, the U.S. economy is now close to full 

employment, with core inflation, at 1.2 percent, below our 2 percent inflation target, but, 

                                                 
4 Note that the reference here is to the stabilization of inflation rather than just keeping inflation low. 
5 While the dual mandate, with equal weight on employment and inflation, is exceptional among leading 
central banks, I believe that central banks with a legislated or declared sole or primary goal of maintaining 
price stability in practice rarely, if ever, act as if the level of employment or economic activity is of little 
concern.

in the view of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), likely to reach 2 percent 

within about two years.   

Let me provide an update on recent progress toward the attainment of these goals 

and its effects on the current stance of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. 

U.S. economic activity and inflation 

The U.S. economy slowed sharply in the first quarter of this year, with the most 

recent estimate being that real GDP declined 0.2 percent at an annual rate.  Household 

spending slowed, while both business investment and net exports declined.  Much of this 

slowdown seemed to reflect transitory factors, including harsh winter weather, labor 

disputes at West Coast ports, and probably statistical noise.  Confirming that view, the 

latest monthly data on real consumption provide welcome evidence that consumer 

demand is rebounding, and that economic activity likely expanded at an annual rate of 

about 2.5 percent in the second quarter. 

In addition, U.S. labor markets have continued to improve.  For the first five 

months of this year, payroll job gains have averaged 217,000 per month.  These gains are 

lower than those seen late last year but are still substantial, and they are above the rate 

needed to maintain the rate of unemployment at a constant rate of labor force 

participation.  The unemployment rate has moved lower this year and registered 

5.5 percent in May.  Both long-term unemployment and involuntary part-time 

employment declined as well.  While these developments represents considerable 

progress toward strengthening of the labor market, some room remains for further 

improvement.  


 - 5 - 

There are grounds for optimism that economic growth will be sufficient to 

promote further gains in labor market conditions.  Consumer spending should be helped 

by the earlier declines in oil prices because the boost to household incomes from the drop 

in oil prices is substantial.  Lower gasoline prices alone are estimated to be saving the 

typical household about $700 this year, thus providing households with the resources 

potentially to increase spending on other goods and services.  Moreover, consumer 

sentiment remains solid.  To be sure, with the U.S. now a major oil producer, lower oil 

prices have also had some negative effects on the U.S. economy.  Domestic oil drilling 

dropped sharply over the past few months, and sectors that support this activity have seen 

adverse effects.  But, on net, the United States should gain from the fall in oil prices, 

given that we are still a sizable importer of oil.  

On the negative side, the substantial appreciation of the dollar since last summer 

has been a significant headwind to the U.S. economy.  The weakness in industrial activity 

recently has been more pronounced in sectors that are highly exposed to international 

trade.  The first-quarter drop in net exports was very large, not only because of the 

appreciation of the dollar, but also in part reflecting--as mentioned above--port 

disruptions and possibly also some statistical noise.  Our analysis of the determinants of 

U.S. trade suggests that the recent appreciation of the dollar will restrain economic 

growth to some extent for a time even after these transitory factors have dissipated.   

Evaluating all of the indicators, the FOMC expects--as outlined in its June 17 

statement--that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand 

at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels 

consistent with the dual mandate.  


 - 6 - 

Turning to price stability, the other goal of our dual mandate, we have seen little 

progress toward inflation moving back to our target of 2 percent.  The 12-month change 

in headline personal consumption expenditures prices is now close to zero--though that 

very low level of inflation is temporary, in large part reflecting the large declines in 

energy prices around the turn of 2015.  The stronger dollar is also weighing on U.S. 

inflation by reducing the prices we pay for our imported goods and services.  Core 

inflation is running at 1-1/4 percent and will likely remain lower than we would like in 

the months ahead as the exchange rate effects pass through.  Over the medium term, the 

FOMC expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market tightens 

and the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices wane; indeed, energy 

prices appear to have stabilized. 

U.S. monetary policy 

Based on our reading of economic conditions, the FOMC decided at its June 17 

meeting to leave the federal funds rate target range at 0 to 1/4 percent.  Importantly, our 

June statement included no time-based guidance about the timing of liftoff of the policy 

rate from zero, emphasizing, instead, conditions that need to be satisfied before the 

federal funds rate target range is adjusted.  The Committee will assess progress--both 

realized and expected--toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent 

inflation.  Of course, because monetary policy affects the economy with a lag, we should 

not wait until we have reached our objectives to begin adjusting policy.  It goes without 

saying that we are also mindful of the risks of tightening policy prematurely.   

We anticipate that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal 

funds rate when we have seen further improvement in the labor market and are 


 - 7 - 

reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term.  

Thus, our policy will be data dependent, and the FOMC at upcoming meetings will weigh 

possible adjustments to the level of the target federal funds rate, based on its assessment 

of incoming data and the economic outlook.   

Regarding inflation, an important factor working to increase confidence in the 

inflation outlook will be continued improvement in the labor market.  Theoretical and 

empirical evidence suggests that inflation will eventually begin to rise as resource 

utilization tightens.  And while the link between wages and inflation can be tenuous, it is 

encouraging that we are seeing tentative indications of an acceleration in labor 

compensation.   

Once we begin to remove policy accommodation, the Committee’s assessment is 

that economic conditions will likely warrant raising the federal funds rate only gradually.  

Thus, we expect that the target federal funds rate will remain for some time below levels 

viewed as normal in the longer run.  But that is only a forecast, and monetary policy will, 

in practice, be determined by the data--primarily data on inflation and unemployment. 

What about financial stability?  We are aware of the possibility that low interest 

rates maintained for a prolonged period could prompt an excessive buildup in leverage or 

cause underwriting standards to erode as investors take on risks they cannot measure or 

manage appropriately in a reach for yield.  At this point, the evidence does not indicate 

that such vulnerabilities pose a significant threat, but we are carefully monitoring 

developments in this area.

U.S. Monetary Policy Spillovers and Global Interest Rates 

As we consider the decision of policy rate normalization, we are mindful of 

possible spillovers to other economies, including emerging market and developing 

economies.  In an interconnected world, fulfilling the Federal Reserve’s objectives under 

its dual mandate requires that we pay close attention to how our own actions affect other 

countries and how developments abroad, in turn, spill back into U.S. economic 

conditions.   

In order to minimize the likelihood of surprises and thus avoid creating 

unnecessary market and policy volatility, we are striving to communicate our policy 

strategy clearly and transparently.  Beyond communicating our intentions, we also 

emphasize that monetary policy normalization in the United States will occur in the 

context of a strengthening U.S. economy, which should benefit the emerging market and 

developing economies. 

Still, one feature of the era after the first increase of the federal funds rate will, in 

all likelihood, be higher U.S. and global interest rates compared with their extraordinarily 

low levels of recent years.  The increase in global interest rates could cause investors to 

adjust their portfolios, triggering capital outflows from emerging market and developing 

economies.   

The financing needs of emerging market and developing countries remain 

substantial.  As tomorrow’s session on the outlook for Africa’s debt capital markets will 

discuss, many African countries were able to issue bonds on the international financial 

markets in recent years--in some cases, for the first time in history.  This development is 


 - 9 - 

due to the significant economic progress of the continent of the past several years and to 

commodity booms, ample global liquidity, and low interest rates.   

Higher global interest rates could limit the possibilities for governments to 

finance their projects or budgets on the same favorable terms.  The reduced ability of 

governments to finance their needs will likely increase the challenges faced by central 

banks in their efforts to assist the economic growth and development agendas of their 

national governments. 

Emerging market and developing economies have generally done a good job of 

reducing their financial and economic vulnerabilities over the past couple of decades.  

For example, since the 1990s, many of them have made remarkable progress in reducing 

inflation, improving government debt ratios, building foreign reserves, and better 

regulating and capitalizing their banking systems.  These improved economic 

fundamentals should bolster their resilience should normalization of monetary policy in 

the United States and some other advanced economies lead to financial market stresses.  

Even so, policymakers will be better positioned to cope with shocks, both internal and 

external, if they continue to strengthen these economic fundamentals. 

Monetary Policy in Developing Countries 

As mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve has operated under a dual mandate of 

price stability and maximum employment, which has worked well for the U.S. economy.  

When it comes to central banking more generally, I doubt that there is any particular 

monetary policy framework that is suitable for all countries for all times.  The central 

bank’s choice of monetary policy framework should depend on the objectives it aims to 

achieve, on the challenges that the economy faces, and on the structure of the financial 


 - 10 - 

markets and the economy in which it operates.  And it is likely that the monetary policy 

framework will change over time as the domestic economy and the international financial 

system develop. 

The exchange rate regime is a key consideration.  In recent decades, developing 

economies have experienced increasing capital mobility and financial integration into the 

global economy.  Over the longer term, this is a welcome development that will help 

meet the substantial financing needs of the private and public sectors, but greater 

financial integration and financial flows also complicate monetary policy in an 

environment in which exchange rate considerations are important--and they are generally 

very important.  These are small open economies in which external shocks are often 

large, and the excessive volatility inherent in free-floating exchange rates can be costly.  

As a consequence, many developing and emerging market countries both intervene in the 

foreign exchange markets and impose restrictions on capital inflows and outflows. 

Why not simply peg the exchange rate?  According to the impossible triad, or the 

more sophisticated version developed by Hélène Rey, the impossible duo, a pegged rate, 

combined with capital mobility, makes it difficult for monetary policy to be used 

independently to achieve macroeconomic stabilization and price stability.6  Nonetheless, 

some economies have successfully implemented pegged exchange rates.  Hong Kong and 

Francophone Africa are leading examples.   

Properly managed, some flexibility of exchange rates can help economies absorb 

external shocks, including swings in prices of commodities to which these economies are 

still heavily exposed.  Accordingly, there has been a shift toward flexible, but managed, 

                                                 
6 See Rey (2015).

exchange rate systems among emerging market and developing economies.  However, 

none of us should underestimate the difficulties of managing the exchange rate and of 

developing knowledge about when and how much to allow the exchange rate to move in 

response to domestic and external economic shocks.   

Even beyond the management of the exchange rate, central banks in developing 

countries face difficult challenges in developing their monetary policy frameworks.  For 

many years, the standard International Monetary Fund approach to monetary policy--

which embodied the monetary approach to the balance of payments--emphasized money 

targets.  But this approach has become less tenable as economies have evolved and 

matured.  As you know, the effectiveness of such a framework depends, among other 

things, on the stability of the money demand function and on the structural relationship 

between monetary aggregates and macroeconomic variables.  These relationships tend to 

shift as the financial system develops, making money targeting frameworks less 

effective--as we know from the historical experience of monetary policies in advanced 

economies. 

For this reason, advanced economies abandoned them, and some emerging market 

economies followed suit, generally, in favor of inflation targeting frameworks, with 

short-term interest rates as the main instruments and the use of open market operations to 

control the liquidity in the economy.  However the conditions necessary for full-blown 

inflation targeting achieved through adjustment of policy interest rates may not be present 

in some of these economies.     

In the advanced economies and some emerging market economies, financial 

systems are relatively well developed, deep, and diversified, which facilitates the conduct 


 - 12 - 

of monetary policy through open market operations.  In many of the developing 

countries, however, although financial systems are developing rapidly, they remain small 

and not well diversified, hindering the ability of central banks to conduct open market 

operations.  Indeed, in many countries, interbank markets are still underdeveloped, and, 

even though some central banks use policy rates, changes to these policy rates have only 

limited effect on other interest rates and on the economy more generally.  Thus, the 

ambitions of developing countries to modernize their monetary policy frameworks have 

to proceed in parallel with further efforts to develop the market institutions necessary to 

conduct monetary policy in a conventional way.7    

Concluding Remarks 

Central banking as a profession has come a long way, striving to adapt itself to the 

challenges faced by economies over time, and both the practice and theory of central 

banking will continue to evolve.  Like others, central banks in developing countries are 

making strides in modernizing their policy frameworks and better adapting them to the 

problems that their economies face.  Nonetheless, significant challenges remain to 

develop financial systems and accelerate financial inclusion, to enhance the effectiveness 

of monetary policy, and to further expand the institutional and operational capacities of 

central banks.   

I wish you--the governors and high officials of African central banks--well in 

carrying out your critical and difficult responsibilities, and I look forward to discussing 

with you the policy issues that you confront.
