Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

 
at the 

 
Economic Club of New York 

 
New York, New York 


April 11, 2011 





 Good afternoon.  For more than a century, the Economic Club of New York has 

provided an influential forum for the discussion of social, political and economic 

challenges facing the nation, and I appreciate very much your inviting me to speak today.  

My comments will focus on recent increases in commodity prices and the effects of those 

developments on the outlook for inflation, the economic recovery now under way, and 

the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  Let me emphasize at the outset that these 

remarks reflect my own views and not those of others in the Federal Reserve System.1    

 Since early last summer, the prices of oil, agricultural products, and other raw 

materials have risen significantly.  For example, the price of Brent crude oil has risen 

more than 70 percent and the price of corn has more than doubled; more broadly, the 

Commodity Research Bureau’s index of non-fuel commodity prices has risen roughly 40 

percent.  The imprint of these increases has become increasingly visible in overall 

measures of inflation.  For example, inflation as measured by the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures (PCE) moved up to an annual rate of about 4 percent over the 

three months ending in February after having averaged less than 1-1/2 percent over the 

preceding two years.  Moreover, survey data suggest that surging prices for gasoline and 

food have pushed up households’ near-term inflation expectations and are making 

consumers less confident about their economic circumstances.   

 Some observers have attributed the recent boom in commodity prices to the 

highly accommodative stance of U.S. monetary policy, including the marked expansion 

of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the maintenance of the target federal funds 

rate at exceptionally low levels.  Such an interpretation of recent developments naturally 

                                                 
1 I am indebted to Board staff members Christopher Erceg, Steven Kamin, David Lebow, Andrew Levin, 
Trevor Reeve, David Reifschneider, Stacey Tevlin, and William Wascher for their assistance in preparing 
these remarks.

leads to the conclusion that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should move 

promptly toward firmer monetary conditions.  Indeed, some have even raised the specter 

of a return to the high inflation of the 1970s in arguing for the urgency of monetary 

policy tightening. 

 Increases in energy and food prices are, without doubt, creating significant 

hardships for many people, both here in the United States and abroad.  However, the 

implications of these increases for how the Federal Reserve should respond in terms of 

monetary policy must be considered very carefully.  In my remarks today, I will make the 

case that recent developments in commodity prices can be explained largely by rising 

global demand and disruptions to global supply rather than by Federal Reserve policy.   

Moreover, empirical analysis suggests that these developments, at least thus far, are 

unlikely to have persistent effects on consumer inflation or to derail the recovery.  

Critically, so long as longer-run inflation expectations remain stable, the increases seen 

thus far in commodity prices and headline consumer inflation are not likely, in my view, 

to become embedded in the wage and price setting process and therefore are not likely to 

warrant any substantial shift in the stance of monetary policy.  An accommodative 

monetary policy continues to be appropriate because unemployment remains elevated, 

and, even now, measures of underlying inflation are somewhat below the levels that 

FOMC participants judge to be consistent, over the longer run, with our statutory 

mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.   

 While I continue to anticipate a gradual economic recovery in the context of price 

stability, I do recognize that further large and persistent increases in commodity prices 

could pose significant risks to both inflation and real activity that could necessitate a 


 - 3 -

policy response.  The FOMC is determined to ensure that we never again repeat the 

experience of the late 1960s and 1970s, when the Federal Reserve did not respond 

forcefully enough to rising inflation and allowed longer-term inflation expectations to 

drift upward.  Consequently, we are paying close attention to the evolution of inflation 

and inflation expectations.  

Sources of the Recent Rise in Commodity Prices 

 Let me now turn to a discussion of the sources of the recent increase in 

commodity prices.  In my view, the run-up in the prices of crude oil, food, and other 

commodities we’ve seen over the past year can best be explained by the fundamentals of 

global supply and demand rather than by the stance of U.S. monetary policy.   

 In particular, a rapid pace of expansion of the emerging market economies 

(EMEs), which played a major role in driving up commodity prices from 2002 to 2008, 

appears to be the key factor driving the more recent run-up as well.  Although real 

activity in the EMEs slowed appreciably immediately following the financial crisis, those 

economies resumed expanding briskly by the middle of 2009 after global financial 

conditions began improving, with China--which has accounted for roughly half of global 

growth in oil consumption over the past decade--again leading the way.  By contrast, 

demand for commodities by the United States and other developed economies has grown 

very slowly; for example, in 2010 overall U.S. consumption of crude oil was lower in 

than in 1999 even though U.S. real gross domestic output (GDP) has risen more than 20 

percent since then.  On the supply side, heightened concerns about oil production in the 

Middle East and North Africa have recently put significant upward pressure on oil prices, 


 - 4 -

while droughts in China and Russia and other weather-related supply disruptions have 

contributed to the jump in global food prices.   

 In contrast, the arguments linking the run-up in commodity prices to the stance of 

U.S. monetary policy do not seem to hold up to close scrutiny.  In particular, some 

observers have pointed to dollar depreciation, speculative behavior, and international 

monetary linkages as key channels through which accommodative U.S. monetary policy 

might be exacerbating the boom in commodity markets.  Let me address each of these 

possibilities in turn. 

 First, it does not seem reasonable to attribute much of the rise in commodity 

prices to movements in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  Since early last 

summer, the dollar has depreciated about 10 percent against other major currencies, and 

of that change, my sense is that only a limited portion should be attributed to the Federal 

Reserve’s initiation of a second round of securities purchases.  By comparison, as I noted 

earlier, crude oil prices have risen more than 70 percent over the same period, and 

nonfuel commodity prices are up roughly 40 percent.  Put another way, commodity prices 

have risen markedly in all major currencies, not just in terms of U.S. dollars, suggesting 

that the evolution of the foreign exchange value of the dollar can explain only a small 

fraction of those increases.   

 A second potential concern is that U.S. monetary policy is boosting commodity 

prices by reducing the cost of holding inventories or by fomenting “carry trades” and 

other forms of speculative behavior.  But here, too, the evidence is not compelling.  Price 

increases have been prevalent across a wide range of commodities, even those that are 

associated with little or no trading in futures markets.  Moreover, if speculative 


 - 5 -

transactions were the primary cause of rising commodity prices, we would expect to see 

mounting inventories of commodities as speculators hoarded such commodities, whereas 

in fact stocks of crude oil and agricultural products have generally been falling since last 

summer.2       

A third concern expressed by some observers is that the exceptionally low level of 

U.S. interest rates has translated into excessive monetary stimulus in the EMEs.  In 

particular, even though their economies have been expanding quite rapidly, many EMEs 

have been reluctant to raise their own interest rates because of concerns that higher rates 

could lead to further capital inflows and boost the value of their currencies.  Some argue 

that their disinclination to tighten monetary policy has in turn resulted in economic 

overheating that has generated further upward pressures on commodity prices.   

I do not think this explanation accounts for much of the surge in commodity 

prices, in part because I believe that the bulk of the rapid economic growth in EMEs 

mainly reflects fundamental improvements in productive capacity, as those countries 

become integrated into the global economy, rather than loose monetary policies.  

Irrespective of monetary conditions in the advanced foreign economies, it is clear that the 

monetary and fiscal authorities in the EMEs have a range of policy tools to address any 

potential for overheating in their economies if they choose to do so.  Indeed, in light of 

the relatively high levels of resource utilization and inflationary pressures that many 

EMEs face at present, monetary tightening and currency appreciation might well be 

appropriate for those economies.  


                                                 
2 Longer-dated futures suggest that the prices of some important commodities, such as cotton, are expected 
to fall or at least remain flat in coming years; there is little incentive to speculate in commodities whose 
prices are not expected to increase further.

The Outlook for Consumer Prices 

Turning now to the outlook for U.S. consumer prices, I anticipate that the recent 

surge in commodity prices will cause headline inflation to remain elevated over the next 

few months.  However, I expect that consumer inflation will subsequently revert to an 

underlying trend that remains subdued, so long as increases in commodity prices 

moderate and longer run inflation expectations remain reasonably well-anchored.     

Underlying Inflation Trends 

Focusing on inflation prospects over the medium term is essential to the 

formulation of monetary policy because, due to lags, the medium term is the timeframe 

over which the FOMC’s actions can influence the economy.  For this purpose, 

economists have constructed a variety of measures to separate underlying persistent 

movements in inflation from more transitory fluctuations.  These measures include “core” 

inflation, which excludes changes in the prices of food and energy, and “trimmed mean” 

inflation, which exclude prices exhibiting the largest increases or decreases in any given 

month. 

No single measure of underlying inflation is perfect, but it is notable that these 

measures have exhibited a remarkably consistent pattern since the onset of the recession:  

All show the underlying inflation rate declining markedly to a level somewhat below the 

rate of 2 percent or a bit less that FOMC participants consider to be consistent with the 

Fed’s dual mandate.  For example, core PCE price inflation stood at less than 1 percent 

over the 12 months ending in February, down from 2-1/2 percent over the year prior to 

the recession.  Trimmed-mean measures of inflation have also trended down over the past 

couple of years and are now close to 1 percent.   


 - 7 -

I want to emphasize that this focus on core and other inflation measures that may 

exclude recent increases in the cost of gasoline and other household essentials is not 

intended to downplay the importance of these items in the cost of living or to lower the 

bar on the definition of price stability.  The Federal Reserve aims to stabilize inflation 

across the entire basket of goods and services that households purchase, including energy 

and food.  Rather, we pay attention to core inflation and similar measures because, in 

light of the volatility of food and energy prices, core inflation has been a better forecaster 

of overall inflation in the medium term than overall inflation itself has been over the past 

25 years.3  

In my view, the marked decline in these trend measures of inflation since the 

intensification of the crisis largely reflects very low rates of resource utilization.  Strong 

productivity gains have also played a role in holding down inflation because, together 

with low wage inflation, they have markedly restrained the rise in firms’ production 

costs.  With resource slack likely to diminish only gradually over the next few years, it 

seems reasonable to anticipate that underlying inflation will remain subdued for some 

time, provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.   

Longer-Run Inflation Expectations 

In this regard, surveys and financial market data indicate that longer-run inflation 

expectations remain reasonably well anchored even though near-term inflation 

expectations have jumped in the wake of the surge in commodity prices.  For example, 

the Thomson Reuters/ University of Michigan Survey of Consumers indicates that 

median inflation expectations for the coming year moved up about 1-1/4 percentage 

                                                 
3   Overall inflation and core inflation regularly deviate from one another.  When this has occurred over the 
past 25 years, the tendency has been for overall inflation to subsequently converge to core inflation, and not 
the other way around.

points in March, whereas the median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years 

increased only 1/4 percentage point.  While such movements obviously bear watching, I 

would note that such a combination--namely, a substantial jump in near-term inflation 

expectations coupled with a relatively modest uptick in longer-run expectations--has 

often accompanied previous sharp increases in gasoline prices, and when it did, those 

movements were largely reversed within a few months.4 

Information derived from the Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) 

market also suggests that financial market participants’ longer-term inflation expectations 

remain well anchored even as the near-term outlook for inflation has shifted upward.  In 

particular, while the carry-adjusted measure of inflation compensation for the next five 

years has increased about 1/4 percentage point since earlier this year, forward inflation 

compensation at longer horizons is roughly unchanged on net.  Much of the increase in 

five-year inflation compensation has been associated with the surge in food and energy 

prices, and the level of this measure appears consistent with a normal cyclical recovery 

after adjusting for those effects. 

Commodity Prices and Inflation 

Now I would like to explain in further detail why I anticipate that recent increases 

in commodity prices are likely to have only transitory effects on headline inflation.  The 

current configuration of quotes on futures contracts--which can serve as a reasonable 

benchmark in gauging the outlook for commodity prices--suggests that these prices will 

roughly stabilize near current levels or even decline in some cases.  If that outcome 

materializes, the prices of gasoline and heating oil are likely to flatten out fairly soon, and 

retail food prices are likely to continue rising briskly for only a few more months.  
                                                 
4 An example of this pattern was seen in the months following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.   


 - 9 -

Consequently, the direct effects of the surge in commodity prices on headline consumer 

inflation should diminish sharply over coming months. 

Over time, I anticipate that the recent surge in commodity prices will also affect 

the prices of a broader range of consumer goods and services that use these commodities 

as inputs.  Many firms are seeing such costs escalate and will pass along at least part of 

these increased raw materials costs to their customers.  Nevertheless, I expect the overall 

inflationary consequences of these pass-through effects to be modest and transitory, 

provided that longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Moreover, labor 

costs per unit of output--the single largest component of the unit cost of producing goods 

and services in the business sector--are essentially unchanged since 2007, owing to both 

moderate wage increases and solid productivity gains.  I expect that nominal wage 

growth and labor costs will continue to be restrained by slack in resource utilization.  

Indeed, it would be difficult to get a sustained increase in inflation as long as growth in 

nominal wages remains as low as we have seen recently.   

My expectation regarding the transitory effects of commodity price shocks on 

consumer inflation is supported by simulation results from the FRB/US model--a 

macroeconometric model developed at the Federal Reserve Board and used extensively 

for policy analysis.  Starting from a situation in which inflation is running at 2 percent 

and households and firms expect the FOMC to keep it there in the longer run, the model 

predicts that a persistent increase of $25 per barrel in the price of crude oil--that is, a rise 

similar to what we’ve experienced since last summer--would cause the PCE price index 

to rise at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent over the first two quarters following the 


 - 10 -

shock.  Beyond that horizon, however, total PCE inflation drops quickly to about 2-1/4 

percent and then declines gradually back to its longer-run rate of 2 percent.         

These fairly modest and transitory effects of an oil price shock are also consistent 

with the response of the U.S. economy to the dramatic run-up in commodity prices from 

2002 to 2008.  Indeed, while oil prices more than quadrupled over that period, measures 

of underlying inflation remained close to 2 percent.  In my view, that outcome was 

crucially dependent on the stability of longer-run inflation expectations, which in turn 

limited the pass-through of higher production costs to consumer prices.   

Risks to the Inflation Outlook 

I have argued that recent commodity price shocks are likely to have only a 

transitory effect on inflation.  But even if such a trajectory for inflation is most likely, 

some specific risks must be considered.  First, while futures markets suggest that 

commodity prices will stabilize near current levels, these prices cannot be predicted with 

much confidence.  For example, oil prices could move markedly higher or lower as a 

consequence of geopolitical developments, changes in production capacity, or shifts in 

the growth outlook of the EMEs.   

In addition, the indirect effects of the commodity price surge could be amplified 

substantially if longer-run inflation expectations started drifting upward or if nominal 

wages began rising sharply as workers pressed employers to offset realized or prospective 

declines in their purchasing power.   

Indeed, a key lesson from the experience of the late 1960s and 1970s is that the 

stability of longer-run inflation expectations cannot be taken for granted.  At that time, 

the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy framework was opaque, its measures of resource 


 - 11 -

utilization were flawed, and its policy actions generally followed a stop-start pattern that 

undermined public confidence in the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep inflation 

under control.  Consequently, longer-term inflation expectations became unmoored, and 

nominal wages and prices spiraled upward as workers sought compensation for past price 

increases and as firms responded to accelerating labor costs with further increases in 

prices.  That wage-price spiral was eventually arrested by the Federal Reserve under 

Chairman Paul Volcker, but only at the cost of a severe recession in the early 1980s.   

Since then, the Federal Reserve has remained determined to avoid those mistakes 

and to keep inflation low and stable.  It will be important to closely monitor the state of 

longer-term inflation expectations to ensure that the Federal Reserve’s credibility, which 

has been built up over the past three decades, remains fully intact. 

The Outlook for the Real Economy 
 
 Turning now to the real economy, real gross domestic product (GDP) has been 

rising since mid-2009 and now exceeds its level just prior to the onset of the recession.  

While GDP growth during late 2009 and early 2010 was largely the result of inventory 

restocking and fiscal stimulus, private final sales growth has picked up over the past six 

months--an encouraging sign.  At the same time, measures of business sentiment have 

generally returned to pre-recession levels, factory output has been expanding apace, and 

the unemployment rate has dropped by a percentage point over the past few months. 

Real consumer spending--which had been rising at a brisk pace in the fall--slowed 

somewhat around the turn of the year, and measures of consumer sentiment declined in 

March.  Those developments may partly reflect the extent to which higher food and 

energy prices have sapped households’ purchasing power.  More generally, however, as 


 - 12 -

the improvement in the labor market deepens and broadens, households should regain 

some of the confidence they lost during the recession, providing an important boost to 

spending.     

Broad Contours of the Outlook 

Nonetheless, a sharp rebound in economic activity--like those that often follow 

deep recessions--does not appear to be in the offing.  One key factor restraining the pace 

of recovery is the construction sector, which continues to be hampered by a considerable 

overhang of vacant homes and commercial properties and remains in the doldrums.  In 

addition, spending by state and local governments seems likely to remain limited by tight 

budget conditions.   

Moreover, while the labor market has recently shown some signs of life, job 

opportunities are still relatively scarce.  The unemployment rate is down from its peak, 

but at 8.8 percent, it still remains quite elevated.  And even the decline that we’ve seen to 

date partly reflects a drop in labor force participation, because people are counted as 

unemployed only if they are actively looking for work.  

Some observers have argued that the high unemployment rate primarily reflects 

structural factors such as a longer duration of unemployment benefits and difficulties in 

matching available workers with vacant jobs rather than a deficiency of aggregate 

demand.  In my view, however, the preponderance of available evidence and research 

suggests that these alternative structural explanations cannot account for the bulk of the 

rise in the unemployment rate during the recession.  For example, if mismatches were of 

central importance, we would not expect to see high rates of unemployment across the 

vast majority of occupations and industries.  Instead, I see weak demand for labor as the 


 - 13 -

predominant explanation of why the rate of unemployment remains elevated and rates of 

resource utilization more generally are still well below normal levels. 

Commodity Prices and the Real Economy 

As I have indicated, the recent run-up in commodity prices is likely to weigh 

somewhat on consumer spending in coming months because it puts a painful squeeze on 

the pocketbooks of American households.5  In particular, higher oil prices lower 

American income overall because the United States is a major oil importer and hence 

much of the proceeds are transferred abroad.  Monetary policy cannot directly alter this 

transfer of income abroad, which primarily reflects a change in relative prices driven by 

global demand and supply balances, not conditions in the United States.  Thus, an 

increase in the price of crude oil acts like a tax on U.S. households, and like other taxes, 

tends to have a dampening effect on consumer spending.6   

The surge in commodity prices may also dampen business spending.  Higher food 

and energy prices should boost investment in agriculture, drilling, and mining but are 

likely to weigh on investment spending by firms in other sectors.  Assuming these firms 

are unable to fully pass through higher input costs into prices, they will experience some 

compression in their profit margins, at least in the short run, thereby causing a decline in 

the marginal return on investment in most forms of equipment and structures.7  

Moreover, to the extent that higher oil prices are associated with greater uncertainty about 

the economic outlook, businesses may decide to put off key investment decisions until 

                                                 
5 It should be noted that commodity price increases do boost the incomes of commodity producers.  For 
example, the recent surge in food prices has generally boosted the incomes of farmers and others with ties 
to the agricultural sector. 
6 Staff analysis at the Federal Reserve Board indicates that a dollar increase in retail gasoline prices--a little 
more than has occurred over the last year--reduces real household disposable income by nearly 1 percent 
and hence tends to exert a significant drag on consumer spending. 
7 Increased investment in energy-conserving technologies would likely provide a partial offset to the 
various factors damping capital spending outside the commodity-producing sectors.   


 - 14 -

that uncertainty subsides.  Finally, with higher oil prices weighing on household income, 

weaker consumer spending could discourage business capital spending to some degree. 

Fortunately, considerable evidence suggests that the effect of energy price shocks 

on the real economy has decreased substantially over the past several decades.  During 

the period before the creation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 

(OPEC), cheap oil encouraged households to purchase gas-guzzling cars while firms had 

incentives to use energy-intensive production techniques.  Consequently, when oil prices 

quadrupled in 1973-74, that degree of energy dependence resulted in substantial adverse 

effects on real economic activity.  Since then, however, energy efficiency in both 

production and consumption has improved markedly. 

Consequently, while the recent run-up in commodity prices is likely to weigh 

somewhat on consumer and business spending in coming months, I do not anticipate that 

those developments will greatly impede the economic recovery as long as these trends do 

not continue much further.  For example, the simulation of the FRB/US model that I 

noted earlier indicates that a persistent increase of $25 per barrel in oil prices would 

reduce the level of real GDP about 1/2 percent over the first year and a bit more 

thereafter.  The magnitude of that effect seems broadly consistent with the estimates of 

professional forecasters; for example, the Blue Chip consensus outlook for real GDP 

growth has edged down only modestly in recent months. 

Monetary Policy Considerations 
 

Let me now turn to the stance of monetary policy.  As you know, monetary policy 

has been highly accommodative since the financial crisis intensified.  In December 2008, 

the FOMC lowered the target federal funds rate to near zero and started to provide 


 - 15 -

forward guidance concerning its likely future path.  As in its statements since March 

2009, the Committee reiterated last month that “economic conditions, including low rates 

of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are 

likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended 

period.”  In addition, the FOMC has purchased a substantial volume of agency debt, 

agency mortgage-backed securities, and longer-term Treasury securities.  The Committee 

initiated a second round of Treasury purchases last November and has indicated that it 

intends to complete those purchases by the end of June.  My reading of the evidence is 

that these securities purchases have proven effective in easing financial conditions, 

thereby promoting a stronger pace of economic recovery and checking undesirable 

disinflationary pressures. 

I believe this accommodative policy stance is still appropriate because 

unemployment remains elevated, longer-run inflation expectations remain well anchored, 

and measures of underlying inflation are somewhat low relative to the rate of 2 percent or 

a bit less that Committee participants judge to be consistent over the longer term with our 

statutory mandate.  However, there can be no question that sometime down the road, as 

the recovery gathers steam, it will become necessary for the FOMC to withdraw the 

monetary policy accommodation we have put in place.  That process will involve both 

raising the target federal funds rate over time and gradually normalizing the size and 

composition of our security holdings.  Importantly, we are confident that we have the 

tools in place to withdraw monetary stimulus, and we are prepared to use those tools 

when the right time comes. 


 - 16 -

 Of course, there are risks to the outlook that may affect the timing and pace of 

monetary policy firming.  In my view, however, even additional large and persistent 

shocks to commodity prices might not call for any substantial change in the course of 

monetary policy as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored and measures of 

underlying inflation continue to be subdued.  As I noted earlier, a surge in commodity 

prices unavoidably impairs performance with respect to both aspects of the Federal 

Reserve’s dual mandate:  Such shocks push up unemployment and raise inflation.  A 

policy easing might alleviate the effects on employment but would tend to exacerbate the 

inflationary effects; conversely, policy firming might mitigate the rise in inflation but 

would contribute to an even weaker economic recovery.  Under such circumstances, an 

appropriate balance in fulfilling our dual mandate might well call for the FOMC to leave 

the stance of monetary policy broadly unchanged.  

 That said, in light of the experience of the 1970s, it is clear that we cannot be 

complacent about the stability of inflation expectations, and we must be prepared to take 

decisive action to keep these expectations stable.  For example, if a continued run-up in 

commodity prices appeared to be sparking a wage-price spiral, then underlying inflation 

could begin trending upward at an unacceptable pace.  Such circumstances would clearly 

call for policy firming to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain firmly 

anchored. 

Conclusion 
 
 In summary, the surge in commodity prices over the past year appears to be 

largely attributable to a combination of rising global demand and disruptions in global 

supply.  These developments seem unlikely to have persistent effects on consumer 


 - 17 -

inflation or to derail the economic recovery and hence do not, in my view, warrant any 

substantial shift in the stance of monetary policy.  However, my colleagues and I are 

paying close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations, and we are 

prepared to act as needed to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent 

with our statutory mandate.
