Our panel’s topic--“Monetary Policy Spillovers and Cooperation in a Global 

Economy”--is surely a timely one.  I will offer brief introductory thoughts and then 

discuss some recent research by Federal Reserve Board economists that has bearing on 

these matters.1   

The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy is motivated by the dual mandate, which 

calls upon us to achieve stable prices and maximum sustainable employment.  While 

these objectives are stated as domestic concerns, as a practical matter, economic and 

financial developments around the world can have significant effects on our own 

economy and vice versa.  Thus, the pursuit of our mandate requires that we understand 

and incorporate into our policy decision-making the anticipated effects of these 

interconnections.  And the dollar’s role as the world’s primary reserve, transaction, and 

funding currency requires us to consider global developments to help ensure our own 

financial stability. 

Since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has pursued a highly 

accommodative monetary policy, which has had important effects on asset prices and 

global investment flows.  With unconventional tools, the scale and scope of these effects 

were difficult to predict ex ante.  Nor is it possible to predict with confidence how 

markets will react day to day as policy returns to normal.  The Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) has gone to great lengths to provide transparency about its policy 

intentions.  Yet, since Chairman Bernanke first discussed the end of the asset purchase 

program in mid-2013, volatility has surprised both on the upside (the “taper tantrum”) 

and on the downside (the actual taper and the low volatility throughout most of 2014).  In

my view, while market volatility will continue to ebb and flow, these fluctuations are not 

likely to have important implications for policy.  The path of policy will depend on the 

progress of the economy toward fulfilment of the dual mandate. 

Overall, accommodative monetary policy seems to have provided significant 

support for U.S. growth.  And, of course, a strong U.S. economy contributes to strong 

growth around the globe, particularly in the emerging market economies (EMEs).  But 

what of the so-called spillovers in the form of flows into, and out of, EMEs, whose 

financial sectors are small compared with global investment flows?  Such spillovers 

could merely reflect investor responses to changing differentials between rates of return 

abroad and in the United States.  But these spillovers could also reflect shifts in investor 

preferences for risk.  

By design, accommodative monetary policy--whether conventional or 

unconventional--supports economic activity in part by creating incentives for investors to 

take more risk.  Such risk-taking can show up in domestic financial markets, in the 

international investments of U.S. investors, and even, ultimately, in general risk attitudes 

toward foreign financial markets.  Distinguishing between appropriate and excessive risk-

taking is difficult, however. 

I now turn to some recent research on whether there has been an increase in the 

riskiness of our investments abroad and whether such increases might be traced to the 

current low-interest rate environment.  Many studies of the pre-crisis period document 

the pro-cyclical nature of bank lending and leverage, and the buildup of risk-taking and

leverage by banks.2  It is much harder to find evidence that low interest rates have led to 

increased post-crisis risk-taking by U.S. banks.  Growth in overall lending by U.S. banks 

has been modest at best.  However, some pockets of increased risk-taking by banks and 

other investors are observable in domestic markets, such as leveraged loans.  And on the 

international front, there has been a notable increase in syndicated loan originations.   

Recent research by Board staff, using a database of loans primarily to U.S. 

borrowers but also to some foreign borrowers, suggests that lenders have indeed 

originated an increased number of risky syndicated loans post-crisis, based on the 

assessed probability of default as reported to bank supervisors (figure 1).3  Regression 

results confirm that the average probability of default is significantly inversely related to 

U.S. long-term interest rates.  This increase in riskiness of syndicated loans post-crisis 

has been accompanied by a shift in the composition of loan holders:  An increasing share 

is now held not by banks but by hedge, pension, and other investment funds (figure 2).  

These nonbank investors also tend to hold loans with higher average credit risk (figure 3).  

These data suggest that a tougher regulatory environment may have made U.S.-based 

bank originators unable or unwilling to hold risky loans on their balance sheets.  Related 

work by the same researchers, using a database with more-extensive coverage of loans to

foreign borrowers, shows a similar pattern of increased risky loan underwriting by 

international lenders, an increase that is also significantly inversely related to U.S. 

interest rates.  Together, these results suggest a potential spillover from accommodative 

U.S. monetary policy through increased risk-taking in syndicated loans globally, although 

preliminary results also indicate that investors still require extra return for this extra risk.   

Another area in which to look for links between low interest rates and risk-taking 

is in cross-border securities purchases.  The role of low interest rates in advanced 

economies in encouraging capital flows to EMEs where returns are higher has been a 

familiar theme.4  And recent studies have found that asset prices in EMEs do respond 

systematically to U.S. monetary policy shocks.5   

For evidence of increased risk-taking in cross-border investment, let’s look at the 

composition of U.S. investors’ foreign bond portfolios.  Although emerging market bonds 

remain a relatively small proportion of the aggregate U.S. cross-border bond portfolio 

(figure 4), within foreign government bonds, U.S. investors have modestly shifted their 

portfolio shares toward higher-yielding bonds of emerging market sovereigns (figure 5).  

Ex post, these portfolio reallocations delivered a higher return to U.S. investors on this 

part of their portfolio relative to what they would have received if they had left portfolio

compositions unchanged at the average shares in 2008 and 2009, but at a cost to the 

portfolio’s credit quality (figure 6).  Regression results confirm that in choosing among 

foreign government bonds, U.S. investors have put more weight on returns since the 

crisis.6 

But search for higher returns has not been the only motivation for international 

investors post-crisis:  Demand for liquid high-grade “safe” or money-like assets has also 

increased from foreign official investors for investment of foreign exchange reserves, 

from pension funds and other institutions who face portfolio allocation constraints or 

regulatory requirements, and from investment strategies requiring cash-like assets for 

margining and other collateral purposes.  Some shift to safe assets is also seen in U.S. 

portfolios:  U.S. investors actively rebalanced their holdings of foreign financial sector 

bonds toward those with higher credit ratings, but at some cost in returns (figure 7; figure 

8).7   

Taken together, developments in U.S. bond portfolios do not indicate a worrisome 

pickup in risk-taking in external investments.  But it is important to recognize that 

portfolio reallocations that seem relatively small for U.S. investors can loom large from 

the perspective of the foreign recipients of these flows.  At roughly $400 billion at the 

end of 2012, emerging market bonds accounted for a tiny fraction of the roughly 

$25 trillion in bonds held by U.S. investors.  But to the recipient countries, these holdings 

can account for a large fraction of their bond markets.  Even relatively small changes in

these U.S. holdings can generate large asset price responses, as was certainly the case in 

the summer of 2013.  Likewise, a reassessment of risk-return tradeoffs could disrupt 

financing for projects that are dependent on the willingness of investors to participate in 

global syndicated loan markets.  

We take the consequences of such spillovers seriously, and the Federal Reserve is 

intent on communicating its policy intentions as clearly as possible in order to reduce the 

likelihood of future disruptions to markets.  We will continue to monitor investor 

behavior closely, both domestically and internationally.
