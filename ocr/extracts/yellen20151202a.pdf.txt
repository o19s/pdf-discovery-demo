Thank you to the Economic Club of Washington for inviting me to speak to you 

today.  I would like to offer my assessment of the U.S. economy, nearly six and half 

years after the beginning of the current economic expansion, and my view of the 

economic outlook.  I will describe the progress the economy has made toward the Federal 

Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) goals of maximum employment and stable prices 

and what the current situation and the outlook imply for how monetary policy is likely to 

evolve to best foster the attainment of those objectives.  

The Economic Outlook 

The U.S. economy has recovered substantially since the Great Recession.  The 

unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, declined to 5 percent in 

October of this year.  At that level, the unemployment rate is near the median of FOMC 

participants’ most recent estimates of its longer-run normal level.1  The economy has 

created about 13 million jobs since the low point for employment in early 2010, and total 

nonfarm payrolls are now almost 4-1/2 million higher than just prior to the recession.  

Most recently, after a couple months of relatively modest payroll growth, employers 

added an estimated 271,000 jobs in October.  This increase brought the average monthly 

gain since June to about 195,000--close to the monthly pace of around 210,000 in the first 

half of the year and still sufficient to be consistent with continued improvement in the 

labor market.   

Despite these substantial gains, we cannot yet, in my judgment, declare that the 

labor market has reached full employment.  Let me describe the basis for that view.

FOMC meeting.  See Board of Governors (2015b).

To begin with, I believe that a significant number of individuals now classified as 

out of the labor force would find and accept jobs in an even stronger labor market.  To be 

classified as unemployed, working-age people must report that they have actively sought 

work within the past four weeks.  Most of those not seeking work are appropriately not 

counted as unemployed.  These include most retirees, teenagers and young adults in 

school, and those staying home to care for children and other dependent family members.  

Even in a stronger job market, it is likely that many of these individuals would choose not 

to work.   

But some who are counted as out of the labor force might be induced to seek work 

if the likelihood of finding a job rose or if the expected pay was higher.  Examples here 

include people who had become too discouraged to search for work when the prospects 

for employment were poor and some who retired when their previous jobs ended.  In 

October, almost 2 million individuals classified as outside the labor force because they 

had not searched for work in the previous four weeks reported that they wanted and were 

available for work.  This is a considerable number of people, and some of them 

undoubtedly would be drawn back into the workforce as the labor market continued to 

strengthen.  Likewise, some of those who report they don’t want to work now could 

change their minds in a stronger job market.   

Another margin of labor market slack not reflected in the unemployment rate 

consists of individuals who report that they are working part time but would prefer a full-

time job and cannot find one--those classified as “part time for economic reasons.”  The 

share of such workers jumped from 3 percent of total employment prior to the Great 

Recession to around 6-1/2 percent by 2010.  Since then, however, the share of these part 


 - 3 - 

time workers has fallen considerably and now is less than 4 percent of those employed.  

While this decline represents considerable progress, particularly given secular trends that 

over time may have increased the prevalence of part-time employment, I think some 

room remains for the hours of these workers to increase as the labor market improves 

further.   

The pace of increases in labor compensation provides another possible indicator, 

albeit an imperfect one, of the degree of labor market slack.  Until recently labor 

compensation had grown only modestly, at average annual rates of around 2 to 2-1/2 

percent.  More recently, however, we have seen a welcome pickup in the growth rate of 

average hourly earnings for all employees and of compensation per hour in the business 

sector.  While it is too soon to conclude whether these more rapid rates of increase will 

continue, a sustained pickup would likely signal a diminution of labor market slack.   

Turning to overall economic activity, U.S. economic output--as measured by 

inflation-adjusted gross domestic product (GDP), or real GDP--has increased at a 

moderate pace, on balance, during the expansion.  Over the first three quarters of this 

year, real GDP is currently estimated to have advanced at an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent, 

close to its average pace over the previous five years.  Many economic forecasters expect 

growth roughly along those same lines in the fourth quarter.   

Growth this year has been held down by weak net exports, which have subtracted 

more than 1/2 percentage point, on average, from the annual rate of real GDP growth 

over the past three quarters.  Foreign economic growth has slowed, damping increases in 

U.S. exports, and the U.S. dollar has appreciated substantially since the middle of last 

year, making our exports more expensive and imported goods cheaper.   


 - 4 - 

By contrast, total real private domestic final purchases (PDFP)--which includes 

household spending, business fixed investment, and residential investment, and currently 

represents about 85 percent of aggregate spending--has increased at an annual rate of 

3 percent this year, significantly faster than real GDP.  Household spending growth has 

been particularly solid in 2015, with purchases of new motor vehicles especially strong.  

Job growth has bolstered household income, and lower energy prices have left consumers 

with more to spend on other goods and services.  These same factors likely have 

contributed to consumer confidence that is more upbeat this year than last year.  Increases 

in home values and stock market prices in recent years, along with reductions in debt, 

have pushed up the net worth of households, which also supports consumer spending.  

Finally, interest rates for borrowers remain low, due in part to the FOMC’s 

accommodative monetary policy, and these low rates appear to have been especially 

relevant for consumers considering the purchase of durable goods.2 

Other components of PDFP, including residential and business investment, have 

also advanced this year.  The same factors supporting consumer spending have supported 

further gains in the housing sector.  Indeed, gains in real residential investment spending 

have been faster so far in 2015 than last year, although the level of new residential 

construction still remains fairly low.  And outside of the drilling and mining sector, where 

lower oil prices have led to substantial cuts in outlays for new structures, business 

investment spending has posted moderate gains. 

 On balance, the moderate average pace of real GDP growth so far this year and 

over the entire expansion has been sufficient to help move the labor market closer to the

FOMC’s goal of maximum employment.  However, less progress has been made on the 

second leg of our dual mandate--price stability--as inflation continues to run below the 

FOMC’s longer-run objective of 2 percent.  Overall consumer price inflation--as 

measured by the change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures--was 

only 1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October.  However, this number largely 

reflects the sharp fall in crude oil prices since the summer of 2014 that, in turn, has 

pushed down retail prices for gasoline and other consumer energy products.  Because 

food and energy prices are volatile, it is often helpful to look at inflation excluding those 

two categories--known as core inflation--which is typically a better indicator of future 

overall inflation than recent readings of headline inflation.  But core inflation--which ran 

at 1-1/4 percent over the 12 months ending in October--is also well below our 2 percent 

objective, partly reflecting the appreciation of the U.S. dollar.  The stronger dollar has 

pushed down the prices of imported goods, placing temporary downward pressure on 

core inflation.3  The plunge in crude oil prices may also have had some small indirect 

effects in holding down the prices of non-energy items in core inflation, as producers 

passed on to their customers some of the reductions in their energy-related costs.  Taking 

account of these effects, which may be holding down core inflation by around 1/4 to 

1/2 percentage point, it appears that the underlying rate of inflation in the United States 

has been running in the vicinity of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.   

Let me now turn to where I see the economy is likely headed over the next several 

years.  To summarize, I anticipate continued economic growth at a moderate pace that 

will be sufficient to generate additional increases in employment, further reductions in

the remaining margins of labor market slack, and a rise in inflation to our 2 percent 

objective.  I expect that the fundamental factors supporting domestic spending that I have 

enumerated today will continue to do so, while the drag from some of the factors that 

have been weighing on economic growth should begin to lessen next year.  Although the 

economic outlook, as always, is uncertain, I currently see the risks to the outlook for 

economic activity and the labor market as very close to balanced. 

Turning to the factors that have been holding down growth, as I already noted, the 

higher foreign exchange value of the dollar, as well as weak growth in some foreign 

economies, has restrained the demand for U.S. exports over the past year.  In addition, 

lower crude oil prices have reduced activity in the domestic oil sector.  I anticipate that 

the drag on U.S. economic growth from these factors will diminish in the next couple of 

years as the global economy improves and the adjustment to prior declines in oil prices is 

completed.   

Although developments in foreign economies still pose risks to U.S. economic 

growth that we are monitoring, these downside risks from abroad have lessened since late 

summer.  Among emerging market economies, recent data support the view that the 

slowdown in the Chinese economy, which has received considerable attention, will likely 

continue to be modest and gradual.  China has taken actions to stimulate its economy this 

year and could do more if necessary.  A number of other emerging market economies 

have eased monetary and fiscal policy this year, and economic activity in these 

economies has improved of late.  Accommodative monetary policy is also supporting 

economic growth in the advanced economies.  A pickup in demand in many advanced 


 - 7 - 

economies and a stabilization in commodity prices should, in turn, boost the growth 

prospects of emerging market economies.   

A final positive development for the outlook that I will mention relates to fiscal 

policy.  This year the effect of federal fiscal policy on real GDP growth has been roughly 

neutral, in contrast to earlier years in which the expiration of stimulus programs and 

fiscal policy actions to reduce the federal budget deficit created significant drags on 

growth.4  Also, the budget situation for many state and local governments has improved 

as the economic expansion has increased the revenues of these governments, allowing 

them to increase their hiring and spending after a number of years of cuts in the wake of 

the Great Recession.  Looking ahead, I anticipate that total real government purchases of 

goods and services should have a modest positive effect on economic growth over the 

next few years.5   

Regarding U.S. inflation, I anticipate that the drag from the large declines in 

prices for crude oil and imports over the past year and a half will diminish next year.  

With less downward pressure on inflation from these factors and some upward pressure 

from a further tightening in U.S. labor and product markets, I expect inflation to move up 

to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective over the next few years.  Of course, inflation 

expectations play an important role in the inflation process, and my forecast of a return to 

our 2 percent objective over the medium term relies on a judgment that longer-term 

inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored.  In this regard, recent measures 

                                                   
4 The Congressional Budget Office estimates that current federal fiscal policies will have little effect on 
economic growth this year, but that earlier fiscal policy actions reduced the rate of real GDP growth 
roughly 1-1/2 percentage points in 2013 and about 1/4 percentage point in 2014 relative to what it would 
have been otherwise.  See Congressional Budget Office (2015a).

from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, and the 

Survey of Primary Dealers have continued to be generally stable.  The measure of longer-

term inflation expectations from the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, in 

contrast, has lately edged below its typical range in recent years.  However, this measure 

often seems to respond modestly, though temporarily, to large changes in actual inflation, 

and the very low readings on headline inflation over the past year may help explain some 

of the recent decline in the Michigan measure.6  Market-based measures of inflation 

compensation have moved up some in recent weeks after declining to historically low 

levels earlier in the fall.  While the low level of these measures appears to reflect, at least 

in part, changes in risk and liquidity premiums, we will continue to monitor this 

development closely.  Convincing evidence that longer-term inflation expectations have 

moved lower would be a concern because declines in consumer and business expectations 

about inflation could put downward pressure on actual inflation, making the attainment of 

our 2 percent inflation goal more difficult.   

Monetary Policy 

Let me now turn to the implications of the economic outlook for monetary policy.  

Reflecting progress toward the Committee’s objectives, many FOMC participants 

indicated in September that they anticipated, in light of their economic forecasts at the 

time, that it would be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate by the 

end of this year.  Some participants projected that it would be appropriate to wait until 

later to raise the target funds rate range, but all agreed that the timing of a rate increase 

                                                   
6 For example, the University of Michigan survey measure of longer-term inflation expectations was 
temporarily elevated relative to its usual range in 2008 when crude oil and other commodity prices spiked 
and pushed up actual headline inflation for a time.

would depend on what the incoming data tell us about the economic outlook and the 

associated risks to that outlook.   

In the policy statement issued after its October meeting, the FOMC reaffirmed its 

judgment that it would be appropriate to increase the target range for the federal funds 

rate when we had seen some further improvement in the labor market and were 

reasonably confident that inflation would move back to the Committee’s 2 percent 

objective over the medium term.  That initial rate increase would reflect the Committee’s 

judgment, based on a range of indicators, that the economy would continue to grow at a 

pace sufficient to generate further labor market improvement and a return of inflation to 

2 percent, even after the reduction in policy accommodation.  As I have already noted, I 

currently judge that U.S. economic growth is likely to be sufficient over the next year or 

two to result in further improvement in the labor market.  Ongoing gains in the labor 

market, coupled with my judgment that longer-term inflation expectations remain 

reasonably well anchored, serve to bolster my confidence in a return of inflation to 

2 percent as the disinflationary effects of declines in energy and import prices wane. 

Committee participants recognize that the future course of the economy is 

uncertain, and we take account of both the upside and downside risks around our 

projections when judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy.  In particular, recent 

monetary policy decisions have reflected our recognition that, with the federal funds rate 

near zero, we can respond more readily to upside surprises to inflation, economic growth, 

and employment than to downside shocks.  This asymmetry suggests that it is appropriate 

to be more cautious in raising our target for the federal funds rate than would be the case 


 - 10 - 

if short-term nominal interest rates were appreciably above zero.7  Reflecting these 

concerns, we have maintained our current policy stance even as the labor market has 

improved appreciably.   

However, we must also take into account the well-documented lags in the effects 

of monetary policy.8  Were the FOMC to delay the start of policy normalization for too 

long, we would likely end up having to tighten policy relatively abruptly to keep the 

economy from significantly overshooting both of our goals.  Such an abrupt tightening 

would risk disrupting financial markets and perhaps even inadvertently push the economy 

into recession.  Moreover, holding the federal funds rate at its current level for too long 

could also encourage excessive risk-taking and thus undermine financial stability.   

On balance, economic and financial information received since our October 

meeting has been consistent with our expectations of continued improvement in the labor 

market.  And, as I have noted, continuing improvement in the labor market helps 

strengthen confidence that inflation will move back to our 2 percent objective over the 

medium term.  That said, between today and the next FOMC meeting, we will receive 

additional data that bear on the economic outlook.  These data include a range of 

indicators regarding the labor market, inflation, and economic activity.  When my 

colleagues and I meet, we will assess all of the available data and their implications for 

the economic outlook in making our policy decision.   

                                                   
7 See, for example, Adam and Billi (2007), Nakata (2012), and Evans and others (2015).  
8 Milton Friedman famously concluded that “monetary actions affect economic conditions only after a lag 
that is both long and variable” (1961, p. 447).  Evidence that monetary policy affects inflation with a lag 
comes in part from vector autoregressions in which monetary policy shocks have been identified under a 
variety of identification assumptions.  See, for example, Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005) and 
Uhlig (2005).  


 - 11 - 

As you know, there has been considerable focus on the first increase in the federal 

funds rate after nearly seven years in which that rate has been at its effective lower 

bound.  We have tried to be as clear as possible about the considerations that will affect 

that decision.  Of course, even after the initial increase in the federal funds rate, monetary 

policy will remain accommodative.  And it bears emphasizing that what matters for the 

economic outlook are the public’s expectations concerning the path of the federal funds 

rate over time:  It is those expectations that affect financial conditions and thereby 

influence spending and investment decisions.  In this regard, the Committee anticipates 

that even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic 

conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels 

the Committee views as normal in the longer run.   

This expectation is consistent with an implicit assessment that the neutral nominal 

federal funds rate--defined as the value of the federal funds rate that would be neither 

expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its potential--is 

currently low by historical standards and is likely to rise only gradually over time.  One 

indication that the neutral funds rate is unusually low is that U.S. economic growth has 

been quite modest in recent years despite the very low level of the federal funds rate and 

the Federal Reserve’s very large holdings of longer-term securities.  Had the neutral rate 

been running closer to the levels that are thought to have prevailed prior to the financial 

crisis, current monetary policy settings would have been expected to foster a very rapid 

economic expansion, with inflation likely rising significantly above our 2 percent 

objective. 


 - 12 - 

Empirical support for the judgment that the neutral federal funds rate is low 

comes from both academic research and Federal Reserve staff analysis.  Figure 1 

employs four macroeconomic models used by Federal Reserve staff to estimate the 

“natural” real rate of interest, a concept closely related to the neutral rate.9  The measures 

of the natural rate shown in this figure represent the real short-term interest rate that 

would prevail in the absence of frictions that slow the adjustment of wages and prices to 

changes in the economy; under a variety of assumptions, this interest rate has been shown 

to promote full employment.10  The shaded blue band represents the range of the 

estimates of the natural real rate at each point in time.  This analysis suggests that the 

natural real rate fell sharply with the onset of the crisis and has recovered only partially.  

These findings are broadly consistent with those reported in a paper by Thomas Laubach 

and John Williams, shown in figure 2.11   

                                                   
9 Note that these estimates are in real terms; to obtain estimates of the nominal natural interest rate, one 
would add a measure of expected inflation.  The four models used are (1) a dynamic stochastic general 
equilibrium (DSGE) model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board and described in Kiley 
(2013); (2) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and described 
in Del Negro and others (2013); (3) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the Federal Reserve Board 
based on Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2014); and (4) a DSGE model developed by the staff of the 
Federal Reserve Board based on Guerrieri and Iacoviello (2013 [rev. 2014]). 
10 The concept of the natural rate goes back to Wicksell, who defined it as the rate that “tends neither to 
raise nor to lower” (1936 [1898], p. 102) commodity prices.  Wicksell posited that the natural rate would be 
equal to the real interest rate that would balance supply and demand absent monetary frictions.  The recent 
academic literature draws on this notion to define the natural rate as the real interest rate that would prevail 
in the absence of sluggish adjustment in nominal prices and wages.  In simple models, this interest rate 
would result in stable prices and full employment; in some more complex models, this interest rate has 
been found to promote stable inflation and appropriate economic activity, although monetary policymakers 
face important tradeoffs in such settings.  Importantly, the natural rate varies over time.  For example, it 
generally rises with expected productivity growth and with “preference shocks” that capture households’ 
desire to consume today rather than save.  For further discussion of the potential usefulness of the natural 
rate for monetary policy, see, for example, Barsky, Justiniano, and Melosi (2014) and Cúrdia and others 
(2015).  By contrast, Laubach and Williams (2015) employ a statistical approach that defines the natural 
rate as one consistent with the economy operating at its full potential once transitory shocks to aggregate 
supply and demand have abated.  These two approaches to the measurement of the natural real rate are 
different but have important similarities.  Qualitatively, the two measures would be expected to move 
together in response to shocks to productivity growth and preferences so long as those shocks were very 
persistent.   
11 See Laubach and Williams (2015). 


 - 13 - 

The marked decline in the neutral federal funds rate after the crisis may be 

partially attributable to a range of persistent economic headwinds that have weighed on 

aggregate demand.  These headwinds have included tighter underwriting standards and 

limited access to credit for some borrowers, deleveraging by many households to reduce 

debt burdens, contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government, weak growth 

abroad coupled with a significant appreciation of the dollar, slower productivity and labor 

force growth, and elevated uncertainty about the economic outlook.12  As the restraint 

from these headwinds further abates, I anticipate that the neutral federal funds rate will 

gradually move higher over time.  Indeed, in September, most FOMC participants 

projected that, in the long run, the nominal federal funds rate would be near 3.5 percent, 

and that the actual federal funds rate would rise to that level fairly slowly.13   

Because the value of the neutral federal funds rate is not directly measureable and 

must be estimated based on our imperfect understanding of the economy and the 

available data, I would stress that considerable uncertainty attends our estimates of its 

current level and even more to its likely path going forward.14  That said, we will learn 

                                                   
12 For analyses of how a sudden tightening in access to credit can lead to household deleveraging, pushing 
down the neutral rate of interest, see Eggertsson and Krugman (2012) and Guerrieri and Lorenzoni (2015). 
13 See figure 2 in the Summary of Economic Projections, an addendum to the minutes of the September 
2015 FOMC meeting.  See Board of Governors (2015b).  The longer-run normal level of the federal funds 
rate reported in the SEP presumably matches participants’ assessment of the neutral nominal federal funds 
rate that will prevail in the longer run.  Between June 2012 and September 2015 the median of FOMC 
participants’ estimates of the longer-run level of the federal funds rate declined 75 basis points, to 3.5 
percent.  When revising down their estimates of the longer-run federal funds rate, participants have 
generally cited a lower assessment of the economy’s longer-run potential growth rate as a contributing 
factor. 
14 One source of uncertainty regarding the neutral federal funds rate is so-called model uncertainty.  As 
shown in figure 1, a variety of models that provide plausible descriptions of the economy give somewhat 
different estimates of the neutral rate.  A second source of uncertainty is the limited sample size of relevant 
macroeconomic data:  Our estimates of the neutral federal funds rate represent inferences about a moving 
target.  As a result, although the data provide important signals about the neutral rate, our estimates are 
necessarily imprecise.  In Laubach and Williams (2003), for example, the standard error of the estimate of 
the neutral rate in one baseline model was about 2 percentage points on average.  Moreover, one-sided

more from observing economic developments in the period ahead.  It is thereby important 

to emphasize that the actual path of monetary policy will depend on how incoming data 

affect the evolution of the economic outlook.  Stronger growth or a more rapid increase in 

inflation than we currently anticipate would suggest that the neutral federal funds rate is 

rising more quickly than expected, making it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate 

more quickly as well; conversely, if the economy disappoints, the federal funds rate 

would likely rise more slowly.  Given the persistent shortfall in inflation from our 

2 percent objective, the Committee will, of course, carefully monitor actual progress 

toward our inflation goal as we make decisions over time on the appropriate path for the 

federal funds rate. 

In closing, let me again thank the Economic Club of Washington for this 

opportunity to speak about the economy and monetary policy.  The economy has come a 

long way toward the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  

When the Committee begins to normalize the stance of policy, doing so will be a 

testament, also, to how far our economy has come in recovering from the effects of the 

financial crisis and the Great Recession.  In that sense, it is a day that I expect we all are 

looking forward to. 


                                                   
estimates of the neutral rate--those available to policymakers, based only on data known at the time--are 
generally noisier than estimates of the neutral rate at some previous time that incorporate all the data 
available.
