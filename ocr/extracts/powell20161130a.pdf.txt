Thanks to David Wessel and the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy 

at the Brookings Institution for putting together this event.1  Today I will share my own 

views on the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) public communications, which 

are designed to serve three important purposes.  The first is to provide the transparency 

that enables the Congress and the public to hold the Committee accountable for its 

decisions on monetary policy.  The second is to enhance the effectiveness of monetary 

policy.  If the public understands the central bank’s views on the economy and monetary 

policy, then households and businesses will take those views into account in making their 

spending and investment plans; policy will be more effective as a result.  And the third is 

to show the full range of FOMC participants’ views, even if doing so may sometimes 

make it difficult for the public to identify a consensus view.  In my view, 

acknowledgment of this diversity of views is important in sustaining the public’s support 

over time for the Federal Reserve as an institution--what Jon Faust refers to in his paper 

as our “democratic legitimacy.”2  In my comments, I will also react to Jon’s thought-

provoking and well-reasoned paper. 

The Modern Era 

I will start with a brief tour of the modern era of FOMC communications, 

beginning with the issuance of the first postmeeting statement in February 1994.3  That 

                                                 
1 The views I express here are my own.

Times,” paper prepared for “Understanding Fedspeak,” an event cosponsored by the Hutchins Center on 
Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution and the Center for Financial Economics at Johns 
Hopkins University, held at the Brookings Institution, Washington, November 30.

statement contained four sentences and noted that the policy action was being announced 

immediately “so as to avoid any misunderstanding of the Committee’s purposes.”4  The 

Committee took additional steps to enhance transparency over the next two decades by 

putting its target for the federal funds rate into the statement (July 1995); releasing 

statements after every meeting rather than only after meetings at which the Committee 

had changed its policy (May 1999); including voting information along with an 

explanation of dissents in the statement (March 2002); adding the first explicit forward-

guidance language to the statement--the “considerable period” language (August 2003); 

and accelerating the release of the minutes after an FOMC meeting (December 2004).5 

The pace of change accelerated notably after Ben Bernanke became Chairman in 

2006.  At that time, the Fed was said to be a bit of a communications laggard compared 

with some other central banks.  Chairman Bernanke’s agenda would move the FOMC to 

the forefront of transparency and accountability in modern central banking. 

In October 2007, after extensive discussions and internal trial runs, the FOMC 

published its first Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), which built on the 

macroeconomic forecasts from the semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.  

Since then, SEP projections have been expanded to include longer-run values for real 

gross domestic product growth, the unemployment rate, headline PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) price inflation, and the federal funds rate; assessments of

minutes between two and five weeks.  See Deborah J. Danker and Matthew M. Luecke (2005),

uncertainty and risks to the economic outlook; and, of course, the federal funds rate 

projections, or “dot plot,” added in January 2012.6  An extensive write-up of the 

projections is included as an addendum to the meeting minutes.  Finally, and perhaps 

most important, since April 2011, the Chair has held a quarterly press conference 

following the FOMC meetings at which SEP projections are collected. 

In January 2012, the Committee first released its Statement on Longer-Run Goals 

and Monetary Policy Strategy, which is reaffirmed annually.  This consensus statement 

serves as a quasi-constitutional document that clarifies that the Committee’s inflation 

objective is 2 percent as measured by the annual change in the PCE price index, that this 

objective is symmetric, that the maximum level of employment is largely determined by 

nonmonetary factors affecting the structure and dynamics of the labor market, and that 

the Committee will take a balanced approach to promote its objectives of maximum 

employment and 2 percent inflation under circumstances in which the Committee judges 

that those objectives are not complementary. 

Compared with a decade ago, FOMC participants express their views more 

frequently through speeches and interviews, and our communications vehicles reveal a 

greater diversity of viewpoints.  In FOMC meetings, as readers of our transcripts know, 

FOMC participants now speak longer than they did before 2006, and they typically make 

their remarks prior to hearing the policy views of the Chair.  Since September 2010, the 

minutes have included paragraphs that reflect the views on monetary policy expressed by 

all meeting participants, not just those who vote on the policy decision.  These changes,

policy as defined by the value of the federal funds rate target or the midpoint of the federal funds rate target

taken together with the SEP and the dot plot, have given greater emphasis to the diversity 

of views of Fed policymakers. 

Discussion 

The large size and unique structure of the FOMC have important implications for 

our communications.  The Committee has seats for up to 19 participants, up to 12 of 

whom hold votes at any given time.  Governors are appointed by the President and 

confirmed by the Senate.  Reserve Bank Presidents are appointed by the Banks’ private-

sector board members who are not affiliated with commercial banks, subject to approval 

by the Board of Governors.  This unique federated structure was designed to ensure a 

diversity of views, among other purposes.  My strong view is that this institutionalized 

diversity of thinking is a strength of our System.  My own experience is that the best 

outcomes are reached when opposing viewpoints are clearly and strongly presented 

before decisions are made.  The Committee’s diversity shows through most clearly at 

times such as these, when economic conditions have been particularly challenging and 

when there have been significant policy disagreements. 

Our communications are intended to enable the public to better understand how 

the Committee sees the economic situation and outlook, as well as what the Committee is 

likely to do if incoming data differ from that outlook--the Committee’s “reaction 

function.”  My sense is that market participants and other members of the public focus 

instead mainly on the timing of the next policy change or on how many policy moves will 

occur in a given year.  It also seems that the public may not fully appreciate the 

uncertainty that surrounds the outlook.  In addition, market participants often say that 

there are too many voices saying too many different things about policy--the cacophony

problem.  The dot plot has been a poor predictor of the Committee’s actual policy path, 

and some have questioned its usefulness.  However, markets do not appear to be 

unusually uncertain about FOMC decisions.7 

In theory, our communications about monetary policy can be roughly divided into 

those that express the consensus and those that show the diversity of views.  Today I will 

focus on the latter.  Specifically, are communications that illustrate the diversity of views 

about the likely policy path--particularly the dot plot and public commentary by FOMC 

participants other than the Chair--currently serving us well?  And if not, how can we 

make improvements? 

Questions of how much to say about the likely path of policy were extensively 

debated in the public sphere in the years leading up to the Bernanke era, and by the 

FOMC while Ben was Chairman.8  The benefits of greater transparency are typically 

thought to include more efficient pricing of financial assets and a closer alignment 

between the market’s views and those of the Committee.9  Transparency should allow 

asset prices to respond immediately to incoming economic data, which would foster 

progress toward the Committee’s objectives.  Those who supported the publication of 

some form of policy rate path generally saw it as part of a forecast-based approach to 

policymaking, in which policy plans depend in a complex way on policymakers’

outlooks, risk assessments, and objectives.10  The whole forward interest rate curve 

matters for financial conditions, not just the overnight rate.  Monetary policy was 

therefore thought to be made more effective by communication of the full expected path 

of policy, which could then be incorporated into private-sector expectations and longer-

term interest rates.  But all along, there have been other voices urging caution and asking, 

in effect, “How much transparency is too much?”  As Don Kohn noted in 2005 remarks, 

“more is not necessarily always better” when it comes to Fed communication.11  Critics 

have often argued that too much discussion of the likely path of policy could be taken as 

a commitment to a particular path and timing and could ultimately constrain the 

Committee from pursuing what it views to be the optimal path.  Indeed, to the extent that 

the Committee’s talk about the path of policy is given weight, that talk may leave “too 

little scope for private assessments of economic developments to show through” in 

market prices.12 

Jon notes in his paper that communications about monetary policy generally 

received high marks from 2008 through early 2013, and he focuses his analysis on the 

challenging period since mid-2013.  I am also going to skip over the years 2013-14, 

which included the “taper tantrum” and the relatively uneventful taper itself.  I will focus 

instead on the years 2015-16, which seem to me to be the most relevant to the challenges

the Committee faces today.  I will pay particular attention to the dot plot, the cacophony 

issue, and the need to do a better job of explaining uncertainty. 

The Dot Plot 

The dot plot is not a consensus forecast of the Committee.  Rather, the dots 

represent each individual participant’s assessment of the appropriate policy path.  The 

Committee considered the use of a consensus forecast in 2012 but abandoned the effort 

after struggling to reach agreement on its parameters.13 

As you can see from figure 1, the median dots have moved down from SEP to 

SEP.  The December 2014 SEP median dots showed increases of 350 basis points over 

the years 2015-2017.  In the event, there was one 25 basis point rate increase in 2015, and 

the September 2016 SEP median shows one more in 2016 and two in 2017--for a total of 

100 basis points.  Figures 2 and 3 display rate expectations derived from financial market 

prices and forecasts made by financial market participants, respectively.  These market 

paths have also declined significantly over the period.  And the path estimated from 

overnight index swaps (figure 2) has been substantially below the SEP median.  It does 

not appear that markets have uncritically accepted the dots, let alone taken them as a 

commitment.14 

                                                 
13 According to the minutes from the October 22-23, 2012, FOMC meeting, “In their discussion, 
participants agreed that FOMC communications could be enhanced by clarifying the linkage between 
participants’ economic forecasts, including the underlying policy assumptions, and the Committee’s policy 
decision as expressed in the postmeeting statement.  However, most participants judged that, given the 
diversity of their views about the economy’s structure and dynamics, it would be difficult for the 
Committee to agree on a fully specified longer-term path for monetary policy to incorporate into a 
quantitative consensus forecast in a timely manner, especially under present conditions in which the policy 
decision comprises several elements.”  See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2012), 
“Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, October 23-24, 2012,” press release, November 14, 
paragraph 52, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20121114a.htm. 
14 The expected policy rate paths shown in figures 1, 2, and 3 are not entirely comparable.  The SEP paths 
are median values of the modal projections of individual participants for the end of the calendar year.  The

Some argue that the downward march of the dots has damaged the Committee’s 

credibility.  For me, the story is both more complicated and more interesting.  Like Jon, I 

do not think of the dot plot as a useful predictor of near-term policy moves.  But that is 

not to say that the dot plot is without value.  Indeed, changes in the SEP and the dot plot 

over time have been quite revealing about the evolution of policymakers’ views about the 

path of policy. 

In recent years, FOMC participants have significantly revised their views about 

the values to which key economic variables will converge over the longer run.  The same 

is true of many other economic forecasters.  Since the beginning of 2012, participants’ 

views about the longer-run annual growth potential of the economy have dropped from 

2.45 percent to 1.85 percent (figure 4).15  Much of the downward revision in estimates of 

longer-run potential growth reflects the implications of demographic trends and the 

slowdown in productivity growth.16  These structural factors have also weighed on 

participants’ assessments of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate--the rate that would 

be neither expansionary nor contractionary if the economy were operating near its 

                                                 
overnight index swap (OIS) paths are estimated using a spline approach; each line corresponds to the 
estimated path on the day before the release of SEP projections.  OIS paths are mean forecasts of market 
participants and may be influenced by variations in risk premiums over time.  The primary dealer survey 
paths are medians of modal forecasts, and the survey responses are collected about a week before the SEP 
projections are released. 
15 Other forecasters--for instance, Blue Chip and the Survey of Professional Forecasters--have also revised 
down their estimates for longer-run real gross domestic product (GDP) growth.  See Jerome H. Powell 
(2016), “Recent Economic Developments, the Productive Potential of the Economy, and Monetary Policy,” 
speech delivered at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington, May 26, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20160526a.htm.  In making these comparisons, I 
use the midpoint of the central tendency for real GDP growth and the unemployment rate.

potential.17  The median assessment of the longer-run neutral federal funds rate declined 

from 4.25 percent in 2012 to 2.90 percent in September of this year, with 60 basis points 

of that shift occurring just since September 2015 (figure 5).  The persistence of low 

inflation despite faster-than-expected reductions in unemployment has also led 

participants to lower their estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate; the 

median estimate has declined from 5.60 percent in January 2012 to 4.85 percent in 

September 2016 (figure 6). 

Taken together, these revisions explain a good part of the downward movement of 

the dots.  One way to see that is through the application of a policy rule, such as a Taylor 

rule.18  Simple policy rules, as they are sometimes called, incorporate key factors for 

monetary policy, including the natural rate of unemployment, the neutral rate of interest, 

and deviations of inflation and unemployment from their long-run values.  As they 

prepare for FOMC meetings, FOMC participants routinely see policy recommendations 

from a variety of rules, including several Taylor rule variations.  While these rules are 

useful as benchmarks, in my view they should not be excessively relied on for policy 

decisions.19

19 For example, FRB/US simulations using the Taylor (1993) rule for the period 2010-15 show 
substantially higher unemployment and lower inflation than was actually realized.  For more information 
about the Taylor (1993) rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion versus Policy Rules in Practice,”

The red solid line in figure 7 shows the policy prescription using the original 1993 

Taylor rule together with the September SEP dots for the federal funds rate.20  The 

Taylor rule prescription has been derived using the median value for core PCE price 

inflation, the unemployment rate, and the longer-run normal unemployment rate from the 

September 2016 SEP. 

The intercept in this Taylor rule represents the longer-run real interest rate--or r*--

which is set to 2 percent.  If we replace that intercept with the median of the longer-run r* 

implied by the most recent SEP, which is 0.9 percent, we see that the rule prescribes 

much lower settings for policy interest rates than the unadjusted rule (the blue dashed line 

in figure 7).  The lower intercept does not completely close the gap between the Taylor 

rule prescription and the dots.  However, many observers believe that the neutral real 

interest rate is currently well below its longer-run value.  The language that has appeared 

in the Committee’s postmeeting statement since December 2015 that “the federal funds 

rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the 

longer run” is consistent with this view.21 

We can estimate a short-run, time-varying r* using a standard reduced-form IS 

(investment and saving) equation that relates the unemployment gap to its own lagged 

value and the lagged real interest rate gap.  We use the median of FOMC participants’ 

                                                 
20 The SEP policy projections are for the midpoint of the federal funds rate target range at the end of a 
calendar year.  The Taylor (1993) rule is defined as Rt = 2 + πt + 0.5(πt – 2) + 0.5Yt.  In this expression, R 
is the federal funds rate, π is the percent change in the core PCE price index from four quarters earlier, and 
Y is the output gap.  The rule used here is in terms of the unemployment gap instead of the output gap.  The 
output gap is approximated using Okun’s law; specifically, Yt = 2.0(U* – Ut), where U is the 
unemployment rate and U* is the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or NAIRU.

projections from the September SEP in this exercise.  The IS specification employed here 

is similar to that used in Laubach-Williams (2003) and is shown in figure 8.22  Using 

these short-run, time-varying estimates of r* as intercepts in our Taylor rule gives us the 

purple dashed-dotted line in figure 9.  This rule now tells us that the median dot remains 

slightly below the adjusted rule’s prescription at the end of 2016 and 2017 but is back in 

line by the end of 2018. 

As Don Kohn recently noted, “We have been in uncharted waters with unreliable 

anchors.”23  The downward march of the dots shows that policymakers have been 

learning, and our understanding of the economy has been evolving, as we navigate the 

treacherous shoals of the post-crisis economy.  The revisions in the longer-run values and 

the short-run, time-varying r* estimates provide a framework for understanding 

policymakers’ evolving views of the economy and of appropriate monetary policy.  And 

the dots for 2016 and 2017 lie below the purple dashed-dotted line in figure 9, showing 

that FOMC participants see an even more gradual path of rate increases than suggested 

by the short-run r* estimates.  This lower path may be related to global economic 

weakness and risk-management considerations at the effective lower bound.  Of course, 

all of this would have happened in the absence of an SEP or a dot plot.  The new

communications tools have made the process more transparent to the public.  In this 

sense, the dot plot is more messenger than message. 

Cacophony 

I often hear that there are too many voices offering too much diversity of views 

about the likely path of policy—the cacophony problem.  Reserve Bank Presidents and 

Governors are expected to publicly discuss their views on the economy and policy.  

Indeed, our policy on the external communications of FOMC participants states that “the 

Committee’s public accountability is strengthened by open discussion of Committee 

participants’ views about the economic outlook as well as their judgments about the 

appropriate course of monetary policy.”24  Central banking often comes across as obscure 

and complicated, and we try to help the public understand what we do.  But there is more 

to it than that.  Jon Faust’s paper captures well the framers’ vision of an institutionalized 

diversity of perspectives.  In my view, the public expression of our diverse views helps 

sustain public support for the Federal Reserve as a public institution.  Those members of 

the public who disagree with our policy should know that their concerns are given voice 

in our deliberations.  But there is a tradeoff here that needs to be managed:  On the one 

hand, the effectiveness of policy is thought to depend on the public’s understanding of 

the Committee’s consensus.  On the other hand, the expression of diverse views may 

sometimes make it difficult for the public to see that consensus. 

Jon sees this public discussion about policy as mainly a form of negotiation.  In 

my view, motivations are simpler and more obvious.  Many of us enjoy getting out of the

office to speak to outside groups.  We appear to enjoy talking to print journalists, and 

some of us like going on television.  With the proliferation of media of all kinds, there is 

a need for content, and we have been willing suppliers.  In my view, these public 

appearances are mostly not about gaining leverage in a negotiation.  There is a single 

FOMC participant who has most of the leverage in our policy discussions.  Observers 

would be well advised to listen carefully to what she says. 

I strongly agree with Jon that it is wise not to read too much about the path of 

policy into all of this communication.  FOMC participants other than the Chair speak 

only for themselves and customarily make that clear at the beginning of their remarks. 

Their commentary is not intended to express the consensus or to predict its evolution. 

As Jon notes, during the Greenspan era, there was very little discussion of the 

likely path for the policy rate by FOMC participants, including the Chairman.  The 

proliferation of forward policy guidance during the crisis utterly broke that equilibrium.  

Many of us seem to be trained to a new habit, which is to offer one’s views about the 

near-term path for policy, typically at the end of a speech on the outlook.  While such 

communication can serve a useful purpose, I have come around to the view that focusing 

too much on the precise timing of policy moves may be adding to confusion and 

frustration about our communications.  I am trying to avoid this problem in my own 

remarks. 

Uncertainty 

All economic forecasts are subject to considerable uncertainty.  There is always a 

wide range of plausible outcomes for important economic variables, including the federal 

funds rate.  In her remarks at Jackson Hole in August, Chair Yellen showed the median

path for the federal funds rate from the June SEP surrounded by a 70 percent confidence 

interval based on the historical accuracy of private and government forecasts.25  I 

reproduce that figure here (figure 10), updated for the September 2016 SEP.26  Note that 

the tan confidence interval in the figure is much wider than the disparity of views as 

represented by the central tendency of the projections (the black dashed lines).  This 

uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of our world, and it should probably feature more 

prominently in our communications. 

Conclusion 

To sum up, the FOMC and individual participants communicate a great deal these 

days--much more than in the past.  Some of those communications are designed to 

express the consensus, and some are designed to show the diversity of views.  In my 

view, communications should do more to emphasize the uncertainty that surrounds all 

economic forecasts, should downplay short-term tactical questions such as the timing of 

the next rate increase, and should focus the public’s attention instead on the 

considerations that go into making policy across the range of plausible paths for the 

economy. 

                                                 
25 The reason for the confidence interval is that the economy is frequently buffeted by shocks and thus 
rarely evolves as predicted.  See Janet L. Yellen (2016), “The Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Toolkit:  
Past, Present, and Future,” speech delivered at “Designing Resilient Monetary Policy Frameworks for the 
Future,” a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., 
August 26, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20160826a.htm. 
26 The confidence interval equals the median SEP path for the federal funds rate plus or minus average root 
mean squared prediction errors of the three-month Treasury bill rate (subject to a lower bound of 12.5 basis 
points), for horizons from zero to three years ahead, based on forecast errors made over the past 20 years.  
For general information on the methodology used to construct confidence intervals using historical 
forecasting errors, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2007), “Gauging the Uncertainty of the 
Economic Outlook from Historical Forecasting Errors,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2007-60 
(Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, November), available at
