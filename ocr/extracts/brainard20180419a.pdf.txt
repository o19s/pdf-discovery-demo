I am honored to be here today to participate in the Global Finance Forum.    

It is a good moment to take stock of the cyclical position of the economy and the health 

of the banking system.1  In many respects, where we are today is the mirror image of where we 

were just a decade ago.  The job market is strong, household balance sheets have improved, and 

business activity is solid.  Banks are doing well--credit growth is robust, profitability is strong, 

and capital and liquidity buffers have been fortified.  While this progress is heartening, we 

cannot afford to be complacent.  If we have learned anything from the past, it is that we must be 

especially vigilant about the health of our financial system in good times, when potential 

vulnerabilities may be building.  Safeguarding resilience through the cycle should be a critical 

consideration in our ongoing evaluation of the regulatory framework.  With that in mind, I will 

spend a few minutes describing current conditions and then outline our ongoing work to ensure 

the financial system’s buffers continue to sustain resilience over the cycle.  

Current Conditions 

 Cyclical conditions have been strengthening.  Our growth here at home has been 

bolstered by synchronized growth abroad as well as supportive financial conditions.  

Employment growth has been heartening, and we are seeing the strong labor market continue to 

draw prime age Americans back into the labor force from the sidelines.  Sizable fiscal stimulus is 

likely to reinforce cyclical pressures at a time of above-trend growth and tightening resource 

utilization.  There are few historical episodes of similar pro-cyclical fiscal stimulus to draw upon 

as we assess the outlook.  But in the few cases where resource utilization has been near the levels

we may soon be approaching, there have been heightened risks either of inflation, in earlier 

decades, or of financial imbalances more recently. 

Currently, inflation appears to be well-anchored to the upside around our 2 percent target, 

but there are some signs of financial imbalances.  Our scan of financial vulnerabilities suggests 

elevated risks in two areas:  asset valuations and business leverage.  First, asset valuations across 

a range of markets remain elevated relative to a variety of historical norms, even after taking into 

account recent market volatility.  Corporate bond yields remain low by historical comparison, 

and spreads of yields on junk bonds above those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities are 

near the lower end of their historical range.  Spreads on leveraged loans and securitized products 

backed by those loans remain narrow.  Prices of multifamily residential and industrial 

commercial real estate (CRE) have risen, while capitalization rates for these segments have 

reached historical lows.   

Second, business leverage outside the financial sector has risen to levels that are high 

relative to historical trends. In the nonfinancial business sector, the debt-to-income ratio has 

increased to near the upper end of its historical distribution, and net leverage at speculative-grade 

firms is especially elevated.  As we have seen in previous cycles, unexpected negative shocks to 

earnings in combination with increased interest rates could lead to rising levels of delinquencies 

among business borrowers and related stresses to some banks’ balance sheets. 

Safeguarding Resilience through the Cycle 

We continue to assess the overall vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system to be 

moderate by historical standards in great measure because post-crisis reforms have strengthened 

the regulatory and supervisory framework for the largest U.S. banking firms.  The crisis revealed 

a stark weakness in the capital and liquidity positions of many of our large banking organizations

that left many of them incapable of dealing with financial stress and necessitated unprecedented 

government intervention.  A primary focus of post-crisis financial reform has been strengthening 

capital and liquidity buffers at large banking institutions, which has bolstered the safety and 

soundness of these institutions and reduced systemic risk more broadly.   

In terms of liquidity, not only do our largest firms now have the right kind and amount of 

liquidity calibrated to their funding needs and to their likely run risk in stressed conditions, but 

they also are required to know where it is at all times and to ensure it is positioned or readily 

accessible where it is most likely to be needed in resolution.  Prior to the crisis, many of the 

largest firms did not even have a good handle on where their liquidity was positioned.  For 

example, our largest banking firms have increased their holdings of high quality liquid assets 

from 12 percent of assets in 2011 to 20 percent of assets in 2017, and they have reduced their 

reliance on short-term wholesale funding from 37 percent of liabilities in 2011 to 25 percent of 

liabilities in 2017.2  This, combined with critical reforms to money market funds and other vital 

short-term funding markets, have reduced the vulnerabilities in the financial system associated 

with liquidity mismatch and maturity transformation. 

In terms of capital, the quality of capital has improved with a particular focus on common 

equity, the most loss-absorbing form of capital.  The quantity of capital also has increased 

through higher minimum requirements and new capital conservation buffers that require banking 

firms to keep their capital levels well above the minimums in order to maintain full flexibility to 

allocate profits to capital distributions and employee bonus payments.  These buffers increase the 

ability of banking organizations to absorb losses and continue to lend to households and

businesses, including during times of stress. Indeed, the common equity capital to risk-weighted 

assets ratio of the bank holding companies participating in the Comprehensive Capital Analysis 

and Review has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12 percent in 

the fourth quarter of 2017.3 

We now regularly conduct comprehensive stress tests of the largest banking firms to help 

ensure that their capital distribution plans are consistent with their ability to lend and withstand 

severe macroeconomic and financial stress like that observed during the financial crisis.  One 

key benefit of our stress testing program is that it promotes a dynamic forward-looking 

assessment of a bank’s capital adequacy in the face of severe stress.  It is critical to maintain a 

dynamic capital regime that anticipates rapidly changing risks and business conditions.  Without 

such a dynamic focus, there is a risk that regulators and banking institutions end up spending too 

much time looking in the rear-view mirror and not enough time looking ahead for emerging 

risks.  The stress testing capital regime applied to Fannie and Freddie before the crisis offers a 

sobering reminder of the dangers of failing to update stress tests in the face of changing market 

practices and emerging risks. 

The Federal Reserve has also imposed risk-based and leverage capital surcharges on the 

most systemic banking firms to ensure they internalize the costs their failure would have on the 

financial system and to provide an incentive to reduce their systemic footprint.  We have recently 

released a proposal for comment to introduce a “stress capital buffer” or SCB that would

integrate the forward-looking stress test results into each institution’s ongoing capital 

requirements.   

Some observers contend that current capital requirements are too onerous and are 

choking off credit.  But the evidence suggests otherwise:  U.S. bank lending has been healthy 

over recent years and profits are strong.  By any measure, U.S. banks appear very competitive 

relative to their international peers.  In that regard, the current level of capital is a sign of 

strength.  While there is a natural tendency to question the value of capital buffers when times 

are good, the severe costs associated with not having enough capital to absorb losses become all 

too evident in a downturn.  By the time losses are rising, it is generally too late to start building 

buffers, which became all too clear with devastating consequences in some countries during the 

last crisis.   

I support efforts to identify improvements that make regulations less burdensome.  But it 

is vital to be prudent regarding any material changes to the core capital and liquidity framework, 

and not lose sight of the need to safeguard financial resilience through the cycle.  Prudence 

would argue for waiting until we have tested how the new framework performs through a full 

cycle before we make judgments about its performance.  At this point in the cycle, it is 

premature to revisit the calibration of core capital and liquidity requirements for the large 

banking institutions.4  

                                                            
4  Cost-benefit studies support capital requirements at current levels or higher.  See, for example, the review of 
evidence in Simon Firestone, Amy Lorenc, and Ben Ranish (2017), “An Empirical Economic Assessment of the 
Costs and Benefits of Bank Capital in the US (PDF),” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-034 
(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, April), available at

History suggests that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards 

and an attendant increase in risky debt levels.  I would be reluctant to see our large banking 

institutions releasing the capital and liquidity buffers that they have built so effectively over the 

past few years, at a time when cyclical pressures and vulnerabilities in the broader financial 

system are building. 

Indeed, if cyclical pressures continue to build and financial vulnerabilities broaden, it 

may become appropriate to ask the largest banking organizations to build a countercyclical 

buffer (CCyB) of capital to maintain an adequate degree of resilience against stress.  The CCyB 

is an additional margin of capital that the nation’s largest banks can be asked to build to sustain 

resilience when there is an elevated risk of above-normal losses, which often follow periods of 

rapid asset price appreciation or credit growth.  This buffer is intended to be released as the 

economy weakens in order to allow banks to lend more when it is most needed.  Countercyclical 

capital requirements can lean against rising financial vulnerabilities at a time when the degree of 

monetary tightening that would be needed to achieve the same goal would be inconsistent with 

the dual mandate goals of full employment and price stability.  Moreover, countercyclical capital 

requirements build resilience, unlike monetary policy. 

The CCyB framework, which was finalized in September 2016, requires the Federal 

Reserve Board to vote at least once per year on the level of the CCyB.  While other jurisdictions 

have developed some experience with the use of countercyclical buffers, in the United States, the 

CCyB has so far not yet been activated.  The condition set out in September 2016 for raising the 

CCyB above its minimum value of zero is that financial system vulnerabilities are meaningfully 

above normal. 



8 
 

When the CCyB rule was issued in September 2016, it was calibrated against the 

backdrop of the established levels of required U.S. structural buffers.  Thus, it would be prudent 

to accompany any consideration of material adjustments to the calibration of the structural 

buffers held by the large banking institutions, with compensating adjustments to the 

countercyclical buffer in order to achieve the same overall level of resilience through the cycle. 

Completing the Agenda  

 While we have made important progress in our regulatory framework, we still have not 

implemented a few key elements.  The list of remaining items is short but important and well 

anticipated.   

First, we are close to finalizing the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR.  This significant 

liquidity regulation is important to ensure that large banking firms maintain a stable funding 

profile over a one-year horizon.  It will serve as a natural complement to our existing liquidity 

coverage ratio, which helps ensure firms can withstand liquidity strains over a 30-day time 

horizon.  And by most estimates, our large complex banking institutions are in a position to meet 

the expected requirements with little adjustment. 

Second, we need to finalize Dodd-Frank Act limits on large counterparty exposures.  

These limits will reduce the chances that outsized exposures, particularly between large financial 

institutions, could spread financial distress and undermine financial stability as we witnessed 

during the last financial crisis.  Moreover, these large exposure limits will effectively update the 

traditional bank lending limits that proved useful for well over 100 years for today’s challenges, 

by recognizing the many ways in which banks and their affiliates take on credit exposure beyond 

directly extending loans.

I support efforts to improve the efficacy of the Volcker rule while preserving its 

underlying goal of prohibiting banking firms from engaging in speculative activities for which 

federal deposit insurance and other safeguards were never intended.  The interagency regulation 

implementing the Volcker rule is not the most effective way of achieving its very laudable and 

important goal.  We are exploring ways to streamline and simplify the regulation to reduce costs 

without weakening the key objectives.  We should be able to provide firms and supervisors with 

greater clarity about what constitutes permissible market-making.  We should also identify ways 

to further tailor the Volcker compliance regime to focus on firms with large trading operations 

and reduce the compliance burden for small banking entities with limited trading operations.  

I also support moving forward with minimum haircuts for securities financing 

transactions (SFTs) on a marketwide basis to counter the growth of volatile funding structures 

outside the banking sector.  International agreement on a regulatory framework for minimum 

SFT haircuts was reached by financial regulators in 2015, and it is important to follow through 

on this work plan.  While current market practices in this area may well exhibit much better risk 

management than pre-crisis, past experience suggests we cannot rely on prudent practices to 

remain in place as competitive and cyclical pressures build.  Regulatory minimum haircuts 

calibrated to be appropriate through the cycle could help ensure that repo, securities lending, and 

securities margin lending and related markets do not become a source of instability in periods of 

financial stress through fire sales and run-type behavior.   

Here, I have focused primarily on the reforms that are most important for the resilience of 

the large interconnected banking organizations at the core of our system.  Outside of this group, I 

favor better tailoring the regulatory framework for our smaller banking firms so as to decrease 

regulatory burden.  While we have taken some important steps to reduce burden on smaller 



10 
 

banking organizations such as streamlining the Call Report for small, less complex community 

banks, increasing appraisal thresholds for CRE loans, and reducing the frequency of exams in 

certain circumstances, there is more we should do.   

Conclusion 

History and experience show that stable economic growth is aided by strong regulatory 

buffers that bolster the resilience of our large banking organizations and help reduce the severity 

of downturns.  At a time when cyclical pressures are building, and asset valuations are stretched, 

we should be calling for large banking organizations to safeguard the capital and liquidity buffers 

they have built over the past few years.  Maintaining resilience over the cycle can be 

accomplished through a combination of structural and countercyclical buffers whose calibrations 

are inherently linked.  While we should carefully consider how to make our regulations more 

effective and better tailored, we must take great care to ensure that we do not inadvertently 

contribute to pro-cyclicality that would exacerbate financial conditions that are, on some 

dimensions, somewhat stretched.  Although I believe it is too early today to reassess the 

calibration of existing capital and liquidity buffers because they have yet to be tested through a 

full economic cycle, I look forward to efforts that are planned in future years in the international 

standard-setting bodies to assess the framework quantitatively.
