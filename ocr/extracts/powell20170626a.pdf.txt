I appreciate the opportunity to speak at the Salzburg Global Seminar.  Today I will 

discuss our current regulatory regime, and areas where we may be able to make adjustments.  As 

always, the views I express here are my own.1 

We need a resilient, well-capitalized, well-regulated financial system that is strong 

enough to withstand even severe shocks and support economic growth by lending through the 

economic cycle.  The Federal Reserve has approached the post-crisis regulatory and supervisory 

reforms with that outcome in mind.   

There is little doubt that the U.S. financial system is stronger today than it was a decade 

ago.  Loss-absorbing capacity among banks is substantially higher as a result of both regulatory 

requirements and stress testing exercises.  The banking industry, and the largest banking firms in 

particular, face far less liquidity risk than before the crisis.  And progress in resolution planning 

by the largest firms has reduced the threat that their failure would pose.  These efforts have made 

U.S. banking firms both more robust and more resolvable.   

Evidence overwhelmingly shows that financial crises can cause severe and lasting 

damage to the economy’s productive capacity and growth potential.  Post-crisis reforms to 

financial sector regulation and supervision have been designed to significantly reduce the 

likelihood and severity of future financial crises.  We have sought to accomplish this goal in 

significant part by reducing both the probability of failure of a large banking firm and the 

consequences of such a failure were it to occur.   

As I mentioned, we have substantially increased the capital, liquidity, and other 

prudential requirements for large banking firms.  These measures are not free.  Higher capital 

requirements increase bank costs, and at least some of those costs will be passed along to bank

& Urban Affairs hearing titled “Fostering Economic Growth: Regulator Perspective” on June 22, 2017.

customers and shareholders.  But in the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for large 

banking firms will produce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth.   

Our objective should be to set capital and other prudential requirements for large banking 

firms at a level that protects financial stability and maximizes long-term, through-the-cycle credit 

availability and economic growth.  To accomplish that goal, it is essential that we protect the 

core elements of these reforms for our most systemic firms in capital and liquidity, stress testing 

and resolution.   

With that in mind, I will highlight five key areas of focus for regulatory reform.  The first 

is simplification and recalibation of regulation of small and medium-sized banks.  We are 

working to build on the relief we have provided in the areas of call reports and exam cycles, by 

developing a proposal to simplify the generally applicable capital framework that applies to 

community banking organizations.   

The second area is resolution plans.  The Fed and the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation believe that it is worthwhile to consider extending the cycle for living will 

submissions from annual to once every two years, and focusing every other of these filings on 

key topics of interest and material changes from the prior full plan submission.  We are also 

considering other changes, as I discussed last week when testifying to Congress.   

Third, the Federal Reserve is reassessing whether the Volcker rule implementing 

regulation most efficiently achieves its policy objectives, and we look forward to working with 

the other four Volcker rule agencies to find ways to improve that regulation.  In our view, there 

is room for eliminating or relaxing aspects of the implementing regulation in ways that do not 

undermine the Volcker rule’s main policy goals.

Fourth, we will continue to enhance the transparency of stress testing and the 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).  We will soon seek public feedback 

concerning possible forms of enhanced disclosure, including a range of indicative loss rates 

predicted by the Federal Reserve’s models for various loan and securities portfolios, and 

information about risk characteristics that contribute to the loss-estimate ranges.  We will also 

provide more detail on the qualitative aspects of stress testing in next week’s CCAR disclosure.    

Finally, the Federal Reserve is taking a fresh look at the enhanced supplementary 

leverage ratio.  We believe that the leverage ratio is an important backstop to the risk-based 

capital framework, but that it is important to get the relative calibrations of the leverage ratio and 

the risk-based capital requirements right.  

U.S. banks today are as strong as any in the world.  As we consider the progress that has 

been achieved in improving the resiliency and resolvability of our banking industry, it is 

important for us to look for ways to reduce unnecessary burden.  We must also be vigilant 

against new risks that may develop.  In all of our efforts, our goal is to establish a regulatory 

framework that helps ensure the resiliency of our financial system, the availability of credit, 

economic growth, and financial market efficiency.  We look forward to working with our fellow 

regulatory agencies and with Congress to achieve these important goals.   

And finally, I would also like to note that work continues to address the risks identified 

with existing reference rates.  Just last week, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee 

(ARRC) selected a new rate suitable for use with new derivative contracts.  I am confident the 

broad Treasuries repo rate, which the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has proposed 

publishing in cooperation with the Office of Financial Research, is based on a deep and actively

traded market and will be highly robust.  With this choice, the ARRC has taken another step in 

addressing the risks involved with the LIBOR.
