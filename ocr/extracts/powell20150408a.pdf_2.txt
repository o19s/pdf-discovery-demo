Thanks for the opportunity to speak to you today.  In these brief remarks, I will 

discuss the progress of the economy and the path forward for monetary policy.1  The 

current expansion is almost six years old and is now one of the longest since World 

War II.  While the pace of improvement has at times been frustratingly slow, by some 

measures the recovery is now well advanced.  By other measures, there is still room for 

improvement.  Assessing the scope for further improvement will be important in judging 

the appropriate path for monetary policy. 

After its most recent meeting in March, the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) modified its forward guidance to say that an increase in the target range for the 

federal funds rate will be appropriate when the Committee has seen further improvement 

in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 

2 percent objective over the medium term.  Such an increase could come as soon as the 

June FOMC meeting.  The timing of liftoff and the pace of subsequent rate increases will 

depend on incoming data and on realized and expected progress toward our 

congressionally mandated goals of stable prices and maximum employment.  Monetary 

policy works with long and variable lags, so rate increases need to begin well before we 

reach those goals.    

Let us turn to the two main economic conditions for liftoff that the Committee 

articulated.  We have already seen a great deal of progress in the labor market, and I 

expect that progress to continue.  Despite slowing in March, job creation has been 

particularly strong over the past two years.  The unemployment rate has declined from 

10 percent in October 2009 to 5.5 percent in March 2015, a level that is not far above 

1 The views I express here today are mine alone and not necessarily those of any other member of the 
Federal Open Market Committee.
