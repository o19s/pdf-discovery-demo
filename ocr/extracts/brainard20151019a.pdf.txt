The Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act  
Outreach Meeting 

 
Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 


October 19, 2015 
 



On behalf of the Federal Reserve Board, I want to thank everyone for 

participating in the fifth outreach meeting held as part of the Economic Growth and 

Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) review process.  I also want to thank 

President Charles Evans for hosting today. 

Under EGRPRA, the federal banking agencies are required to conduct a joint 

review of our regulations every 10 years.  At the Federal Reserve, we view the current 

review as a timely opportunity to step back and look for ways to reduce regulatory 

burden, particularly for smaller or less complex banks that pose less risk to the system.  

Our ultimate goal is to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations 

and to take action to address those burdens.   

I was pleased to participate, along with colleagues from the other banking 

agencies, in the launch meeting held last November in Los Angeles.  Since that time, staff 

across the Federal Reserve System, including here in Chicago, have been hard at work 

evaluating comments and identifying actions that will meaningfully reduce burden.  In 

some cases, where we have authority and the benefit is straightforward, we have taken 

action.  In other cases, which may require interagency agreement and changes to rules, 

the process will take longer.  In still other cases, we may need to look to Congress to take 

action.  I want to spend the rest of my time this morning highlighting those areas that 

hold the greatest promise to reduce undue regulatory burden, especially for our 

community banks.1  

Regulatory Reports 

                                                 
I am grateful to Angelyque Campbell for her assistance in preparing this text.

Board.

We have heard the request to achieve a meaningful reduction in the burden 

associated with regulatory reporting, and we are taking action.  In early September, the 

Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) detailed steps regulators are 

taking to streamline and simplify regulatory reporting requirements for community banks 

and reduce their reporting burden.  As an initial step to streamline some reporting 

requirements, the federal banking agencies, under the auspices of the FFIEC, are seeking 

comment on proposals to, in part, eliminate or revise several Call Report data items.  

Additionally, the federal banking agencies are evaluating the feasibility and merits of 

creating a streamlined version of the quarterly Call Report for community banking 

organizations. 

The Federal Reserve Board is conducting a separate review of the FR series of 

reports for holding companies to identify unnecessary burden.  Of course, any changes to 

the bank Call Report forms will likely be reflected with corresponding changes to the 

Bank Holding Company FR Y-9 reports, but there are additional reports for holding 

companies that are included in our broader review.   

Small Bank Holding Company Policy Threshold 

The Federal Reserve Board has taken action to address burden concerns from 

community banks by expanding the universe of small bank holding companies covered 

by the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.  In December 2014, following 

congressional action, the Federal Reserve amended its regulation to raise the total asset 

threshold for the policy statement’s applicability from $500 million to $1 billion in total 

consolidated assets.  As a result, more than 700 holding companies (that are not engaged 

in complex activities) are now exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements,

reducing both the cost of capital and reporting requirements for small depository 

institutions.2   

Community Reinvestment Act 

The Federal Reserve Board and the other federal banking agencies have received 

numerous constructive comments on ways to update the implementation of the 

Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) to better reflect changes in the ways banking 

services are being provided and banks are interacting with their communities.  A few of 

the most common issues raised include those related to whether the definition of 

Assessment Areas should be revised because of changes in technology that allow banks 

to gather deposits and make loans far from existing branches and deposit-taking ATMs, 

whether the asset thresholds that determine the examination methods for banks of 

different sizes should be raised to lessen regulatory burden on smaller banks, and whether 

the performance tests should be revised to give more meaningful consideration to 

community development activities.   

These are important issues, and we are looking at a wide range of suggestions and 

options, which may mean it will take us time to distill the comments and formulate 

effective policy responses in collaboration with the other banking agencies.  In the 

meantime, I urge you to continue providing specific suggestions to help inform our 

interagency deliberations.

continue to apply to the depository institution subsidiaries of these companies.

Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering  

We have heard from many community bankers that they would welcome 

guidance that would assist them in meeting their compliance obligations under the Bank 

Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering rules in more cost-effective ways.  Accordingly, we 

are taking a careful look at options that might reduce exam frequency for lower-risk 

banks and might enable small banking institutions to share expert resources.  There may 

also be an opportunity to align insider abuse Suspicious Activity Report filing 

requirements with other filing requirements applicable to all other known or suspected 

criminal violations.   

Expediting and Improving Applications 

The Federal Reserve Board has received comments regarding the amount of time 

it takes to process applications.  Last year, we started publishing a semiannual report that 

improves the transparency of the applications process by providing information on the 

applications that have been approved, denied, and withdrawn and the length of time to 

review applications.3  We are currently reviewing our rules to see whether there are ways 

to expedite the applications review process by delegating additional matters to the 

Reserve Banks.   

In addition, we have received suggestions regarding possibly broadening the 

measure of the degree of competition in a banking market to include the activities of 

Internet banks.4  Doing so would reduce the market shares of other banks and the

measures of local market concentration, which in turn may help community banks in 

rural areas that are engaged in acquisitions. 

Appraisal Thresholds 

At past EGRPRA outreach meetings, participants have raised concerns that the 

requirement to obtain an appraisal on small dollar real estate loans is a significant burden, 

particularly in rural areas.  The prudential regulators’ rules issued under the Financial 

Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) currently do not 

require the use of a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser for federally related 

transactions of $250,000 or less, or real estate secured business loans of $1 million or less 

when the primary source of repayment is not sale proceeds or rental income from the 

property.  The statute allows the agencies to determine the appropriate threshold below 

which an appraisal by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser is not required if that 

threshold would not represent a threat to the safety and soundness of financial 

institutions.  The agencies adopted these two thresholds in 1994.   

Given the passage of time and changes in the condition of real estate markets, I 

believe it is appropriate for the agencies to again review the current thresholds.  In 

particular, the agencies need to assess whether the thresholds appropriately address 

collateral and credit risk in small dollar real estate loans and are reasonably balanced 

against the cost and time to obtain an appraisal, particularly in rural markets where fewer 

appraisers may be available.  Of course, the agencies would need to consider whether any 

revision to the $250,000 threshold level would provide reasonable protection for 

consumers.  Board staff is evaluating the appropriateness of the thresholds in the 


 - 6 - 

prudential appraisal regulation.  We will work with other agencies in completing this 

analysis.5   

Simplified Capital for Small Institutions 

At previous outreach meetings, community banks have asked whether the Federal 

Reserve can exempt smaller financial institutions from meeting all of the revised capital 

requirements.  Based on lessons from the crisis, bank capital requirements were 

significantly revised to make the requirements more risk-sensitive and raise the quality 

and quantity of capital.  In some instances, smaller institutions have indicated that the 

degree of categorization of risks, the attendant recordkeeping and systems changes, and 

the increased reporting burden on their institutions are generating significantly increased 

compliance costs that are not commensurate with the risk profile of the institution.  For 

smaller and less complex community banks, the benefit from this increased risk 

sensitivity may be outweighed by the burden of increased complexity, and a 

commensurate improvement in safety and soundness of the institution may be achievable 

by simply holding a larger cushion of capital measured against a simpler definition of 

assets.  To be workable, such an approach would need to provide a robust measure of the 

financial institution’s capital health and meet the objectives of the Collins amendment.  

We are currently exploring possible options.6   

                                                 
5 It is important to note that any change in the appraisal threshold will only affect federally related 
transactions covered by the prudential regulators’ rules.  The majority of residential mortgages would 
remain subject to the appraisal requirements set by secondary market, particularly by Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac.

Stress Tests for Regional Banks 

One additional item that I would consider worthy of congressional consideration 

in the EGRPRA context would be the stress tests currently performed by smaller, 

regional lenders, or those above $10 billion in assets but less than $50 billion in assets.  It 

might be worthwhile to examine the prudential benefits--the additional insights gained by 

us as supervisors as well as by the banks’ senior managers from the stress tests--against 

the opportunity costs in terms of compliance measures and the allocation of management 

and examination resources for both supervisors and those banks.  And I look forward to 

discussing this in the coming months.   

In considering these issues, it is also important to underscore that we are already 

tailoring our expectations for the stress tests to the lower risk profile of smaller banking 

institutions, and the stress tests currently performed by these institutions should in no way 

be designed to mimic the more comprehensive and extensive stress testing program for 

larger and more complex institutions, particularly the Comprehensive Capital and 

Analysis Review (CCAR) program. 

Examination Cycle 

We are also examining whether there may be scope to extend examination cycles 

for community banks with lower risk profiles and in some areas have already taken 

action.  For example, the Federal Reserve recently revised our consumer compliance 

examination frequency policy to lengthen the time frame between on-site consumer 

compliance and CRA examinations for lower-risk community banks with less than $1 

billion in total consolidated assets.  Another item to evaluate includes potentially 

increasing the number of healthy, well-managed community institutions that could 


 - 8 - 

qualify for an 18-month examination cycle by raising the threshold from its current $500 

million level.  In addition to reducing the examination burden on many community 

banks, this would also allow the federal banking agencies to better allocate resources to 

those banks that pose more significant supervisory concerns. 

Volcker Rule 

Finally, EGRPRA may provide a good opportunity to reevaluate whether 

community banks should be subject to the Volcker rule.  Exempting banks with less than 

$10 billion in assets from its requirements would significantly help reduce burden on 

smaller institutions.7 

Conclusion 

The list that I have laid out here is meant to be suggestive, not comprehensive.  I 

look forward to hearing your views on these issues as well as any additional suggestions 

you believe to be worthy of consideration.  Each of the agencies will be using the 

information gathered at this outreach meeting and our other outreach efforts to support 

the review process, so we can reduce burden where possible, particularly for community 

banks.  I encourage everybody to speak frankly and to be as specific as possible.   

Thank you again for coming.
