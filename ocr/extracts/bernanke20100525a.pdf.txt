The financial crisis that began nearly three years ago has caused great hardship 

for people in many parts of the world and represented the most profound challenge to 

central banks since the Great Depression.  Faced with unprecedented financial stresses 

and sharp contractions in economic activity, many central banks, including the Federal 

Reserve, responded with extraordinary measures.  In the United States, we lowered the 

federal funds rate target to a range of 0 to 1/4 percent to help mitigate the economic 

downturn; we expanded the scale, scope, and maturity of our lending to provide needed 

liquidity to financial institutions and to address dislocations in financial markets; we 

jointly established currency swap lines with foreign central banks (including the Bank of 

Japan) to ensure the global availability of dollar funding; and we purchased a large 

quantity of longer-term securities to help improve the functioning of financial markets 

and support economic recovery.1  Looking to the future, central banks around the world 

are working with their governments to prevent future crises by strengthening frameworks 

for financial regulation and supervision.  

In undertaking financial reforms, it is important that we maintain and protect the 

aspects of central banking that proved to be strengths during the crisis and that will 

remain essential to the future stability and prosperity of the global economy.  Chief 

among these aspects has been the ability of central banks to make monetary policy 

decisions based on what is good for the economy in the longer run, independent of short-

term political considerations.  Central bankers must be fully accountable to the public for

their decisions, but both theory and experience strongly support the proposition that 

insulating monetary policy from short-term political pressures helps foster desirable 

macroeconomic outcomes and financial stability. 

 In my remarks today, I will outline the general case for central bank independence 

and review the evolution of the independence of the Federal Reserve and other major 

central banks.  I will also discuss the requirements of transparency and accountability that 

must accompany this independence.  

The Case for Central Bank Independence 

A broad consensus has emerged among policymakers, academics, and other 

informed observers around the world that the goals of monetary policy should be 

established by the political authorities, but that the conduct of monetary policy in pursuit 

of those goals should be free from political control.2  This conclusion is a consequence of 

the time frames over which monetary policy has its effects.  To achieve both price 

stability and maximum sustainable employment, monetary policymakers must attempt to 

guide the economy over time toward a growth rate consistent with the expansion in its 

underlying productive capacity.  Because monetary policy works with lags that can be 

substantial, achieving this objective requires that monetary policymakers take a longer-

term perspective when making their decisions.  Policymakers in an independent central 

bank, with a mandate to achieve the best possible economic outcomes in the longer term, 

are best able to take such a perspective. 

                                                            
2 A useful distinction is that between “goal independence” and “instrument independence.”  Goal 
independence for central banks--the freedom of the central bank to set its own goals--is difficult to justify 
in a democratic society, but, as I will argue today, instrument independence--the ability of the central bank 
to determine the appropriate settings of monetary policy without interference--is vital for economic 
stability.

In contrast, policymakers in a central bank subject to short-term political 

influence may face pressures to overstimulate the economy to achieve short-term output 

and employment gains that exceed the economy’s underlying potential.  Such gains may 

be popular at first, and thus helpful in an election campaign, but they are not sustainable 

and soon evaporate, leaving behind only inflationary pressures that worsen the 

economy’s longer-term prospects.  Thus, political interference in monetary policy can 

generate undesirable boom-bust cycles that ultimately lead to both a less stable economy 

and higher inflation.  

Undue political influence on monetary policy decisions can also impair the 

inflation-fighting credibility of the central bank, resulting in higher average inflation and, 

consequently, a less-productive economy.  Central banks regularly commit to maintain 

low inflation in the longer term; if such a promise is viewed as credible by the public, 

then it will tend to be self-fulfilling, as inflation expectations will be low and households 

and firms will temper their demands for higher wages and prices.  However, a central 

bank subject to short-term political influences would likely not be credible when it 

promised low inflation, as the public would recognize the risk that monetary 

policymakers could be pressured to pursue short-run expansionary policies that would be 

inconsistent with long-run price stability.  When the central bank is not credible, the 

public will expect high inflation and, accordingly, demand more-rapid increases in 

nominal wages and in prices.  Thus, lack of independence of the central bank can lead to

higher inflation and inflation expectations in the longer run, with no offsetting benefits in 

terms of greater output or employment.3 

Additionally, in some situations, a government that controls the central bank may 

face a strong temptation to abuse the central bank’s money-printing powers to help 

finance its budget deficit.  Nearly two centuries ago, the economist David Ricardo 

argued:  “It is said that Government could not be safely entrusted with the power of 

issuing paper money; that it would most certainly abuse it.…There would, I confess, be 

great danger of this, if Government--that is to say, the ministers--were themselves to be 

entrusted with the power of issuing paper money.”4  Abuse by the government of the 

power to issue money as a means of financing its spending inevitably leads to high 

inflation and interest rates and a volatile economy. 

These concerns about the effects of political interference on monetary policy are 

far from being purely theoretical, having been validated by the experiences of central 

banks around the world and throughout history.  In particular, careful empirical studies 

support the view that more-independent central banks tend to deliver better inflation 

outcomes than less-independent central banks, without compromising economic growth.5  

In light of all these considerations, it is no mystery why so many observers have come to 

see central bank independence as a critical component of a sound macroeconomic 

                                                            
3 This problem is known in the technical literature as the “time-inconsistency” problem; this literature was 
pioneered by Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Calvo (1978).  This problem is analyzed in the context of 
monetary policy by Barro and Gordon (1983).

framework, and economists have studied a variety of approaches to enhance the 

independence and credibility of monetary policymakers.6 

To be clear, I am by no means advocating unconditional independence for central 

banks.  First, for its policy independence to be democratically legitimate, the central bank 

must be accountable to the public for its actions.  As I have already mentioned, the goals 

of policy should be set by the government, not by the central bank itself; and the central 

bank must regularly demonstrate that it is appropriately pursuing its mandated goals.  

Demonstrating its fidelity to its mandate in turn requires that the central bank be 

transparent about its economic outlook and policy strategy, as I will discuss further in a 

moment.  Second, the independence afforded central banks for the making of monetary 

policy should not be presumed to extend without qualification to its nonmonetary 

functions.  For example, many central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have 

significant responsibilities for oversight of the banking system.  To be effective, bank 

regulators and supervisors also require an appropriate degree of independence; in 

particular, the public must be confident that regulators’ decisions about the soundness of 

specific institutions are not unduly influenced by political pressures or lobbying.  But for 

a number of reasons, the nature and scope of the independence granted regulatory 

agencies is likely to be somewhat different than that afforded monetary policy.  In the 

conduct of its regulatory and supervisory activities, the central bank should enjoy a 

degree of independence that is no greater and no less than that of other agencies engaged 

                                                            
6 Rogoff (1985) suggested the appointment of a central banker predisposed toward keeping inflation low 
and stable as a solution to the time-inconsistency problem; additional discussions are presented in Persson 
and Tabellini (1993) and Walsh (2003, chapter 8).  Alesina and Gatti (1995) and Waller and Walsh (1996) 
address how establishing an independent, nonpartisan central bank can help insulate monetary policy from 
political pressures.

in the same activities; there should be no “spillover” from monetary policy independence 

to independence in other spheres of activity.  In practice, the Federal Reserve engages 

cooperatively with other agencies of the U.S. government on a wide range of financial 

and supervisory issues without compromising the independence of monetary policy. 

The case for independence also requires clarity about the range of central bank 

activities deemed to fall under the heading of monetary policy.  Conventional monetary 

policy, which involves setting targets for short-term interest rates or the growth rates of 

monetary aggregates, clearly qualifies.  I would also include under the heading of 

monetary policy the central bank’s discount-window and lender-of-last-resort activities.  

These activities involve the provision of short-term, fully collateralized loans to the 

financial system as a means of meeting temporary liquidity needs, reducing market 

dysfunctions, or calming financial panics.  As has been demonstrated during financial 

panics for literally hundreds of years, the ability of central banks to independently 

undertake such lending allows for a more rapid and effective response in a crisis.  On the 

other hand, as fiscal decisions are the province of the executive and the legislature, the 

case for independent lender-of-last-resort authority is strongest when the associated fiscal 

risks are minimal.  Requiring that central bank lending be fully secured, as is the case in 

the United States, helps to limit its fiscal implications.  Looking forward, the Federal 

Reserve supports measures that help further clarify the dividing line between monetary 

and fiscal responsibilities.  Notably, the development of a new statutory framework for 

the resolution of failing, systemically important firms is not only highly desirable as a 

means of reducing systemic risk, but it will also be useful in establishing the appropriate 

roles of the Federal Reserve and other agencies in such resolutions.  


- 7 - 
 

 

The issue of the fiscal-monetary distinction may also arise in the case of the 

nonconventional policy known as quantitative easing, in which the central bank provides 

additional support for the economy and the financial system by expanding the monetary 

base, for example, through the purchase of long-term securities.  Rarely employed 

outside of Japan before the crisis, central banks in a number of advanced economies have 

undertaken variants of quantitative easing in recent years as conventional policies have 

reached their limits.  In the United States, the Federal Reserve has purchased both 

Treasury securities and securities guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises. 

Although quantitative easing, like conventional monetary policy, works by 

affecting broad financial conditions, it can have fiscal side effects:  increased income, or 

seigniorage, for the government when longer-term securities are purchased, and possible 

capital gains or losses when securities are sold.  Nevertheless, I think there is a good case 

for granting the central bank independence in making quantitative easing decisions, just 

as with other monetary policies.  Because the effects of quantitative easing on growth and 

inflation are qualitatively similar to those of more conventional monetary policies, the 

same concerns about the potentially adverse effects of short-term political influence on 

these decisions apply.  Indeed, the costs of undue government influence on the central 

bank’s quantitative easing decisions could be especially large, since such influence might 

be tantamount to giving the government the ability to demand the monetization of its 

debt, an outcome that should be avoided at all costs. 

The Historical Evolution of Central Bank Independence 

Support for the idea of central bank independence has evolved over time.  In the 

United States and many other countries, the historically high and volatile inflation rates in 


- 8 - 
 

 

the 1970s and early 1980s prompted a reexamination of monetary policies and central 

bank practices.  Since that time, we have observed the confluence of two global trends:  

the widespread adoption of improved monetary policy practices and the virtual 

elimination of high inflation rates.  The improved policy practices prominently include a 

broad strengthening of central bank independence, increased transparency on the part of 

monetary policy committees, and the affirmation of price stability as a mandated goal for 

monetary policy.  Inflation targeting, in which the government sets a numerical target for 

inflation but assigns responsibility for achieving that target to the central bank, has 

become a widely used framework embodying these principles, but other similar monetary 

frameworks have also proved effective. 

In recent years, the number of central banks with a relatively high degree of 

independence has steadily increased, and the experience of some major central banks 

testifies to the importance of that independence.  The Bank of England, one of the oldest 

central banks in the world, was essentially an agent of the British Treasury for a 

substantial part of the 20th century.  When the government announced on May 6, 1997, 

that the Bank of England would be reborn as an independent central bank, U.K. Treasury 

bond yields fell sharply at longer maturities, likely reflecting a substantial decline in 

investors’ inflation expectations and their perceptions of inflation risk.  Moreover, several 

studies have shown that U.K. inflation expectations exhibited significantly greater 

stability in the years following independence.7  

Prior to the creation of the European Central Bank (ECB) in June 1998, 

independence was seen as such a crucial element that it was enshrined in the Maastricht 

                                                            
7 See, for instance, Castelnuovo, Altimari, and Rodriguez-Palenzuela (2003); and Gürkaynak, Levin, and 
Swanson (2006).

Treaty, an international agreement that can only be changed by unanimous consent of its 

signatories.  The independence of the ECB has helped to keep euro-area inflation 

expectations firmly anchored.8 

The importance of central bank independence also motivated a 1997 revision to 

Japanese law that gave the Bank of Japan operational independence.9  This revision 

significantly diminished the scope for the Ministry of Finance to influence central bank 

decisions, thus strengthening the Bank of Japan’s autonomy in setting monetary policy. 

Although the Federal Reserve was established as an independent central bank in 

1913, its effective degree of independence has gradually increased over time.  Initially, 

the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency sat on the Board; they 

were removed when the current structure of the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC) was introduced with the Banking Act of 1935.  The act also extended the terms 

of Board members from 10 years to 14 years; the long, staggered terms of Board 

members have also served as a brake on political influence.   

During World War II, the Federal Reserve agreed to peg Treasury yields at low 

levels to reduce the cost of financing wartime deficits.  After the war, the Fed sought to 

resume an independent monetary policy, fearing the inflationary consequences of 

continued political control, but the Treasury was still intent on containing the cost of 

servicing the debt.  The conflict was resolved in 1951 through the negotiation of the 

Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord, as it came to be known.  The accord reestablished the 

Federal Reserve’s ability to freely set interest rates, but with active consultation between 

                                                            
8 Beechey, Johannsen, and Levin (2008) find that long-run inflation expectations in the euro area are not 
significantly affected by surprises in macroeconomic data releases, suggesting that those expectations are 
well anchored.

the Fed and Treasury.  It was only by the amendment of the Federal Reserve Act in 1977 

that the Fed’s current objectives of maximum employment and stable prices were 

specified by the Congress.10  A clear mandate of this kind is a key pillar of central bank 

independence. 

Over the years, a consensus developed among U.S. political leaders that the 

Federal Reserve’s independence in making monetary policy is critical to the nation’s 

prosperity and economic stability.  In 1978, the Congress formally recognized this 

principle by approving a provision that exempts monetary policy, discount window 

operations, and the Fed’s interactions with other central banks from Government 

Accountability Office policy reviews.  In 1979, President Carter appointed Paul Volcker 

chairman of the Federal Reserve with the expectation that Volcker would strengthen the 

central bank’s inflation-fighting credibility, even though those steps would likely involve 

short-term economic and political costs.  Subsequently, President Reagan’s support for 

Volcker’s politically unpopular disinflationary policies and for the principle of Federal 

Reserve independence proved crucial to the ultimate victory over inflation, a victory that 

set the stage for sustained growth.11  Presidents and other U.S. political leaders have since 

then regularly testified to the benefits of an independent Federal Reserve.  For instance, 

President Clinton said in 2000, “[O]ne of the hallmarks of our economic strategy has 

                                                            
10 The Employment Act of 1946 established the objectives of “maximum employment, production, and 
purchasing power” for all federal agencies, whereas the 1977 amendment to the Federal Reserve Act gave 
the Federal Reserve the specific mandate of promoting “maximum employment, stable prices, and 
moderate long-term interest rates.”  Price stability requires that the central bank not attempt to drive 
employment above its sustainable level, and so in practice the Federal Reserve has interpreted its mandate 
to include maximum sustainable employment.  The goal of moderate long-term interest rates is frequently 
dropped from statements of the Federal Reserve’s mandate not because the goal is unimportant, but 
because moderate long-term interest rates are generally the byproduct of price stability. 
11 For example, in February 1982, President Reagan stated: “This administration will always support the 
political independence of the Federal Reserve Board.”  See Reagan (1982).

been a respect for the independence and the integrity of the Federal Reserve.”12  President 

Bush noted in 2005, “It’s this independence of the Fed that gives people not only here in 

America[,] but the world, confidence.”13  And President Obama said in August 2009, 

“We will continue to maintain a strong and independent Federal Reserve.”14 

Transparency and Accountability 

Central bank independence is essential, but, as I have noted, it cannot be 

unconditional.  Democratic principles demand that, as an agent of the government, a 

central bank must be accountable in the pursuit of its mandated goals, responsive to the 

public and its elected representatives, and transparent in its policies.  Transparency 

regarding monetary policy in particular not only helps make central banks more 

accountable, it also increases the effectiveness of policy.  Clarity about the aims of future 

policy and about how the central bank likely would react under various economic 

circumstances reduces uncertainty and--by helping households and firms anticipate 

central bank actions--amplifies the effect of monetary policy on longer-term interest 

rates.  The greater clarity and reduced uncertainty, in turn, increase the ability of 

policymakers to influence economic growth and inflation.15 

Over the years, the Federal Reserve--like many central banks around the world--

has taken significant steps to improve its transparency and accountability.  Policymakers 

give frequent speeches and testimonies before the Congress on the economic situation 

and on the prospects for policy, and the Federal Reserve submits an extensive report to

the Congress twice each year on the economy and monetary policy.16  The FOMC, the 

Fed’s monetary policymaking arm, releases a statement after each of its meetings that 

explains the Committee’s policy decision and reports the vote on that decision.  The 

FOMC also publishes the minutes of each meeting just three weeks after the meeting 

occurs and provides, with a lag, full meeting transcripts.  In addition, the FOMC has 

begun providing the public a quarterly summary of Committee participants’ forecasts of 

key economic variables and, more recently, their assessments of the longer-run values to 

which these variables would be expected to converge over time.17  The information 

released by the FOMC provides substantial grist for the activities of legions of “Fed 

watchers” who analyze all aspects of monetary policy in great detail. 

Apart from traditional monetary policy, the Federal Reserve’s response to the 

financial crisis has involved a range of new policy measures, about which the Fed has 

provided extensive information.  For example, the Board has regularly published detailed 

information about the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and the special liquidity facilities 

that were introduced.  We created a section on our website devoted to these issues and 

initiated a regular monthly report as well.18  And we are committed to exploring new 

ways to enhance the Federal Reserve’s transparency without compromising our mandated 

monetary policy and financial stability objectives.19

Conclusion 

 As a result of the crisis, countries around the world are implementing significant 

financial and regulatory reforms.  Such reforms that reduce the chance of a future crisis 

and that mitigate the effects of any crisis that does occur are worthy of our full support.  

As we move along the path of reform, however, it is crucial that we maintain the ability 

of central banks to make monetary policy independently of short-term political influence.  

In exchange for this independence, central banks must meet their responsibilities for 

transparency and accountability.  At the Federal Reserve, we will continue to work to 

facilitate public understanding of both our monetary policy decisions and our actions to 

ensure the soundness of the financial system.
