at 


“A Conference in Honor of Michael Woodford’s Contributions to Economics” 

cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  

Columbia University Program for Economic Research,  

and Columbia University Department of Economics 


New York, New York 








May 19, 2016 





It is an honor for me to speak at the opening of this conference in honor of 

Michael Woodford, whose contributions to the theory of economic policy are frequently 

a central part of the economic analysis that takes place in the policy discussions at the 

Federal Reserve.1   

The main story I want to tell today is about the quality of Michael’s major book, 

Interest and Prices (henceforth MWIP).  I will start with his predecessors, beginning as 

Michael does in his Interest and Prices with Wicksell.2 3  I shall quote key points from 

and about Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (henceforth KWIP), and following that, from 

Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices (second edition, 1965) (henceforth MIP), which 

are relevant to MWIP, Michael Woodford’s Interest and Prices (2003). 

I. Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (1898) 

1. Inflation.  The subtitle of Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (KWIP) is A Study of 

the Causes Regulating the Value of Money and its opening paragraph 

emphasizes the problem of inflation:    

Changes in the general level of prices have always excited great 

interest.  Obscure in origin, they exert a profound and far-

reaching influence on the whole economic and social life of a 

country. 

                                                 
1 I am grateful to Hess Chung, Rochelle Edge, William English, Michael Kiley, Thomas Laubach, Matthias 

Paustian, David Reifschneider, Jeremy Rudd, and Stacey Tevlin of the Federal Reserve Board for their 

advice and assistance. 
2 Wicksell’s Interest and Prices, published in German in 1898 as Geldzins und Guterpreise by Gustav 

Fischer (Jena), was first published in English (translated by R.F. Kahn) by Macmillan & Co. in 1936.  It 

was published in the United States by Augustus Kelley in 1965 in the series Reprints of Economic Classics.   
3 See Torsten Gardlund (1958), The Life of Knut Wicksell, trans. Nancy Adler (Brookfield, Vt.:  Edward 

Elgar).  Wicksell was not only a superb economist but also a remarkably interesting man, whose major 

works in economics were published starting in the late 1890s, when he was nearing the age of 50 (he was 

born in 1851 and died in 1926).  Much of his earlier work was on Malthus and Malthusianism.  The last 

paragraph of the text of Gardlund’s book (p. 330) is about Wicksell’s funeral and reads “Various 

associations and academic institutions sent the customary wreaths, but many of Wicksell’s friends and 

disciples, honoring a request, instead sent their contributions to the Malthusian Advice Bureau.” 


 - 2 - 

Wicksell follows this opening by discussing the difference between 

the ability of the economic system to adjust to changes in relative prices and 

to changes in the general level of prices.  In the latter case,  

Adjustment can no longer proceed through changes in demand or 

through a movement of factors of production from one branch of 

production to another.  Its progress is much slower, being 

accomplished under continual difficulties, and it is never 

complete; so that a residue, either temporary or permanent, of 

social maladjustment is always left over.   

Wicksell states that both inflation and deflation are evils, but that it 

is generally believed that what is most desirable is a situation “in which prices 

are rising [italics in original] slowly but steadily” (p.3).  He likens the 

arguments for this viewpoint as reminding one “of those who purposely keep 

their watches a little fast so as to be more certain of catching their trains” 

(p.3).  Rational man that he was, he dismisses such behavior--of which I am 

guilty--as not being able to survive in the long run.   

And optimist as he must have been, he concludes the opening 

chapter of his Interest and Prices by saying that “the prevention of these 

troubles by the provision of a constant measure of value cannot, in the present 

state of economic development, be regarded a priori as unthinkable” (p.7) 

2. The Quantity Theory.  Wicksell’s chapter on the quantity theory is very short.  

He states (p.41) that  

The Theory provides a real explanation of its subject matter, and 

in a manner that is logically incontestable; but only on 

assumptions that unfortunately have little relation to practice . . .4   

                                                 
4 He gives several reasons that the assumptions have little relation to practice, including that there is “a kind 

of collective holding of balances, arising out of the acceptance by banks of deposits.” 


 - 3 - 

He concludes the chapter (p.50) by saying that 

the Quantity Theory cannot just be thrown overboard.  …. It 

must be put up with, in the hope that a more intimate analysis of 

the underlying facts might remove the blemishes from which it 

undoubtedly suffers. 

3. The Natural Rate of Interest on Capital and the Rate of Interest on Loans (the 

cumulative process).  We come here to a central and famous part of 

Wicksell’s contribution to monetary economics and policy: 

There is a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in 

respect to commodity prices, and tends neither to raise nor to 

lower them.  This is necessarily the same as the rate of interest 

which would be determined by supply and demand if no use 

were made of money and all lending were effected in the form of 

real capital goods.  It comes to much the same thing to describe it 

as the current value of the natural rate of interest on capital.  

(p.102) 

. . . . . . . . . . . 

At any moment … there is a certain level of the average rate of 

interest which is such that the general level of prices has no 

tendency to move either upwards or downwards.  This we call 

the normal rate of interest.  Its magnitude is determined by the 

current level of the natural capital rate, and rises and falls with it. 


If, for any reason whatever, the average rate of interest is set and 

maintained below this normal level, no matter how small the gap, 

prices will rise and will go on rising; or if they were already in 

process of falling, they will fall more slowly and eventually 

begin to rise. 


If, on the other hand, the rate of interest is maintained no matter 

how little above the current level of the natural rate, prices will 

fall continuously and without limit.  (p.120) 

4. International Price Relationships.  Wicksell explains in Chapter 10 that while 

it would be desirable to subject the theory of policy set out immediately above 


 - 4 - 

to the test of experience, that could easily be done for a closed economy, but 

that the only closed economy in the world is the world as a whole--and that 

world data were not then available.  

He then sets out the specie-flow mechanism, and concludes on that 

subject by saying that while this explanation (the specie-flow mechanism) 

must be correct, the  

international equilibrium of prices is usually restored far more 

rapidly and far more directly.  (p.157)   

He then goes on to discuss potential reasons for the more rapid 

adjustment, the most important of which is that the price pressures on 

individual commodities that are imported or exported as a result of changes in 

prices in the two countries exert a direct influence--in the direction of 

equilibrium--in the prices of individual goods.    

5. Actual Price Movements in the Light of the Preceding Theory.  (Chapter 11)  

This chapter concludes 

The theory must … be regarded for the moment as a mere 

hypothesis, the complete validity of which can be established 

only by further resort to the facts of experience. 

. . . . . . . . . . . 

My purpose is to lay down the theoretical principles which 

underlie these phenomena, and once they are correctly 

understood their application can be confidently left to the 

experience and insight of practical men.  (pp. 176-7) 

6. Practical Proposals for the Stabilisation of the Value of Money.  (Chapter 12).  

This chapter starts with a discussion of bimetallism, on which Gardlund 

(p. 274) quotes Wicksell as having written in a letter that he was “neither a 


 - 5 - 

mono- nor a bimetallist, but a non-metallist.”  Wicksell then proceeds to 

suggest a reaction function for the central bank: 

According to our line of approach, they [proposals for stabilizing 

the value of money] can attain their objective only in so far as 

they exert an indirect influence on the money rate of interest, and 

bring it into line with the natural rate . . . (p.188) 

But  

This does not mean that the [central] banks ought actually to 

ascertain the natural rate before fixing their own rates of interest. 

. . . The procedure should rather be simply as follows: So long as 

prices remain unaltered, the banks’ rate of interest is to remain 

unaltered.  If prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised. . . . 

and likewise mutatis mutandis if the price level falls.  (p.189) 

To make this possible, Wicksell suggests the suspension of the free 

coinage of gold, as a “first step towards the introduction of an ideal standard 

of value”--“an international paper standard” (p.193).  And, on a soaring 

personal note at the end of the formal text of the book (p.196), he writes 

the question of monetary reform on international lines definitely 

remains among the most important of economic problems.  That 

its realization depends on international co-operation . . . is to my 

mind a positive recommendation.  I joyfully welcome every fresh 

step towards the uniting of nations for economic or scientific 

ends, for it adds one more safeguard for the preservation and 

strengthening of that good on which the successful attainment of 

all other goods, both material and immaterial, ultimately 

depends--international peace. 

If this were a paper about Wicksell, there would be no choice but to 

stop after this inspiring crescendo.  But although Wicksell plays a key role in 

this paper, the paper is not primarily about him.  Let me nonetheless conclude 

this section of the paper with a few additional comments.   


 - 6 - 

7. Wicksell’s explanation of price dynamics.  (continuation of #1 above) 

Now let us suppose that for some reason or other commodity 

prices rise while the stock of money remains unchanged, or that 

the stock of money is diminished while prices remain 

temporarily unchanged.  The cash balances will gradually appear 

to be too small in relation to the new level of prices. . . . I 

therefore seek to enlarge my balance.  This can only be done--

neglecting for the present the possibility of borrowing, etc.--

through a reduction in my demand for goods and services, or 

through an increase in the supply of my own commodity . . . or 

though both together.  The same is true of all other owners and 

consumers of commodities.  But in fact nobody will succeed in 

realizing the object at which each is aiming--to increase his cash 

balance. . . . On the other hand, the universal reduction in 

demand and increase in supply of commodities will necessarily 

bring about a continuous fall in all prices. This can only cease 

when prices have fallen to the level at which the cash balances 

are regarded as adequate. . . .  (pp. 39-40) 

8. Paul Samuelson on Wicksell.  In 1962 Paul Samuelson delivered the Wicksell 

Lectures in Sweden, and opened with a lecture on “Wicksell, The 

Economist”.5  Herewith three extracts from his lecture:  

A stormy rebel against the traditional religion and prudery of his 

day, Wicksell had the warm heart of a socialist along with the 

cool head of a classical economist.  (pp. 1682-3);  

. . . Wicksell spent part of his time as professor at Lund in jail.  

Whatever we may think of the state of society then, which could 

jail a man for the offense of blasphemy, one’s admiration goes 

out to the tradition of academic freedom in Swedish Universities, 

which keeps a professor’s livelihood and scholarly privileges 

immune from his non-scholarly misdemeanors. (p.1684);  

                                                 
5 See Joseph E. Stiglitz, ed. (1966-2011), The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul Samuelson, vol. II 

(Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press), pp. 1682-92.   


 - 7 - 

And here comes the essence of Samuelson’s evaluation of his great 

predecessor: 

Because Wicksell read the works of his predecessors and 

contemporaries, and acknowledged the fact; because he was 

eclectic; because he regarded all his own ideas as merely 

tentative hypotheses; because he happened to come to economics 

after Jevons, Menger, Walras, Bohm-Bawerk, Marshall and J.B. 

Clark--for all these reasons Wicksell is sometimes regarded as 

not having been a truly original and creative economist.  I am 

convinced this appraisal is quite wrong. 


While Wicksell may have lacked the broad judgment of Marshall 

and one-track concentration of Clark, to savor his genius you 

have merely to read his works on capital and general equilibrium 

(vide Joan Robinson); on marginal productivity (vide Solow); on 

the impact of technological change (vide Hicks); on marginal 

cost pricing and imperfect competition (vide Hotelling and 

Chamberlin); on business cycle rhythms generated by uneven 

exogenous trends and random shocks of innovation, which 

impinge on an endogenous system geared to produce quasi-

regular rhythms whose periods depend on its internal structure 

(vide Frisch and Tinbergen); on the proper role of government 

expenditure in an affluent and less-than-affluent society (vide 

Lindahl and Musgrave); [and] on the relationship between 

interest rates set by central banks and cumulative trends of 

inflation or deflation.  (p.1688) 

What Samuelson saw in 1962 had gradually become the accepted 

view of Wicksell in the English-speaking world after the translation of both 

Interest and Prices and the two volumes of his Lectures on Political 

Economy6 in the 1930s.   

                                                 
6 See Knut Wicksell (1935), Lectures in Political Economy, vol. I:  General Theory and vol II:  Money 

(London:  George Routledge and Sons); reprinted in 1967 (Fairfield, N.J.:  Augustus M. Kelley). 




 - 8 - 

And the references by Samuelson to the many topics on which 

Wicksell made important contributions should remind us that Wicksell’s 

Interest and Prices was but one of his major contributions, and that Volume II 

of his Lectures on Political Economy is about money, banking and credit. 

9. Wicksell and Inside Money.  In both his Interest and Prices and Volume II of 

his Lectures, Wicksell discusses the possibility of a pure inside money 

economy.  His conclusion is stated with his usual clarity: 

Only by completely divorcing the value of money from … its 

commodity function, by abolishing all free minting, and by 

making the minted coin or banknotes proper, or more generally 

the unit employed in the accounts of the credit institutions, both 

the medium of exchange and the measure of value, only in this 

way can the contradiction be overcome and the imperfection be 

remedied.  It is only in this way that a logically coherent credit 

system, combining both economy of monetary media and 

stability in the standard of value, becomes in any way 

conceivable.   

II. Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices (first edition, 1956; second edition, 1965)7 

In discussing Patinkin’s work, I need to mention that I was his research assistant 

when he visited MIT in about 1967-8, and that I was an admirer of his work and of his 

reputation as the founder of modern Israeli economics, and that later I became his friend, 

albeit a junior among friends.  Now I turn to his major work. 

1. The goal of MIP.  The subtitle of MIP is An Integration of Monetary and 

Value Theory.  Its goal was thus more theoretical than the goals of either of 

the Interest and Prices volumes.  The need for such an integration was based 

                                                 
7 The first edition of Money, Interest, and Prices was published in 1956 by Row, Peterson (Evanston, Ill.); 

the second edition in 1965 by Harper & Row (New York). 


 - 9 - 

on the view, frequently expressed by graduate students, that the field of 

macroeconomics was based on ad hoc assumptions rather than being derived 

from first principles, as is done in value theory--that is, microeconomics.    

The first paragraph of the introduction to both editions of MIP is  

Money buys goods, and goods do not buy money. The natural 

place, then, to study the workings of monetary forces is directly 

in the market for goods.  This will be our central theme. 

2. The real balance effect.  MIP builds the integration of monetary and value 

theory around the real balance effect, often known as the Pigou effect, the 

presence of a wealth effect in aggregate demand, which produces stable price 

dynamics at the level of the aggregate economy.  The first edition was 

published in 1956 and became very well known, but was also criticized, 

particularly about the dynamics of prices in response to changes in the money 

stock.  The second edition, published in 1965, responded to this and other 

critiques, and achieved the goal set out in the book’s subtitle. 

In Note M of MIP (pp. 651-664) Patinkin reviews empirical 

investigations of the real-balance effect, noting that most of the studies are in 

effect estimates of the impact of liquid wealth holdings, rather than just real 

balances, on consumption. 

3. Reviews of the book.  In an article published in 1993 in a festschrift for 

Patinkin8, I reviewed both editions of MIP.   The book had been reviewed by 

                                                 
8 See Stanley Fischer (1993), “Money, Interest, and Prices” in Haim Barkai, Stanley Fischer, and Nissan 

Liviatan, eds., Monetary Theory and Thought:  Essays in Honour of Don Patinkin (London:  Palgrave 

Macmillan). 


 - 10 - 

at least twelve reviewers, whose verdicts were largely favorable, with almost 

all recognizing that they were dealing with a major work.   

4. Supplementary Notes.  MIP includes excellent “Supplementary Notes and 

Studies in the Literature” including on the work of Walras (Notes B and C), 

Wicksell (Note E), of whom like almost all who studied him became admirers, 

on Newcomb, Fisher and the Transactions Approach to the Quantity Theory 

(Note F), Marshall, Pigou and the Cambridge Cash-Balance Approach (Note 

G), Monetary Aspects of the Casselian System (Note H), The Classical and 

Neoclassical Theory of Money and Interest (Note J), and Keynes’ General 

Theory (Note K).  In his review of MIP, Kenneth Arrow9 described the 

literature notes as “sparkling”--not a word frequently used in such a context. 

5. Harry Johnson’s comments.  In his 1962 review article on recent work on 

monetary theory and policy,10 Harry Johnson devoted almost a quarter of the 

review to MIP, which he described as “monumentally scholarly”, but argued 

that its analysis of the real balance effect was “conceptually inadequate and 

crucially incomplete”.11  

Johnson (1962) argued further that 

. . . the more elegant approach to monetary theory lies along 

inside-money rather than outside-money lines, and that the 

foundation of the theory of monetary equilibrium and stability 

should be the substitution effect rather than the . . . wealth effect 

of a change in real balances. 

                                                 
9 See Kenneth J. Arrow (1957), “Review of Money, Interest, and Prices,” Mathematical Reviews, vol. 18 

(September). 
10 See Harry G. Johnson (1962), “Monetary Theory and Policy,” American Economic Review, vol. 52 

(June), pp. 335-84. 
11 As noted in my 1993 article, I did not find that criticism compelling.   


 - 11 - 

Possibly Johnson was thinking of the central bank having to operate 

via open-market operations, through exchanges of assets, which would induce 

substitution effects, rather than through the printing of money, which in the 

first instance produced increases in real balances, which would produce 

wealth effects, but which are typically fiscal rather than monetary actions. 

6. Involuntary unemployment.  Chapters 13 and 14 of MIP deal with the 

consumption function when unemployment takes the household off its labor 

supply curve, and with other interactions between markets.  They are based on 

research by Leijonhufvud and Clower, and do an excellent job of clarifying 

the implications of disequilibrium in one market for behavior in other markets.  

This approach was developed further by Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman 

in their 1976 volume, Money, Employment, and Inflation, but began to go out 

of use and fashion in the 1980s.12 

7. Surprising omissions.  MIP definitely achieves its goal of integrating 

monetary and value theory, but shows signs of its age in two omissions: first, 

that expectations are not emphasized and indeed barely discussed; and second, 

there is no analysis in MIP of ongoing inflation--the latter omission being 

particularly striking given Israel’s inflationary history.

III Michael Woodford’s Interest and Prices (2003) 

Now we come to modern times, to Michael Woodford’s 2003 magnum opus, 

Interest and Prices.  Many of the results that appear in the book were developed and 

published earlier, for Michael has been a creative and insightful researcher from the start 

of his career.  But in the interests of time, I will start with the book.  And since the book 

is massive and comprehensive, I will focus on just a few topics of interest selected from 

it.  I also add discussion of Michael’s views on quantitative easing and forward guidance-

-topics that would have received far more attention in MWIP if it had been written a 

decade later than it was.  And let me note explicitly that Michael has continued to be 

remarkably productive, and that the topics I focus on below are among those best known 

by modern macroeconomists, but that there is far more to be learned from reading 

Michael’s work than I am able to discuss today. 

1. The Structure of MWIP.  Interest and Prices (MWIP) is divided into two 

parts.  Part I, Analytic Framework, is essentially an advanced textbook on 

modern macro models and some of their monetary policy implications, which 

introduces the reader to both useful techniques of analysis and recurrent and 

important issues in the field.  Its chapter headings are: Price-Level 

Determination under Interest Rate Rules; Optimizing Models with Nominal 

Rigidities; A Neo-Wicksellian Framework for the Analysis of Monetary 

Policy; and Dynamics of the Response to Monetary Policy.  Part II, Optimal 

Policy, is more directly policy-focused, with chapter headings: Inflation 

Stabilization and Welfare; Gains from Commitment to a Policy Rule; and 

finally, Optimal Monetary Policy Rules. 


 - 13 - 

2. The basic model.  MWIP is innovative and impressive.  In almost every 

analysis, it uses a small DSGE model, with variations in assumptions to deal 

with the topic in hand.  Here follows a typical three equation model, 

consisting of log-linear approximations of the non-linear equilibrium 

conditions of an underlying model that includes an intertemporal Euler 

equation, a New Keynesian Phillips curve, and an interest rate rule.13 

𝑥𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 𝑥𝑡+1 −  𝜎(𝑖̂𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1 −  �̂�𝑡
𝑛)                                              (1) 

𝜋𝑡 =  𝜅𝑥𝑡 + 𝛽𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1                                                                         (2) 

𝑖̂𝑡 = 𝑖�̅� + 𝜙𝜋(𝜋𝑡 − �̅�) + 𝜙𝑥(𝑥𝑡 − �̅�)/4                                              (3) 

where 

𝑥𝑡 is the output gap, �̂�𝑡 − �̂�𝑡
𝑛; 

�̂�𝑡
𝑛 is an exogenous variable, representing variations in the natural rate of 

output; 

𝜋𝑡 is the rate of inflation; 

𝑖̂𝑡 is the interest rate; 

𝑖�̅� is an exogenous, possibly time-varying, intercept of the Taylor Rule. 

3. Analyzing Monetary Policy without Money.  One of Woodford’s most 

interesting results is that it is often possible to study monetary policy without 

having money in the model.  In these cases, monetary policy is conducted 

using the interest rate as the monetary policy instrument.  As Woodford notes 

in Chapter 4, “A Neo-Wicksellian Framework”, a money demand equation 

                                                 
13 These are equations (1.12), (1.13), and (1.14), respectively, in chapter 4, which appear on page 246 of 

MWIP, the derivation of which is discussed on pp. 243-45. 


 - 14 - 

can under some circumstances be added to the model, with the amount of 

money supplied by the central bank having to be consistent with the money 

demand equation.  But inflation in such a situation is not necessarily caused 

by the quantity of money; rather the quantity of money may be caused by and 

consistent with the inflation rate resulting from the three basic equations in 

which the money stock does not appear--in particular from the gap between 

the natural and actual rates of interest.  For this result to go through, the 

money stock cannot per se be among the variables that determine the 

equilibrium of the remaining--the non-monetary--part of the model.  This 

means that the separation result is not possible if there is a real balance effect 

operating in the goods markets.  Or to put the result differently, the separation 

feature is consistent with an inside money monetary system, while it may well 

not be consistent with an outside money structure.  It is thus consistent with 

the suggestion by Harry Johnson mentioned above, that monetary analysis 

might better be carried out primarily in an inside-money than an outside-

money model. 

This neo-Wicksellian result is somewhat surprising.  It provides 

justification for the behavior of those central banks that think and talk of 

monetary policy purely in terms of the policy interest rate and other financial 

return variables, but not of the money stock.  However, we need to remind 

ourselves that it is built on an assumption that the money stock per se does not 


 - 15 - 

appear in the basic three-equation model--and that is an assumption, not a 

theorem.14 

4. The Goals of Policy.  When he turns to optimal policy, Woodford starts 

Chapter 6 by asking what the goals of monetary policy should be.  He states 

that there is a fair amount of consensus in the literature that a desirable 

monetary policy is one that achieves a low expected value of an objective 

function that includes inflation and “some measure of output relative to 

potential.”   He then goes on to point out the many questions such a 

formulation leaves unanswered, including whether to target the price level or 

the inflation rate, should greater priority be given to reducing the variability of 

unforecastable inflation, should one seek to stabilize output deviations from a 

smooth trend or from the short-run aggregate supply curve, and so forth?  And 

then the surprising comment (p.382)  

The aim of the present chapter is to show how economic analysis 

can be brought to bear upon these questions.   

This sounds simple but it is not, for the explanation that Woodford provides is 

that  

we have seen that models founded on individual optimization 

can be constructed that, thanks to the presence of nominal 

rigidities, allow for realistic effects of monetary policy upon real 

variables.  Here we shall see those same nominal rigidities 

provide welfare-economic justification for central bankers’ 

traditional concern for price stability.   

                                                 
14 It is worth noting that the money stock dropped out of many models in the 1980s because standard 

relationships between money and real variables became unstable and because money aggregates became 

difficult to control.  Or, as Gerald Bouey, former governor of the Bank of Canada, once said to the House 

of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs, “We did not abandon M1, M1 

abandoned us.” 


 - 16 - 

That is not a simple thought, but it is logical--and that insight enables Michael 

to derive a utility or loss function with inflation in it.   

Interestingly, Woodford recognizes that his result is based on several 

approximations (pp. 383-392), but is nonetheless prepared to go ahead.  While 

that choice is to some extent a matter of taste, it is also highly pragmatic--and 

some might say, a reflection of his MIT training, a comment that I would take 

as a compliment.   

5. The importance of the long-term interest rate.  Another key result is that when 

you solve forward the system above, you find, as Woodford notes (p.244), that  

aggregate demand in this model depends upon all expected 

future short real rates, and not simply upon a current ex ante 

short real rate of return; and unless fluctuations in short rates are 

both highly unforecastable and highly transitory, expectations of 

future short rates are more significant than the current short rate  


--and in a footnote he notes that this can also be explained by saying that it is 

the long rate of interest and not the short rate that determines aggregate 

demand in this model. 

6.   What to do at the ZLB, Forward Guidance, The Role of Expectations.  MWIP 

was completed well before the Fed had to contend with the ZLB--zero lower 

bound--which later became the ELB--effective lower bound--even though 

there were discussions in the U.S. economy in 2003 and earlier about what to 

do if the economy were ever to be at the ZLB.15

Kansas City), pp. 185-288.

Woodford’s views on forward guidance can be understood from the 

discussion above of the forward solution of the basic model.  Woodford has 

long emphasized the importance of policy commitment, even in the absence of 

a binding ZLB constraint.  At the ZLB, explicit forward guidance can 

potentially offset a lot of the distortion, by, in effect, reducing all interest rates 

across the maturity spectrum at least up to the time that policy changes.  

Indeed, as shown by Eggertson and Woodford (2003), optimal forward 

guidance should commit to maintain lower interest rates during the recovery 

than would otherwise have been warranted by economic conditions. 16  

Importantly, the appropriate commitment can be framed as a history-

dependent policy function responding only to the history of the price level and 

the output gap, in such a way that the impact on policy decisions of economic 

conditions at the lower bound continue, even as the economy recovers.    

A history-dependent policy rule introduces a wedge between what 

the central bank has promised and what contemporary circumstances, taken by 

themselves, would call for.  This wedge may raise difficult questions 

regarding the credibility of the policy.  Woodford believes that credibility can 

be enhanced by spelling out an explicit framework describing the nature of 

any history-dependence.  For example, as Woodford suggests in his 2012 

Kansas City Fed paper,  

A more useful form of forward guidance, I believe, would be one 

that emphasizes the target criterion that will be used to determine 

when it is appropriate to raise the federal funds rate target above

Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, pp. 139-211.

its current level, rather than estimates of the “lift-off” date.  If 

such an explicit criterion made it clear that short-term interest 

rates will not immediately be increased as soon as a Taylor rule 

descriptive of past behavior would justify a funds rate above 25 

basis points, this would provide a reason for market participants 

to expect easier future monetary and financial conditions than 

they may currently be anticipating . . . 

The very powerful effects of forward guidance have been called “the 

forward guidance puzzle”.  But the puzzle is not a deep one, for the ability of 

any central bank to commit to follow a particular monetary policy rule must 

be a diminishing function of the length of the horizon that is being considered.   

This fact serves to limit the extent to which policy can deliberately shape 

private expectations.  However, the strength of forward guidance is just one 

manifestation of a very high interest elasticity in the DSGE models typically 

used by Woodford that shows up pervasively.  For example, any combination 

of shocks that brings the economy to the ZLB for an appreciable length of 

time will display the effects of the elevated interest elasticity in such models, 

whether or not the central bank is assumed to issue explicit forward guidance.  

This high elasticity is also in evidence in attempts to evaluate alternative 

monetary policy regimes.17 

7.   What to do at the Lower Bound, Quantitative Easing.  Woodford is much less 

impressed by the potential power of quantitative easing (or “targeted asset 

purchases” as he describes them in his Jackson Hole paper).  He argues that 

portfolio balance effects do not exist in a modern, general-equilibrium theory 

                                                 
17 I am grateful to Hess Chung of the Federal Reserve Board for drawing to my attention the general point 

made in this paragraph.

of asset prices, and that it does not matter whether a particular risk is held in 

the portfolio of private investors or the central bank, for in the end the gains or 

losses of the central bank are transferred to the government, and via the 

government budget constraint, are returned to private individuals.  This is 

Ricardian equivalence in a slightly different context than examined by Robert 

Barro.18   

Whether it applies in practice is an empirical issue, with empirical 

evidence from many papers written in the Fed and elsewhere suggesting a 

significant impact in the expected direction from quantitative easing actions 

undertaken by the Fed and other central banks.19 

8. Money Supply versus Interest Rate.  At present, the Neo-Wicksellian approach 

developed by Woodford and others is dominant, relative to the explicitly 

monetary approach to monetary policy used by Patinkin and others.  I suspect 

this situation will continue.  But I believe that we need to consider both 

approaches to monetary policy, for monetary policy affects the economy not 

only through the Euler equation as in Woodford, but also through direct 

effects on current demands for goods described by Patinkin’s use of the real-

balance effect and by Wicksell’s explanation of price dynamics described 

earlier. 

9. The fundamental impact of Michael Woodford on Fed thinking:20 The most 

direct impact of Woodford on Fed thinking and analysis comes from his neo-

Wicksellian analysis of monetary policy.  Essentially, Woodford has

developed the links between fluctuations of output and inflation around their 

natural21 or long-run equilibrium values and economic welfare--a point22 

made clear by the discussion above of his analysis of the optimal goals of 

monetary policy.   

Many Fed researchers--among them more than a dozen Woodford 

students--have attempted to measure the natural rates of interest and the 

natural output gap.  Early work on these topics using DSGE models produced 

very volatile estimates of these concepts, leading to the development of DSGE 

models with more realistic features, including important roles for financial 

frictions, which fit the data better--and which bear some resemblance to more 

traditional estimates of the output gap.  As a result, these models are now 

routinely used in monetary policy discussions. 

One key lesson from these models is that measuring the natural rate 

of interest or the output gap is hard.  However, estimates of the natural rate of 

interest from a collection of structural models across the Federal Reserve 

System indicate that the natural rate fell considerably during the financial 

crisis, became quite negative in its aftermath, and has subsequently recovered 

only slowly.23   

                                                 
21 In Woodford’s and Wicksell’s analyses, natural values are those that would prevail in the absence of 

nominal rigidities. 
22 See, for example, Katharine Neiss and Edward Nelson (2002), “Inflation Dynamics, Marginal Cost, and 

the Output Gap:  Evidence from Three Countries,” unpublished paper, Bank of England, July; Rochelle 

Edge, Michael Kiley, and Jean-Philippe Laforte (2008), “Natural Rate Measures in an estimated DSGE 

model of the U.S. economy,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 32, pp. 2512-35.   
23 See, for example, figure 1 in Janet Yellen (2015), “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech 

delivered at the Economic Club of Washington, Washington, D.C., December 2,  

www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20151202a.pdf.

While estimates of the natural rate from DSGE models provide some 

information needed for the proper conduct of monetary policy, these estimates 

are closely tied to the structure of the DSGE models, and essentially ignore 

the possibility of long-term structural changes in the balance between saving 

and investment.  As a result, an alternative longer-run concept, the equilibrium 

rate of interest, has also played an important role in recent policy discussions.  

Estimates of this concept, which follow a statistical approach introduced by 

Thomas Laubach and John Williams24, have also fallen to quite low levels. 

A priority for researchers in the field is to develop improved 

estimates of the long-run equilibrium interest rate, and to develop policies that 

can influence it.  In that regard, one should recognize that in a more complete 

model than the basic three equation model laid out above, the natural and 

long-run equilibrium interest rates would be functions of many variables, 

among them fiscal variables--with respect to both infrastructure spending and 

taxation.  In particular, faster trend growth would increase the long-run 

equilibrium interest rate, and what we need most, now that we are near full 

employment and approaching our target inflation rate, is faster potential 

growth.  The neo-Wicksellian and Woodfordian approach to macroeconomics 

is well suited also to study that problem, which is critical to the future of the 

United States and global economies.

Inflation  

The subtitle of Wicksell’s Interest and Prices is A 

Study of the Causes Regulating the Value of 

Money.  Its opening paragraph emphasizes the 

problem of inflation:   

“Changes in the general level of prices 

have always excited great interest.  

Obscure in origin, they exert a profound 

and far-reaching influence on the whole 

economic and social life of a country.”


The Natural Rate of Interest on Capital and 

Rate of Interest on Loans

“At any moment … there is a certain level of the average rate of interest 

which is such that the general level of prices has no tendency to move 

either upwards or downwards.  This we call the normal rate of interest.  

Its magnitude is determined by the current level of the natural capital rate, 

and rises and falls with it.

If, for any reason whatever, the average rate of interest is set and 

maintained below this normal level, no matter how small the gap, prices 

will rise and will go on rising; or if they were already in process of falling, 

they will fall more slowly and eventually begin to rise.

If, on the other hand, the rate of interest is maintained no matter how little 

above the current level of the natural rate, prices will fall continuously and 

without limit.” (p.120)

Actual Price Movements in the Light of the 

Preceding Theory

“The theory must … be regarded for the moment as a mere

hypothesis, the complete validity of which can be 

established only by further resort to the facts of experience.

My purpose is to lay down the theoretical principles which 

underlie these phenomena, and once they are correctly 

understood their application can be confidently left to the 

experience and insight of practical men” (pp. 176-7)

Practical Proposals for the Stabilisation of the 

Value of Money

“According to our line of approach, they [proposals for stabilizing the 

value of money] can attain their objective only in so far as they exert 

an indirect influence on the money rate of interest, and bring it into line 

with the natural rate …” (p.188)

But “This does not mean that the [central] banks ought actually to 

ascertain the natural rate before fixing their own rates of interest.  ….. 

The procedure should rather be simply as follows: So long as prices 

remain unaltered, the banks’ rate of interest is to remain unaltered.  If 

prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised …… “ and likewise 

mutatis mutandis if the price level falls.  (p.189)

Paul Samuelson on Wicksell

“Because Wicksell read the works of his predecessors and contemporaries, and 

acknowledged the fact; because he was eclectic; because he regarded all his own ideas 

as merely tentative hypotheses; because he happened to come to economics after Jevons, 

Menger, Walras, Bohm-Bawerk, Marshall and J.B. Clark – for all these reasons Wicksell

is sometimes regarded as not having been a truly original and creative economist.  I am 

convinced this appraisal is quite wrong.

While Wicksell may have lacked the broad judgment of Marshall and one-track 

concentration of Clark, to savor his genius you have merely to read his works on capital 

and general equilibrium (vide Joan Robinson); on marginal productivity (vide Solow); 

on the impact of technological change (vide Hicks); on marginal cost pricing and 

imperfect competition (vide Hotelling and Chamberlin); on business cycle rhythms 

generated by uneven exogenous trends and random shocks of innovation, which impinge 

on an endogenous system geared to produce quasi-regular rhythms whose periods 

depend on its internal structure (vide Frisch and Tinbergen); on the proper role of 

government expenditure in an affluent and less-than-affluent society (vide Lindahl and 

Musgrave); [and] on the relationship between interest rates set by central banks and 

cumulative trends of inflation or deflation.” (p.1688).

Wicksell and Inside Money

“Only by completely divorcing the value of money from … its commodity 

function, by abolishing all free minting, and by making the minted coin 

or banknotes proper, or more generally the unit employed in the 

accounts of the credit institutions, both the medium of exchange and 

the measure of value, only in this way can the contradiction be 

overcome and the imperfection be remedied.  It is only in this way that 

a logically coherent credit system, combining both economy of 

monetary media and stability in the standard of value, becomes in any 

way conceivable.”

Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices

The Real Balance Effect

Money, Interest, and Prices builds the integration of 

monetary and value theory around the real balance effect, 

often known as the Pigou effect, the presence of a wealth 

effect in aggregate demand, which produces a stable 

aggregate price dynamics at the level of the economy. 


May 19, 2016 9

Harry Johnson’s Comments

“…. the more elegant approach to monetary theory lies along 

inside-money rather than outside-money lines, and … the 

foundation of the theory of monetary equilibrium and 

stability should be the substitution effect rather than the … 

wealth effect of a change in real balances.”

Involuntary Unemployment

Chapters 13 and 14 of MIP deal with the consumption 

function when unemployment takes the household off its 

labor supply curve, and with other interactions between 

markets.  They are based on research by Leijonhufvud and 

Clower, and do an excellent job of clarifying the 

implications of disequilibrium in one market for behavior 

in other markets.  This approach was developed further by 

Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman in their 1976 

volume, Money, Employment, and Inflation, but began to 

go out of use and fashion in the 1980s.
