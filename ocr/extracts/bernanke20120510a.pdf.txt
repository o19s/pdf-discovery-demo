to the 

48th Annual Conference on Bank Structure and Competition 

Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 



Chicago, Illinois  








May 10, 2012 





I am pleased to speak this morning at what has become, over nearly 50 years, 

perhaps the most prestigious conference for bankers, academics, and bank supervisors in 

the United States.  The first part of my remarks will highlight the significant progress that 

has been made over the past several years toward restoring the banking system to good 

health.  I will also talk about some of the challenges banks face as they adapt to the post-

crisis economic and regulatory environment.  I will then review recent trends in credit 

conditions, noting that bank lending has generally been improving but remains restrained 

in some areas.  

The State of the Banking System 

Since the financial crisis, banks have made considerable progress in repairing 

their balance sheets and building capital.  Risk-based capital and leverage ratios for banks 

of all sizes have improved materially and are significantly above their previous highs.  

Importantly, the 19 largest banking institutions that participated in the 2009 stress tests, 

as well as the two subsequent Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) 

processes, have considerably more and better-quality capital than a few years ago.  

Indeed, those firms have increased their Tier 1 common equity, the best buffer against 

future losses, by more than $300 billion since 2009, to nearly $760 billion.  The Tier 1 

common ratio for these firms, which compares this high-quality capital to risk-weighted 

assets, stood at 10-1/2 percent at the end of last year.  

The latest CCAR, conducted earlier this year, demonstrated that most of the 19 

firms would likely have sufficient capital to withstand a period of intense economic and 

financial stress and still be able to lend to households and businesses.  The hypothetical 

supervisory stress scenario used in the CCAR was quite severe; it included a peak 




- 2 - 

unemployment rate of 13 percent, a 50 percent drop in equity prices, and a 21 percent 

further decline in housing prices, as well as steep falls in prices of financial assets most 

exposed to conditions in Europe.  Under this highly adverse scenario, the 19 bank holding 

companies were projected to incur aggregate losses of more than $500 billion through the 

fourth quarter of 2013.  Nevertheless, their aggregate Tier 1 common ratio was projected 

to be 6.3 percent at the end of the scenario period, and 15 of the 19 bank holding 

companies were projected to maintain capital ratios above all four of the regulatory 

minimum levels--even after taking into account their proposals for capital actions such as 

dividends, share buybacks, and share issuance in the baseline scenario. 

The banking sector overall also has substantially improved its liquidity position 

over the past few years.  Indeed, large banks in the aggregate have more than doubled 

their holdings of cash and securities since 2009.  Large banks have reduced their 

collective dependence on short-term wholesale funding, and many are flush with retail 

deposits, which tend to be a more stable funding source.  Challenges on the liquidity front 

remain, however:  Some large firms still rely heavily on wholesale short-term funding; 

and the liquidity needs of the banking system as a whole may become somewhat higher 

for a while as some of the securities issued under the Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation’s Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program come due, and as the unlimited 

insurance on noninterest-bearing transaction accounts expires at the end of the year.  

Nevertheless, over time, greater liquid asset positions and reduced dependence on 

wholesale short-term funding, together with more and better capital, will make the 

banking sector less susceptible to unexpected disruptions in short-term funding markets.

The credit quality of large banks’ assets is looking better as well, although the 

improvements have been uneven across types of loans.  In the aggregate, delinquency 

rates on loan portfolios at large banks have declined substantially from their peaks.  

However, while delinquencies on commercial and industrial (C&I) loans and consumer 

loans have fallen to the lower end of their historical ranges, delinquencies on loans 

backed by commercial or residential real estate have declined only moderately and 

remain elevated. 

The profitability of large banks has been edging up as credit quality has firmed 

and banks have trimmed noninterest expenses.  Even so, large banks’ profitability 

remains well below the levels that prevailed before the financial crisis began, and banks 

continue to struggle to expand their revenues.  Developments that can be traced back to 

the financial crisis--including a still-weak economy, changes in market conditions and 

practices, and tighter financial regulations--are clearly important reasons for these trends. 

Community banks play important roles in local economies, and so it is notable 

that their condition has also improved.  Their regulatory capital ratios have increased 

significantly since 2009 and stand well above their recent norms.  As has been the case at 

large banks, delinquency and charge-off rates at community banks have declined across 

most major categories of loans, and fewer institutions failed in 2011 than in each of the 

previous two years.  That said, clusters of small bank failures can affect credit availability 

in a community while bank-dependent borrowers work to establish new relationships 

with surviving institutions.  In addition, while standard measures of community banks’ 

profitability, such as return on equity and assets, improved last year, as was also true at 




- 4 - 

larger institutions, most of the gains were due to reductions in loan loss provisions rather 

than to more sustainable sources of profit such as expanded lending.   

Financial-market indicators reflect the substantial improvements in banks’ 

financial conditions since the crisis as well as the sizable challenges remaining.  Bank 

credit default swap (CDS) premiums are now well below their crisis peaks, and bank 

stock prices have retraced some of their earlier losses and have outperformed the broader 

market this year, boosted somewhat by the release of the CCAR results in March and 

first-quarter earnings that largely beat analysts’ expectations.  However, CDS premiums 

remain elevated for some of the larger, more globally connected firms, and their stocks 

continue to trade at market-to-book ratios of less than 1.    

A number of key systemic risk measures that evaluate the potential performance 

of firms during times of financial market stress have improved in recent months.  These 

indicators of systemic risk are now well below their levels in the crisis, and, overall, they 

present a picture of a banking system that has become healthier and more resilient.

Regulatory and Financial Challenges 

Banks face a number of significant challenges as they adapt to the post-crisis 

economic environment and to new domestic and international regulatory requirements.  

The most systemically important financial firms will face meaningfully higher capital and 

liquidity requirements and continue to undergo regular supervisory stress tests.  They will

 Such measures include the conditional value at risk, or CoVaR, which is an estimate of the extent to 

which a bank’s distress would be associated with an increase in the downside risk to the financial system; 

the distress insurance premium, or DIP, which measures the cost of insuring a firm against systemwide 

distress; and the systemic expected shortfall, or SES, which estimates the extent to which the market value 

equity of a firm would be depleted by a marketwide decline in equity prices.  These measures are based on 

firms’ stock prices, CDS premiums, and stock price volatility, as well as the correlation in asset prices 

across firms.

also be required to submit so-called living wills to facilitate their orderly resolution if 

necessary.  Additionally, banks must enhance their reporting systems and improve 

disclosure.  These new requirements are critical to safeguard the stability of the financial 

system and to help prevent another costly crisis.  At the same time, regulators appreciate 

that the new rules impose significant burdens on banks.  For that reason, and to minimize 

adverse effects on the supply of credit, many of the most significant rules are being 

phased in gradually and only after extended processes of consultation with industry and 

other stakeholders.   

It is worth reiterating that most of these enhanced regulatory and supervisory 

measures focus on the largest, most interconnected financial institutions, and we are 

working to ensure that community banks are not subjected to rules designed primarily to 

constrain risks at larger institutions.  We have an ongoing dialogue with community 

banks through many channels, including, for example, our Community Depository 

Institutions Advisory Council.  The council, whose membership is drawn from smaller 

banks, credit unions, and savings associations in each of the 12 Federal Reserve Districts, 

meets with the Board in Washington twice a year to discuss supervisory and regulatory 

issues that affect their institutions.  We have also established a special supervisory 

subcommittee of the Board which focuses on community banking issues. 

In addition to strengthened regulatory and supervisory requirements, banks face 

market demands that they operate with more resilient business models.  In many contexts, 

counterparties are demanding greater security in the form of more and better-quality 

collateral or higher margins.  In addition, lenders to banks may be requiring greater 

compensation for risk, thereby raising banks’ funding costs.

Banks have also been navigating an economic recovery that has been halting at 

times.  Consequently, although the condition of the banking system is improving, demand 

for credit generally has remained sluggish, and the creditworthiness of some borrowers 

that would normally turn to banks for loans remains impaired.  These factors, together 

with tighter credit policies imposed by many lenders, have restrained somewhat the 

expansion of bank credit.  

Credit Conditions and Bank Lending 

Notwithstanding the various headwinds, credit conditions in the United States 

have improved significantly in a number of areas.  Many--though certainly not all--

businesses and households are finding it easier to borrow than they did a few years ago, 

in part because of better conditions in financial markets more broadly.  Large businesses 

with access to capital markets have generally been able to raise funds at attractive terms, 

with both investment- and speculative-grade firms taking advantage of historically low 

interest rates to issue bonds at a robust rate.  Moreover, consumers with strong credit 

histories have ready access to credit cards and auto loans, supported by solid issuance of 

consumer-related asset-backed securities. 

Banks also supply credit by purchasing securities, and their purchases have grown 

rapidly in recent months--in particular, those of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed 

securities (MBS).  In this challenging time for housing markets, banks are attracted by the 

securities’ government guarantee.  Additionally, some larger banks may be accumulating 

these securities in preparation for more-stringent liquidity regulations. 

Signs of improvement notwithstanding, credit conditions in some sectors and for 

some types of borrowers remain tight.  Mortgage lending is an important example.  Since 




- 7 - 

its peak, U.S. home mortgage credit outstanding has contracted about 13 percent in real 

terms.  Many factors suggest that this situation will be difficult to turn around quickly, 

including the slow recovery of the economy and housing market, continued uncertainty 

surrounding the future of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), the lack of a 

healthy private-label securitization market, and cautious attitudes by lenders.   

Financing conditions in the commercial real estate sector also remain strained as 

fundamentals, including high vacancy rates, depressed property prices, and the poor 

quality of existing loans, continue to be weak.  Moreover, the market for commercial 

MBS--a source of liquidity for some lenders in this sector--is still struggling to regain its 

footing.    

The Federal Reserve’s quarterly Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank 

Lending Practices (SLOOS) offers a more-nuanced view of how lending terms are 

changing.  The SLOOS indicates that standards and terms in many loan categories have 

eased somewhat further in recent quarters from the very tight conditions that prevailed 

earlier in the recovery.
2
  For example, the April SLOOS pointed to the first material net 

easing in lending standards for commercial real estate loans since 2005 and to a further 

easing of standards for most types of consumer loans.  In addition, SLOOS respondents 

suggested that stepped-up competition has induced a large number of domestic banks to 

reduce fees and spreads on C&I loans to firms of all sizes.  The SLOOS also indicates 

that demand for many types of loans has continued to increase, with demand for C&I 

loans having risen to relatively high levels.

 The SLOOS is available on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/snloansurvey.

Consistent with the results of the SLOOS, C&I lending has indeed been rising 

sharply lately.  Banks have focused on C&I lending because business borrowers’ 

creditworthiness is improving and because the majority of C&I loans carry floating 

interest rates that reduce interest rate risk.  In addition, domestic banks reportedly are 

picking up customers as a result of a pullback by some European institutions.  Auto 

lending also has reportedly been solid, reflecting strong fundamentals in auto markets--

such as robust demand for used cars and relatively low delinquency rates on existing auto 

loans.  The strong fundamentals for auto loans in turn also appear to have contributed to 

an easing of lending standards and terms.   

But, as I mentioned earlier, residential mortgage lending has been particularly 

sluggish.  Tight lending standards and terms remain especially evident.  To be sure, a 

return to pre-crisis lending standards for residential mortgages wouldn’t be appropriate; 

however, current standards may be limiting or preventing lending to many creditworthy 

borrowers.  For instance, in the April SLOOS, we asked banks a hypothetical question 

about their willingness to originate GSE-eligible mortgages relative to 2006 for 

borrowers with a range of credit scores and available down payments.  The SLOOS 

found that even when the loans were accompanied by a 20 percent down payment, many 

banks were less likely to originate loans to borrowers with given GSE-eligible credit 

scores, despite the originating bank’s ability to sell the mortgage to the GSEs.  Most 

banks indicated that their reluctance to accept mortgage applications from borrowers with 

less-than-perfect records is related to “putback risk”--the risk that a bank might be forced 

to buy back a defaulted loan if the underwriting or documentation was judged deficient in 

some way.   




- 9 - 

Small businesses owners, who in the past might have tapped into the equity in 

their homes or used their homes as collateral for small business loans, also have found 

conditions challenging in recent years.  The stock of small loans to businesses on bank 

balance sheets at the end of last year was more than 15 percent below its peak in 2008.  

These loans looked to have ticked up in the fourth quarter of 2011, consistent with the 

reported increase in demand for loans by small firms in the SLOOS.  Responses to the 

monthly National Federation of Independent Business survey also suggest some modest 

improvement in the small business sector:  The share of respondents reporting a need for 

credit has moved up from lows of recent years, and the net share of respondents who say 

that credit is more difficult to obtain than it was three months ago is notably below its 

peak in 2009.  

The Federal Reserve is keenly interested in understanding how shifts in loan 

supply, loan demand, and borrower quality may be affecting lending and, by extension, 

the broader economy.  Of course, sorting out the relative effect of changes in loan 

demand from the effect of changes in loan supply can be quite difficult because they can 

be influenced by the same factors.  For example, a shift in the economic outlook can 

affect both the willingness of banks to lend and the desire and ability of firms and 

households to borrow.  

Recent research at the Federal Reserve examines cyclical changes in banks’ 

lending standards as reported in the SLOOS--a commonly used indicator of loan supply.  

It attempts to assess how much of those changes were a “typical” response to 




- 10 - 

macroeconomic and bank-specific factors, and how much was “atypical” or unexplained.
3
  

This analysis suggests that the tightening of lending standards that occurred between 

2007 and 2009 was much greater than a model based on historical experience would 

predict, contributing to the subdued pace of lending.  These results are consistent with 

other evidence that the crisis induced exceptionally high levels of risk aversion and 

uncertainty on the part of both lenders and borrowers, constraining the flow of credit.  As 

these factors have receded and the economy has improved, lending standards have 

become less stringent.  

Some bankers and borrowers believe that enhanced supervision and regulation has 

made it more difficult for banks to expand their lending.  The Federal Reserve takes 

seriously its responsibility to ensure that supervisory actions to protect banks’ safety and 

soundness do not unintentionally constrain lending to creditworthy borrowers, and we 

have taken a variety of steps to address these concerns.  For example, we have issued 

guidance to supervisors stressing the importance of taking a balanced approach to 

supervision and of promptly upgrading a bank’s supervisory rating when warranted by a 

sustainable improvement in its condition and risk management.  Some analysis has 

indicated that, all else being equal, banks with lower supervisory ratings tend to lend less; 

prompt upgrades by supervisors when such upgrades are appropriate may thus ease an 

unnecessary constraint on lending.  Indeed, in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the first 

quarter of this year, the number of ratings upgrades for banks and bank holding

companies supervised by the Federal Reserve exceeded the number of downgrades.  The 

last time that upgrades exceeded downgrades was in 2005.  In addition, we have stepped 

up examiner training on relevant lending issues, and we have emphasized to examiners 

that an open dialogue with bank management is essential.   

We have also looked into specific concerns raised about the examination process 

and its effect on banks’ willingness to lend.  For example, during 2011, we reviewed 

commercial real estate loan classification practices to assess whether examiners were 

properly implementing the interagency policy statement on workouts of commercial real 

estate loans.  We analyzed documentation for more than 300 loans with identified 

weaknesses in six Federal Reserve Districts.  We found that Federal Reserve examiners 

were appropriately implementing the guidance and were consistently taking a balanced 

approach in determining loan classifications.  Moreover, the documentation we reviewed 

indicated that examiners were carefully considering the full range of information 

provided by bankers, including relevant mitigating factors, in determining the regulatory 

treatment for the loans.  

Conclusion 

To sum up, conditions in the banking system--and the financial sector more 

broadly--have improved significantly in the past few years.  Banks have strengthened 

their capital and liquidity positions.  The economic recovery has facilitated the rebuilding 

of capital and helped improve the quality of the loans and other assets on banks’ balance 

sheets.  Nonetheless, banks still have more to do to restore their health and adapt to the 

post-crisis regulatory and economic environment.  As the recovery gains greater traction, 

increasing both the demand for credit and the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, a 




- 12 - 

financially stronger banking system will be well positioned to expand its lending.  

Improving credit conditions will in turn help create a more robust economy.
