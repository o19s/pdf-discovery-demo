Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Conference 
 

The Puzzle of Payments Security: 
Fitting the Pieces Together to Protect the Retail Payments System 

 
Kansas City, Missouri 


June 25, 2015 
 



Thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today.  I especially want to thank 

Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Esther George for her leadership in the 

initiative that has brought us all together here today to discuss improvements to the U.S. 

payments system.  We have a diverse group of professionals participating in this 

conference, from industry, academia, and government.  It takes all of us, working 

together, to maintain and enhance a safe and secure payment system. 

The payment system touches our daily lives, whether it’s a consumer paying a 

bill, a company deciding to upgrade its point-of-sale terminals, a technology startup 

developing a new peer-to-peer payment app, or the government issuing tax refunds. 

Americans make more than 120 billion noncash payments each year.1  But it’s only when 

something goes wrong, like a data breach at a major retailer or bank, that the typical end 

user takes notice of the payments process.  

As the central bank of the United States, the Federal Reserve plays many roles in 

the payment system, including payment system operator, supervisor of financial 

institutions and systemically important financial market utilities, regulator, researcher, 

and catalyst for improvement.  Most of you are aware of our current efforts to improve 

the speed, efficiency, and security of our payment system.  I’d like to discuss that project 

for a few minutes, and then talk about four things that we should all be doing to enhance 

payment security. 

For some years, members of the public have told us with increasing frequency and 

intensity that they see the United States falling behind other nations in the speed and

security of our payment system.  We hear all the time that the Federal Reserve should do 

something about this.  But, despite our multiple roles, the Federal Reserve does not have 

broad authority to simply restructure or redesign the payment system.  So, two years ago, 

the Fed published a consultation paper that sought public input on ways to make the U.S. 

payment system safer, more accessible, faster, and more efficient from end-to-end.2  As 

we evaluated the substantial volume of public comment in response to the paper, the Fed 

also conducted research; met with a wide set of stakeholders, including banks, merchants, 

technology companies, consumer organizations, and others; and worked to enhance our 

own payment services. 

Building on this work, we released a second paper earlier this year, entitled 

“Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System.”3 This paper synthesizes a range of 

views and presents a multifaceted plan for collaborating with payment system 

stakeholders to enhance the speed, safety, and efficiency of the U.S. payment system.  

The paper emphasizes the need for a secure payment system that has the public’s 

confidence and that keeps pace with the rapidly evolving and expanding threat 

environment. 

To facilitate cooperation among the many stakeholders, under the leadership of 

Esther George, we have established two task forces:  one for faster payments and one for 

payment security. These task forces will work both independently and in concert.  The 

security experts on the secure payments task force will advise members of the faster

payments task force as they identify effective approaches for implementing faster 

payment capabilities.  The secure payments task force also will advise the Fed on 

payment security matters, and determine areas of focus and priorities for future action to 

advance payment system safety, security, and resiliency. 

I am pleased to report that we are off to a great start in the months since the 

“Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System” paper was released.  More than 300 

participants from a range of stakeholders signed up to be part of the faster payments task 

force, and more than 200 joined the secure payments task force.  These task forces have 

chosen, or are in the process of choosing, members to serve on their respective steering 

committees, which will help guide the task forces’ efforts. 

Earlier this month, the faster payments steering committee met to begin 

developing timelines, processes, and criteria--including criteria related to security--that 

will be used to evaluate potential approaches to improving the speed of the payment 

system. Last week, the full task force met to continue the work.   I am told that they had a 

great meeting--everyone was interested, engaged, and eager to get to work.  The secure 

payments task force conducted its first organizing call earlier this month and, in mid-July, 

its steering committee will meet for the first time.  Momentum is growing.  By the end of 

next year, the plan is for the faster payments task force, with input from the secure 

payments task force, to have laid out its detailed thinking on the most effective 

approaches for implementing faster payments in the United States.  Then, it will be up to 

the industry to implement these approaches.

But, before we reach the finish line, the task forces will have to wrestle with some 

tough issues related to payment security.  I would now like to talk about building a safer 

payment system.  I’ll start with two brief stories. 

First, let me take you back to the 1960s, when paper checks were the dominant 

noncash payment method and were sent by plane or truck to be cleared. A man walks into 

a bank with a payroll check.  A teller cashes the check. A few days later, the man returns. 

The teller recognizes him, and is happy to cash more checks. The checks are fraudulent, 

but the teller doesn’t know that.  The man knows that the string of numbers encoded on 

the bottom of the check determine the geographic area where the check will be drawn. So 

he creates a fake check with a routing number that will send that paper check across the 

country.  Because the teller recognizes the man when he comes back, the teller feels 

comfortable cashing the second round of checks because the first check has not yet been 

returned.  By the time the bank realizes the checks are fraudulent, the man is gone. Some 

of you will recognize that man as Frank Abagnale, former con artist and now a security 

consultant. 

Now, fast-forward 50 years to 2013.  A man walks up to an ATM with a prepaid 

debit card.  He types in a PIN and withdraws a large amount of cash.  But it’s not just one 

man:  there are many individuals doing the same thing at thousands of ATMs in dozens 

of countries.  The cards are counterfeit, but no one has detected that yet.  Over the course 

of ten hours, the individuals withdraw $40 million in cash.  How does this happen?  

Before the thieves walk up to the ATMs, hackers break into a payment processor’s 

database, steal a small number of prepaid card account numbers, and raise the cards’ 


 - 5 - 

withdrawal limits.  They then distribute counterfeit cards to “cashing crews” around the 

world who make the withdrawals. 

These well-known payment fraud schemes were perpetrated in different eras, and 

juxtaposing them highlights how the payment security landscape has changed. Frank 

Abagnale relied on the slow speed of the paper check-clearing system and in-person 

social engineering.  In contrast, the ATM thieves relied on rapid transmission of data to 

remotely steal account information and alter withdrawal limits, all without interacting 

with bank employees.  Today, fraud can be executed quickly, perpetrated on a massive 

scale, and carried out remotely. 

In light of this new environment, I will suggest four things that all of us ought to 

be doing with respect to payment security.  Some are already being done.  Too often, 

though, such efforts are overlooked or inconsistently applied. 

1. Safe Innovation 

This is an exciting time for the payment system.  Technology companies are 

creating new methods to pay with mobile phones and even wearable devices.  Banks are 

building faster payment capabilities into their deposit account systems. Banks, payment 

card networks, and merchants are rolling out Europay, MasterCard, and Visa (EMV) chip 

cards and using compatible point-of-sale terminals.  Many of the newest products in the 

market are impressive, incorporating new technologies like biometrics and tokenization. 

End users and the media have taken notice. 

History shows that we should embrace innovation.  Technological innovation has 

continually pushed the payment system forward.  Payment cards, both credit and debit, 

are an example.  Thirty years ago, everyone carried cash.  Today, young adults 


 - 6 - 

increasingly prefer to rely on cards and mobile phones.  Payment cards have improved 

convenience and security in certain ways, like reducing the impact of a stolen wallet. 

But history has also shown that new technologies must be adopted in a prudent 

fashion.  Technological innovations can provide substantial benefits to payment system 

efficiency and security in the long run, but they often introduce new, unanticipated risks. 

For example, although payments cards reduced the impact of a stolen wallet, they’ve also 

introduced new risks, like counterfeit card fraud.  It is important that we identify and 

address the unanticipated risks that inevitably result when we try new things.  These risks 

may be tolerable in the short run, so long as we work to identify, prevent, and mitigate 

them early on in the design and implementation process.  In the case of payment cards, 

over time, technologies have been broadly implemented to mitigate many of the risks.  

For instance, computer algorithms now analyze transactions in real time and can prevent 

the same card number from being used to make purchases in Washington, D.C. and in 

Kansas City five minutes apart.  

We also need to consider the complexity of the payment system.  It is a vast 

network with millions of endpoints and a wide variety of participants.  Many innovators 

do a good job of incorporating advanced security features into their individual products. 

But new products also need to be securely integrated into the payment system as a whole. 

To innovate safely, payment system participants must work together by 

participating in coordinated efforts to improve the payment system.  At a minimum, 

banks, merchants, and other institutions that process or store sensitive financial 

information need to keep their hardware and software current to the latest industry 

standards.  Network operators and standards-setting bodies play an important role by 


 - 7 - 

identifying these standards and coordinating their adoption among network participants.  

The EMV rollout that is taking place right now is a good example. 

The market should be the primary driver of change, and government should avoid 

stifling healthy innovation.  But policymakers can play a role by actively listening to 

concerns from the public regarding barriers or gaps in regulatory regimes that may create 

disincentives for developing new, safe products.  Policymakers can also bring industry 

participants together.  The task forces that were created as part of the Fed’s payment 

system improvement effort bring together a wide range of payment system participants to 

sit at the drafting table to create a blueprint for a safer and more efficient payment 

system.  

Complacency is everyone’s enemy.  Unfortunately, the firms involved in the 

payment system are not the only ones innovating:  criminals have an ever-increasing 

arsenal of cyberweapons at their disposal.  That brings me to my second point.  

2. Prevention 

You will be attacked.  Criminals today are often motivated, intelligent, well-

organized and well-funded.  They also have varied interests:  some seek financial gain, 

while others hope to disrupt our nation’s financial institutions and payment system.  What 

should we be doing to prepare?  One clear area of focus needs to be on implementing 

preventive tools, or simply put, defensive tactics.  You won’t survive the game if you 

don’t play good defense.   

The deployment of EMV chip cards in the United States represents an important 

step forward.  But we should not stop there.  For many years, traditional authentication 

methods like signatures and static passwords have been used to verify that an individual 


 - 8 - 

is authorized to initiate a payment.  New approaches to authentication increasingly offer 

greater assurance and protection.  Given the current technologies that we have at our 

disposal, we should assess the continued use of signatures as a means of authenticating 

card transactions.   

It is important to layer security tools and procedures.  Methods to devalue 

payment data, like tokenization and encryption for data at rest, in use, and in transit, 

mitigate the effect of a data breach.  Analytics can identify and prevent fraudulent 

transactions.  Firewalls and segmentation of technology supporting critical functions can 

protect networks from outside attacks. 

Also, remember that people inside your organization and organizations that you 

work with can pose a significant risk.  One study found that more than 20 percent of 

security incidents could be attributed to insiders.4 Segregation of duties, background 

checks, and monitoring for anomalies help reduce the risk of insider threats.  Strong 

vendor-management programs can reduce risks from an institution’s partners and service 

providers.   

3. Planning 

As crucial as they are, we should keep in mind that these prevention tools cannot 

stand alone.  Even with stronger authentication methods, robust network security, and 

other approaches in place, preventive measures aren’t sufficient to manage security risks.  

Such measures are designed to protect against known risks.  But those looking to exploit 

the system will continue to devise new methods of attack.  In some of the recent high-

profile data breaches, companies have scrambled to deal with the aftermath.  This brings

me to my third point.  We need a comprehensive way to think about planning.  The 

National Institute of Standards and Technology’s cybersecurity framework is one of 

many voluntary cybersecurity frameworks that provide a holistic, risk-based approach to 

planning.5   In addition to preventive measures, the framework identifies four additional 

core functions:  identify, detect, respond, and recover.  We can apply these four functions 

to securing the payment system. 

An important first step is to identify internal business processes and assets, as well 

as external threats.  You can’t protect yourself unless you understand how your business 

is structured.  This sounds simple enough, but an organization’s computer systems are 

often unexpectedly interconnected.  Some of the largest point-of-sale data breaches, for 

example, originate outside payment card systems.6  You should also keep up to date on 

cyber developments and gather information about threats from information sharing 

forums, including FS-ISAC, US-CERT, and the FBI’s InfraGard.  

Regardless of how well we identify and protect, we also need to plan for a 

potential attack.  To address this, the NIST framework calls for plans to detect, respond, 

and recover.  Victims are often not aware that they’ve been breached.  Did you know that 

last year the median amount of time it took to discover a breach was about 200 days?7  

Plans need to include methods to detect attacks.  You also need to have a response plan. 

If your point-of-sale system is compromised or your account records are stolen, do you 

know which law enforcement agencies you should work with?  You will be more

effective containing the impact if you have thought through the necessary responses 

beforehand.  Finally, you need to have plans in place to recover business functions.  This 

may include investments in new tools and approaches to aid in rapid recovery.  I would 

also advise that you participate in industry-led tabletop exercises to help you think 

through how to respond and recover from cybersecurity events. 

4. Education 

 We’ve talked a lot about fostering the security of the payment system, but we 

should also talk about the public’s perceptions.  Even if we have a comprehensive, well-

implemented security plan, one high-profile breach can shake public confidence. 

Research suggests that the way consumers feel about a particular payment mechanism 

affects the way they choose to pay.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s most recent 

report on consumers’ use of mobile financial services notes that security concerns are a 

main impediment to the adoption of mobile financial services.8  Education is a way to 

enhance both payment system security and public confidence. 

My fourth point is that, collectively, we could do more to empower consumers to 

use financial products safely by educating them on the risks they face and the steps they 

can take to protect themselves.  For example, financial institutions can provide and help 

customers understand online banking tools like credit card transaction alerts that can help 

consumers spot or stop fraud.  We also need to be prepared, to the extent possible, to 

respond to a security incident in a transparent and timely manner so that consumers 

understand the implications of the event.  Policymakers can also provide facts and data to 

paint a realistic picture of the threats that exist in the payment system.  One example is

the Federal Reserve’s triennial payments study, which presents statistics on fraud for the 

largest retail payment systems that could be used by companies and the media when 

explaining risks to consumers.9 

 Knowledge is power.  Education is critical to fostering the security of the payment 

system and, ultimately, to maintaining public confidence. 

Conclusion 

 The things I’ve discussed today apply to all payment system participants. Each of 

us has an important role to play in building a safer payment system.  Given the payment 

system’s complexity, it’s important to keep in mind that we all need to work together 

when we innovate, prevent, plan, and educate. 

I want to close by asking for your support.  With our payment system 

improvement effort in full swing, now is the perfect time for payment system participants 

to come together to build a safer and more efficient payment system.  If you’ve joined 

one of our task forces, I hope that you will maintain a high level of engagement.  If you 

haven’t, I encourage you to do so, or at least to follow their progress.  We will continue 

to seek input and provide updates through live and virtual forums, surveys, industry- and 

Federal Reserve-sponsored groups and events, and online feedback mechanisms.  Thank 

you to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City for organizing this conference and to all 

of you for participating.
