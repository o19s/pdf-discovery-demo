Insurance Companies and the Role of the Federal Reserve 

Remarks by  

Daniel K. Tarullo 

Member 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the  

National Association of Insurance Commissioner’s International Insurance Forum 

Washington, D.C. 



May 20, 2016


 It is a pleasure to be here with you this morning to discuss the statutory role of the 

Federal Reserve in supervising and regulating insurance firms.  Since we inherited from the 

Office of Thrift Supervision the oversight of savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) that 

contain insurance companies, we have looked at our role as complementing the role you--as 

insurance regulators--play.  We value the interaction we have had with state insurance 

commissioners on policy matters and are pleased with the growth of ongoing, regularized 

cooperation in supervising the firms over which we both have oversight authority.  Personally, I 

have profited enormously from the assistance provided by the staff of the National Association 

of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as I delved into the history and practice of capital 

regulation of insurance companies. 

 Today I would like to begin by describing how I view the Federal Reserve’s role in 

insurance regulation and supervision--both what it is and what it is not.  As I think you will find, 

we have tried to occupy that role in a way that is closely grounded in the duties that Congress has 

given us.  Then I will present current thinking on a topic that I know has occasioned great 

interest--the Federal Reserve’s plans for adopting capital requirements for the insurance firms 

over which we now have statutory responsibilities. 

The Federal Reserve’s Role in Insurance Regulation and Supervision 

The U.S. insurance industry has historically been, and remains, a significant part of the 

U.S. economy.  For the industry across all sectors, written premiums last year totaled nearly 

$2 trillion and earned premiums totaled nearly $1.8 trillion, representing increases from 2014 of 

approximately 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively.1  This represents over 7 percent of U.S.

gross domestic product, as it has in recent years.2  The two largest sectors in the U.S. insurance 

industry, property/casualty and life/annuities, together wrote approximately $1 trillion of 

premiums in 2015, up nearly 3 percent from the year prior.3  Moreover, for the U.S. insurance 

industry as a whole, written and earned premium last year were the highest in five years.4 

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) 

gave the Federal Reserve regulatory responsibilities both for insurance holding companies that 

own a federally insured bank or thrift and for insurance companies designated as systemically 

important by the U.S. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).  The insurance holding 

companies for which the Federal Reserve is the consolidated supervisor hold about $2 trillion in 

total assets, representing about one-quarter of U.S. insurance industry assets.  These firms are 

highly diverse: they range in size from firms with total assets of approximately $3 billion to 

firms with total assets of over $700 billion.  They engage in a wide variety of insurance and non-

insurance activities.  Some are fully domestic, while others have material international 

operations.  Some are organized as mutual companies, while others are owned by public 

shareholders.   

The approach of the Federal Reserve in regulating insurance holding companies is 

derived from its overall statutory responsibilities for financial regulation as those have evolved 

over the years, most recently through the changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act.  First, as was the 

case prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, we are responsible for protecting the safety

and soundness of federally insured depository institutions affiliated with any kind of holding 

company.  With the Dodd-Frank Act’s transfer of SLHC oversight to the Federal Reserve, that 

statutory responsibility now includes insurance holding companies.  While the particulars are 

somewhat different than for bank holding companies, the aim and many of the tools to achieve 

this aim are the same. 

Second, the Dodd-Frank Act sharpened our statutory mandate to make clear that the 

Federal Reserve is to regulate and supervise holding companies with a view to the safety and 

soundness of not only the holding company itself, but also its functionally regulated subsidiaries, 

including affiliated insured depository institutions.  Again, while the particulars differ, this 

mandate applies to SLHCs as well as to bank holding companies.5  The Gramm-Leach-Bliley 

Act of 1999 had, at the least, rendered ambiguous the question of whether the Federal Reserve 

could take supervisory measures that involved a functionally regulated subsidiary of a holding 

company unless a specific threat to an affiliated depository institution could be established.  The 

financial crisis underscored the importance for safety and soundness of not waiting until 

problems in the holding company were manifestly affecting the depository institution. 

Third, the Dodd-Frank Act also changed our statutory mandate to require that we regulate 

holding companies so as to promote the stability of the financial system as a whole.  This means 

paying attention to interconnections among financial firms, correlations of asset holdings, and 

other characteristics that could endanger the nation’s financial stability during periods of stress.  

One of the most notable differences between the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial legislation 

over the preceding half century is the frequency with which the phrases “financial stability” and 

“systemic risk” occur, either as the specific goal of certain new provisions or as a consideration 

                                                           
5 See 12 USC § 1467a(b)(4)(A).

to be taken into account in administering general regulatory authorities.  As I have explained 

elsewhere,6 this systemic or “macroprudential” regulatory aim does not apply equally to all 

holding companies or banks.  Indeed, with respect to community banks, for example, it does not 

really apply at all.  It is important that financial regulation be tiered so as to regulate for the kinds 

of risks various groups of financial institutions actually pose, rather than to regulate in a 

monolithic fashion. 

Fourth, for all the broadening of our statutory mandate, one feature of the financial 

regulatory system that the Dodd-Frank Act preserved was the functional regulation of holding 

company affiliates based on the kind of financial intermediation in which they are engaged.  

Thus, even though we do apply consolidated capital and liquidity requirements at the holding 

company level, we do not specifically apply them to broker-dealer, commodities merchant, or 

investment company affiliates.  Nor do we have any role in the investor protection and market 

functioning mandates in the regulatory regimes administered by the Securities and Exchange 

Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Similarly, we have no 

role in regulating the types of insurance offered by affiliates of the holding companies we 

supervise or the manner in which the insurance is provided.  These matters are the province of 

state insurance regulators.  In fact, because of the overall structure of insurance regulation as 

specified by Congress in the McCarran-Ferguson Act and elsewhere, the line here is arguably 

brighter than in other areas. 

In pursuing what might be termed its dual regulatory mandate of protecting the safety and 

soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies and promoting financial 

stability, the Federal Reserve must develop regulatory and supervisory measures that are

Reserve Bank of Chicago Bank Structure Conference, Chicago, Illinois, May 8.

appropriate for a range of non-bank financial intermediaries.  Consider, for example, the risks 

associated with bank holding companies containing large broker-dealer operations.  Unlike 

traditional commercial banks whose activities are funded with retail deposits, these bank holding 

companies are typically heavily reliant on repurchase agreements (or repos) and other types of 

short-term wholesale funding.  The events of 2007 to 2008 reminded us that, while this type of 

funding may be very stable during normal times, it can disappear overnight in periods of stress.  

Runs by providers of short-term wholesale funding may not only precipitate the failure of an 

individual firm by depleting that firm’s capital and liquidity buffers, but also precipitate 

contagion that can imperil the rest of the financial system. 

As a result of this very dynamic during the financial crisis, the five large, formerly 

freestanding broker-dealers have mostly been absorbed by, or converted into, bank holding 

companies.  In our post-crisis development of liquidity requirements and stress testing, and in 

reforming capital requirements, we needed to pay particular heed to these critical funding 

differences between traditional commercial banks and broker-dealers.  Similarly, in building out 

our regulation and supervision of insurance companies, we are paying particular attention to how 

their funding patterns differ from other forms of financial intermediaries. 

Here, though, the major relevant difference is that the funding structures of traditional 

insurers are generally much more stable than the funding structures of commercial banks, much 

less broker-dealers.  A traditional insurance company’s liabilities are largely composed of 

contingent claims based on the occurrence of specified events, such as the death of an insured 

person or the destruction of property.  Because these claims generally cannot be accelerated, 

companies engaged in traditional insurance activities are less vulnerable to runs and, 

accordingly, to short-term pressures to sell assets into declining markets.  This insulation from 


6 
 


creditor runs in turn suggests that capital and liquidity requirements for insurance companies 

should be calibrated differently than capital and liquidity requirements for dealer banks.  Because 

Congress modified the Collins Amendment in late 2014, we can now tailor capital requirements 

for insurance companies.   

However, it is important to add that the balance sheet of an insurance company can look 

quite different from the traditional picture I have just sketched.  For example, a life insurer may 

offer investment and retirement products with account values that can be withdrawn at the 

discretion of policyholders, sometimes with little or no surrender penalty.  The option to 

surrender creates the potential for increased claims that could strain the liquidity of the firm.  

Relatedly, the extensive involvement of an insurance firm in securities lending, repo, over-the-

counter derivatives, and other capital markets activities can create a balance sheet with much 

tighter connections to the rest of the financial system and greater liquidity risk in times of 

financial market stress.  As with other financial intermediaries, insurers then become subject to 

demands for posting additional collateral or closing out positions as unfavorable market 

conditions take hold.  In addition, if the positions of the insurance company are large enough, it 

could become a potential vehicle for transmitting distress at the company to other parts of the 

financial system.   

The foregoing considerations suggest that we should distinguish between insurance 

companies that we oversee solely because they own an insured depository institution and those 

that have been designated as systemically important by the FSOC.  This is precisely the path we 

are taking with regard to our supervision of these firms.  For the former group, our supervisory 

efforts to date have focused on ensuring that the companies have strong internal controls and 

effective corporate governance, as well as satisfactory risk identification, measurement, and 


7 
 


management.  For firms designated as systemically important, our supervision has additionally 

emphasized capital and liquidity planning and positions, management of core business lines, and 

recovery and resolution planning.  Board staff meets with the primary state insurance 

departments that supervise the insurance companies for which we have consolidated supervisory 

responsibility and, together with lead state supervisors, we co-host supervisory colleges and 

crisis management groups for AIG (American International Group, Inc.) and Prudential.  We 

continue to discuss supervisory plans and findings for the insurance firms, extend invitations for 

joint inspection activities, and discuss common areas of supervisory focus.   

As you likely know, the Board is also working to develop a regulatory framework for its 

supervised insurance companies.  The Dodd-Frank Act authorizes the Board to establish 

minimum capital requirements for both systemically important insurance companies and SLHCs 

and bank holding companies predominantly engaged in insurance activities.  For systemically 

important insurance companies, the Dodd-Frank Act directs the Board to establish enhanced 

prudential standards in order to mitigate risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the 

material distress, failure, or ongoing activities of these companies.  The enhanced prudential 

standards must include, among other things, enhanced capital requirements, liquidity 

requirements, corporate governance and risk-management standards, and resolution planning 

requirements.  We have already established resolution planning requirements for the systemically 

important firms.  At present, we have three major regulatory initiatives underway for our 

supervised insurance firms: first, reporting requirements for the systemically important firms; 

second, enhanced corporate governance, risk management, and liquidity standards for those same 

firms; and third, capital requirements for all supervised insurance firms.  Let me say a few words 


8 
 


about the first two and then spend the rest of my remarks on capital requirements, which I know 

are probably of the greatest interest. 

About a month ago, the Federal Reserve proposed new reporting requirements 

specifically for the systemically important insurance companies.7  These reporting requirements 

are designed, among other things, to keep us informed as to the financial condition and risk 

profile of these firms, as well as the extent to which their activities and operations could pose a 

threat to the financial stability of the United States.  The proposed reporting requirements differ 

substantially from reporting requirements for bank holding companies, and from available U.S. 

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (U.S. GAAP) financial information filed with the 

SEC.  They are highly tailored to the assets, liabilities, and risks of insurance companies.  We 

look forward to receiving public comment on the proposal.  

Regarding enhanced prudential standards, the Federal Reserve’s enhanced corporate 

governance and risk-management standards for systemically important insurance companies will 

likely build on the core provisions of our consolidated supervisory framework for large domestic 

and foreign banking organizations, with appropriate adjustments to reflect these firms’ 

predominantly insurance business model.8  The framework will mandate standards for the 

systemically important insurance companies to follow in managing risk and will identify the 

parties responsible for ensuring the integrity of a company’s risk-management practices.  

Enhanced liquidity requirements will likely include internal control requirements, general 

comprehensive cash flow projections, contingency plans to manage liquidity stress events, and 

internal liquidity stress testing requirements.  I expect that these proposed enhanced prudential

standards for systemically important insurance companies will be considered by the Board in the 

coming weeks.  Of course, we look forward to public comment on these standards, once 

proposed.  

Capital Requirements for Insurance Companies Supervised by the Federal Reserve 

In formulating capital standards for the insurance companies we supervise, our goals 

should track our overall goals in financial regulation, as I described them a few moments ago.  

Thus we should aim, first, to protect depository institutions and, second, to promote financial 

stability in a manner that takes account of both the unique form of financial intermediation 

reflected in the traditional insurance business and the activities by a few firms that are much 

more closely connected to short-term financial markets and the rest of the financial system.  As 

with some of the other measures I have mentioned, these factors argue for different approaches 

to capital requirements for the systemically important insurance companies, on the one hand, and 

for the rest of the insurance companies we supervise, on the other.  That is, indeed, the direction 

in which I believe we are headed. 

There are, as all of you know, a lot of ideas out there as to how we should construct the 

capital requirements we will apply to insurance companies.  Some, such as variations on the 

Solvency II approach used in the European Union, strike us as unpromising.  The valuation 

frameworks for insurance liabilities adopted in Solvency II differ starkly from U.S. GAAP and 

may introduce excessive volatility.  Such an approach would also be inconsistent with our strong 

preference for building a predominantly standardized risk-based capital rule that enables 

comparisons across firms without excessive reliance on internal models.  Finally, it appears that 

Solvency II could be quite pro-cyclical. 


10 
 


Other ideas have some conceptual appeal, but strike us as impractical for the foreseeable 

future.  Most prominent among these is an approach based on internal cash flow stress testing.  

The appeal of this idea lies in its melding of capital and liquidity considerations.  The 

relationship between a firm’s capital levels and liquidity profile is something that needs to be 

kept in mind when formulating regulatory regimes for all forms of financial intermediaries.  

However, as I noted earlier, we are reluctant to rely on internal models for basic regulatory 

capital requirements, which makes this idea less appealing to us.  The novelty and untested 

nature of this idea as a basis for regulation would, in any case, necessitate extensive 

development, likely over a period of years.  While we have consciously taken a good bit of time 

in considering a capital regime for our supervised insurance firms in order to make sure we get it 

right, we cannot wait years more, especially because there is no guarantee that even this 

investment of effort would produce a feasible internal models-based capital rule.  However, I 

think it is worth continuing to explore internal cash flow stress testing as we build the 

supervisory stress testing program for systemically important insurance companies. 

Another set of possibilities is raised by the work of the International Association of 

Insurance Supervisors (IAIS).  As part of its effort to create a common framework for the 

supervision of internationally active insurance groups, the IAIS began work on a comprehensive 

insurance capital standard (ICS) in 2013, issued an initial consultative proposal on the ICS in late 

2014, and will continue work on the ICS for at least the next few years.  The ICS would be the 

first international, group-wide capital standard broadly applicable to internationally active 

insurance groups and would incorporate internationally compatible valuation principles, 

definitions of capital resources, and risk-based capital requirements for assets and insurance 

liabilities.   


11 
 


Progress in developing such a global capital standard for internationally active insurance 

firms has been slow.  I will mention some of the difficulties that have been encountered.  First, 

there is considerable heterogeneity among the insurance products offered in different 

jurisdictions.  As one example, annuities and other savings and retirement products tend to be 

offered less frequently in countries with relatively expansive government pension programs.  In 

the context of developing capital requirements, a second factor has been jurisdictional variations 

in accounting and valuation standards on which global capital requirements for insurance 

companies can be built.  A third factor has been significant disagreement on the extent to which 

capital standards for internationally active insurance companies should be built on internal 

models.  These challenges and the protracted process they have occasioned have, as a practical 

matter, rendered the ICS insufficiently developed to be an option as the Federal Reserve moves 

forward with capital requirements applicable to the insurance companies we supervise. 

A second relevant initiative of the IAIS involves the design of an enhanced regulatory 

and supervisory framework for global systemically important insurers (G-SIIs).  In 2014, the 

IAIS released the Basic Capital Requirement (BCR) for G-SIIs.  It is the first international 

consolidated capital standard developed for the insurance industry.  The IAIS developed the 

BCR in an effort to ensure the soundness of global insurance firms with the largest systemic 

footprints.  In 2015, the IAIS supplemented the BCR with a Higher Loss Absorbency (HLA) 

capital standard for G-SIIs.  But the IAIS will need to revisit the BCR after the first version of 

ICS is complete and will also need to revisit HLA after further refinement is made on its G-SII 

identification methodology.  This somewhat provisional character of the BCR, along with its 

reliance on a method of valuation not in use by U.S. companies and regulators, mean it does not 


12 
 


really fit our need for an approach that can--as a practical matter--be developed and implemented 

in the relatively near term. 

These are some of the paths we do not intend to take in formulating capital requirements 

for insurance firms.  The approach we do intend to follow will be elaborated in what I anticipate 

will be an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) to be issued in the coming weeks.  As 

I suggested earlier, the ANPR will likely put forward two different methodologies--one for the 

insurance firms that we supervise solely because they own a bank or thrift and the other for the 

firms designated as systemically important. 

A. Insurance Companies Owning a Bank or Thrift: The Building Block Approach 

The Federal Reserve has traditionally set capital requirements for holding companies on a 

consolidated basis.  Among other things, a consolidated capital standard deters firms from 

moving assets around its affiliates in order to take advantage of lower requirements applied to 

different affiliates for particular assets.  Insofar as publicly traded banking organizations are 

required by securities laws to file consolidated, U.S. GAAP-consistent financial statements, there 

is both a parallelism between accounting and capital regulation and a measure of economy in the 

compliance costs of a consolidated capital rule.   

In contrast, most insurance firms subject to our regulation only because they own 

depository institutions do not produce consolidated financial statements.  Furthermore, Congress 

has prohibited the Federal Reserve from requiring insurance firms that file only Statutory 

Accounting Principles (SAP) financial statements to produce U.S. GAAP consolidated financial 

statements.9  Given that these firms have not been designated systemically important and that the 

depository institutions they own tend to be relatively small parts of the total firm, the compliance 

                                                           
9 The SAP are a set of accounting rules for insurance companies established by the NAIC and used to prepare those 
companies’ financial statements.  


13 
 


costs of requiring a move to some non-U.S. GAAP form of consolidated approach may well not 

be worth the incremental safety and soundness benefits of doing so.  Together, these 

considerations are leading us to what we refer to as the building block approach (BBA), which is 

likely the approach that we will put forth for comment in the ANPR for this group of firms.   

The BBA would aggregate capital resources and capital requirements across the different 

legal entities in the group to calculate combined, group-level capital resources and requirements.  

A firm’s aggregate capital requirements generally would be the sum of the capital requirements 

at each subsidiary.  The capital requirement for each regulated insurance or depository institution 

subsidiary generally would be based on the regulatory capital rules of that subsidiary’s lead 

regulator--whether a state or foreign insurance regulator or a federal banking regulator for 

depository institutions.  The regulatory capital requirement for any non-insurance, non-banking 

subsidiaries--which at present are relatively minor parts of these firms--would probably be 

determined under the standardized risk-based capital rules applicable to affiliates of bank holding 

companies.  

Should we adopt this approach, we will need to develop a formula or scalar to put the 

different regulatory regimes on a comparable basis.  With an eye towards the kind of issues that 

are usually addressed by a consolidated capital approach, we will also need to fashion standards 

for adjustments to address inter-company transactions and possibly some other exposures.  An 

example of the latter would be potential adjustments to harmonize permitted accounting practices 

that vary across states.     

The BBA would efficiently leverage existing legal-entity-level regulatory capital 

frameworks that already apply to the various units of the supervised insurance group.  As such, 

it would involve relatively low regulatory burden for these entities, even as it produces 


14 
 


regulatory capital requirements that are reasonably well tailored to the insurance-related risks for 

each distinct jurisdiction and business line of the group. 

B. Systemically Important Insurance Companies: The Consolidated Approach 

By definition, the insurance companies designated by the FSOC are systemically 

important.  For these firms, application of an aggregated approach like that of the BBA could 

pose significant risks to the Federal Reserve’s statutory aims of safety and soundness and 

financial stability.  The BBA, recall, would simply aggregate capital requirements that may not 

be founded upon financial stability considerations.  A consolidated form of capital requirements 

is key to ensuring that risks to the financial system as a whole (as compared, say, to investor or 

policyholder protection) are accounted for. 

For these firms, then, the ANPR is likely to seek comment on what we have internally 

been calling the consolidated approach (CA).  Let me note at the outset that this is not the 

consolidated capital framework we apply to bank holding companies.  As with our capital 

requirements for bank holding companies, the CA would categorize all of the consolidated 

insurance group’s assets and insurance liabilities into risk segments, apply risk factors to the 

amounts in each segment, and then set a minimum ratio of required capital comparing the 

consolidated capital requirements to the group’s consolidated capital resources.  However, the 

CA would use risk weights or risk factors that are more appropriate for the longer-term nature of 

most insurance liabilities.  

Like the BCR of the IAIS, the CA would take a consolidated approach to capital 

requirements.  However, unlike the BCR, the foundation of the CA would be consolidated 

financial information based on U.S. GAAP, with appropriate adjustments for regulatory 

purposes.  Our current thought is that the CA would initially be relatively simple in design, with 


15 
 


a relatively small number of risk categories.  Thus there would be a broad risk segmentation of 

asset classes and insurance liabilities.  However, as we gained experience with the CA, we would 

have the option of making it increasingly granular in order to achieve greater risk sensitivity.   

The CA, as a consolidated capital framework, would help prevent intra-group regulatory 

arbitrage opportunities and the potential for double leverage.10  It would also be compatible with 

supervisory stress testing, which--as you all know--is now a central component of our 

supervisory program for making systemically important firms highly resilient, as well as for 

giving us a more complete picture of risks in the financial system as a whole.  Obviously, the 

compliance costs associated with the CA will be higher than those of the BBA.  But this 

enhanced regulation is justified by the increased risks to the financial system associated with 

these firms.  Indeed, it is our obligation under the Dodd-Frank Act to impose stricter regulation 

on these firms.  Even so, by constructing a separate consolidated approach to capital for 

systemically designated insurance firms, compliance costs for these firms should be considerably 

lower than if they had to conform to the bank holding company capital regime.  Finally, I would 

note that adoption by the Federal Reserve of a fully consolidated capital requirement for 

systemically important insurance companies might also help advance the international 

development of appropriate and effective capital requirements for insurance firms of global 

systemic importance. 

Conclusion 

As noted earlier, the Board’s prudential regulatory objectives pertaining to supervised 

insurance companies are to protect the safety and soundness of the consolidated company, to 

protect any subsidiary depository institutions of the company, and to mitigate any threats to

financial stability that might be posed by the activities, material financial distress, or failure of 

the company.  Just as we have done with other non-bank financial intermediaries for which we 

have been given regulatory responsibilities, we will fashion a regime that takes account of the 

particular characteristics and risks of those intermediaries.  We have taken a good bit of time in 

arriving at some potential insurance regulatory capital frameworks precisely because we wanted 

to consider these issues thoroughly.  Our tentative conclusion is that a bifurcated approach to a 

capital regime for insurance companies makes sense in light of these considerations.  But we 

anticipate using the vehicle of an ANPR in order to give all interested parties an opportunity to 

comment on this approach before we turn to developing and proposing its details.  In this 

process, we of course especially welcome the views of those of you on the front lines of 

insurance supervision. 

Thank you very much.
