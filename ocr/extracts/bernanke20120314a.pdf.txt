Community Banking  





Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


Prerecorded for Delivery 


at the 


Independent Community Bankers of America National Convention and Techworld 


Nashville, Tennessee 




March 14, 2012 



I’m glad to have the chance to speak again to the Independent Community 

Bankers of America, even if it’s by way of prerecorded remarks.  This will be the first 

time in quite a few years that I haven’t been with you in person, but, as you may know, 

the Federal Open Market Committee met just yesterday in Washington, so I am unable to 

join you in Nashville.  I have very much enjoyed attending these annual ICBA get-

togethers, especially since I get the chance to hear directly from you about what’s 

happening in your local economies and in community banking more generally.  It’s a 

tradition I hope to reestablish in the future. 

The Role of Community Banks in a Challenging Economy  

Community banks remain a critical component of our financial system and our 

economy.  They help keep their local economies vibrant and growing by taking on and 

managing the risks of local lending, which larger banks may be unwilling or unable to do.  

They often respond with greater agility to lending requests than their national competitors 

because of their detailed knowledge of the needs of their customers and their close ties to 

the communities they serve.  

As you well know, however, community banks are also facing difficult 

challenges.  Their close ties to local economies are, on balance, a source of strength, but a 

drawback of those ties is that the fortunes of communities and their banks tend to rise and 

fall together.  Another concern for community banks is the narrowing of the range of 

their profitable lending activities:  Because larger banks have used their scale to gain a 

pricing advantage in volume-driven businesses such as consumer lending, community 

banks have tended to specialize in other areas, such as loans secured by commercial real

estate.  That said, I know that community banks are continuing to look for ways to 

prudently diversify their revenue sources.   

Like larger banks, community banks are also being affected by the state of the 

national economy.  Despite some recent signs of improvement, the recovery has been 

frustratingly slow, constraining opportunities for profitable lending.  And, as I will 

discuss momentarily, actual and prospective changes in the regulatory landscape have 

also raised concerns among community bankers. 

The good news is that, for the most part, community banks appear to be meeting 

their challenges.  Profits of smaller banks were considerably higher in 2011 than in the 

previous year, nonperforming assets were lower, provisions for loan losses fell 

appreciably, and capital ratios improved. 

Outreach and Communication with Community Banks 

As I noted, together with economic conditions, regulation and supervision are 

among the top concerns for community banks.  In that regard, I think we would all agree 

that two-way communication between regulators and community banks is critical.  Banks 

need to understand supervisors’ policies and expectations, but supervisors must also 

listen to and understand banks’ concerns. 

At the Federal Reserve, we pursue our dialogue with community bankers through 

many channels.  One important channel is the recently established Community 

Depository Institutions Advisory Council (CDIAC).
1
  The council’s membership is 

drawn from smaller banks, credit unions, and savings associations.  Each of the 

12 Reserve Banks around the country has a local advisory council, and one representative

from each local council serves on the national council that meets with the Board in 

Washington twice a year.   

At a recent meeting, for example, one of our CDIAC members asked us to be 

clearer about whether particular rules and guidance apply to community banks.  Having 

heard from this banker as well as others, we are now working to more explicitly indicate 

which banks will be affected when we issue new regulatory proposals, final rules, or 

regulatory guidance.  Although this change seems relatively simple, we hope it will help 

banks avoid allocating precious resources to poring over supervisory guidance that does 

not apply to them. 

In addition to the advisory council, the Board last year established a supervision 

subcommittee on smaller regional and community banking.  Because of their professional 

backgrounds in community banking and bank supervision, I asked Governors Elizabeth 

Duke and Sarah Bloom Raskin to serve on this subcommittee.  Its primary role is to 

improve our understanding of community and regional banking conditions and to review 

policy proposals for their potential effect on the safety and soundness of, and the 

regulatory costs imposed on, community and regional institutions.

  Governors Duke and 

Raskin are also keenly interested in how our policies could affect the availability of credit 

to sound borrowers. 

We have other contacts with community banks that have proved valuable.  For 

quite a few years, the Reserve Banks have maintained local training and outreach 

programs for banks.  More recently, several of these programs have been expanded

 For the purposes of the Federal Reserve’s supervisory programs, regional banking organizations generally 

are considered to be those banks and bank holding companies (including savings and loan holding 

companies) with total consolidated assets between $10 billion and $50 billion.

nationally.  For example, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis organizes national “Ask 

the Fed” calls to provide bankers with an opportunity to hear Federal Reserve staff 

discuss recent policy initiatives and issues that examiners are encountering in the field.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco hosts consumer compliance 

webinars, and the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia publishes a quarterly overview 

of consumer compliance issues that allows Federal Reserve staff to address questions 

from banks.

  We are exploring options for building on these initiatives.  It is critical to 

keep the communications channels open if supervisors and banks are to work together 

constructively.   

The Regulation and Supervision of Community Banks 

Bank supervision requires a delicate balance--particularly now.  The weak 

economy, together with loose lending standards in the past, has put pressure on the entire 

banking industry, including community banks.  To protect banks from new problems 

down the road, and to safeguard the Deposit Insurance Fund, supervisors must insist on 

high standards for lending, risk management, and governance.  At the same time, it is 

important for banks, for their communities, and for the national economy that banks lend 

to creditworthy borrowers.  Lending to creditworthy borrowers, after all, is how banks 

earn profits. 

We also know that supervision imposes costs on institutions, and we recognize 

that new regulations and supervisory requirements may impose disproportionate costs on 

community banks.  Thus, we take quite seriously the importance of evaluating the costs

and benefits of new rules.  Supervision is conducted through the Federal Reserve’s 

decentralized structure of 12 regional Reserve Banks, which helps us tailor our 

examinations and supervision to the size, complexity, risk profile, and business model of 

each institution.   

Community bankers tell us repeatedly that they are concerned about the changing 

regulatory environment.  One particular worry is the implementation of the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act).  It is important to 

emphasize that the Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act largely in response to the “too 

big to fail” problem, and that most of its provisions--regarding, for example, capital, 

liquidity, and risk management--apply only, or principally, to the largest, most complex, 

and internationally active banks.  These new standards are not meant to apply to, and 

clearly would not be appropriate for, community banks.  We will work to maintain a clear 

distinction between community banks and larger institutions in the application of new 

regulations.  

Conclusion 

To conclude, I would like to reemphasize the importance that my colleagues on 

the Board and I place on the Federal Reserve’s relationship with community banks.  The 

Fed is committed to fair, consistent, and informed examinations that take into account the 

size, complexity, and individual circumstances of each bank we oversee.  We will do all 

we can to support the banks’ safety and soundness and eliminate unnecessary costs.  

Despite economic uncertainties, the condition of community banks is improving.  That’s 

good news not only for banks, but for their communities and the national economy as 

well.  Thanks, and enjoy the rest of your meetings.
