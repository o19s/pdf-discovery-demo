We recognize the potential of distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to 

transform the way financial market participants transfer, store, and maintain ownership 

records of digitized assets.  The genuinely innovative aspect of distributed ledger 

technology combines a number of core elements that can be used to support the transfer 

process and distributed recordkeeping for digital assets and digital representations of 

assets.  These elements include peer-to-peer networking and distributed data records, 

which provide broadly shared access to a single ledger across participants in the system, 

so that all participants maintain a shared, accurate history of all transactions in the 

system.  In addition, cryptography provides a secure way to initiate a valid transaction as 

well as to securely transmit and store data.  And consensus algorithms provide a process 

for transactions to be confirmed and added to the single ledger, which is an important 

feature when more than one participant has permission to propose updates to the ledger. 

We are paying close attention to distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, 

recognizing this may represent the most significant development in many years in 

payments, clearing, and settlement.1   

The Federal Reserve Board has established a working group that is engaged in a 

360-degree analysis of financial innovation across the broad range of our responsibilities, 

drawing on engagement with industry stakeholders and on expertise from across the 

Federal Reserve System, including in supervision, consumer protection, financial stability 

and information technology.  One important area of oversight is the payments system,

where technology changes are viewed through the prism of our responsibilities for 

promoting the safety and efficiency of the payments and settlements systems; supervising 

financial institutions engaged in payments, clearing and settlement; and safeguarding 

financial stability.  We want to maintain public confidence in the payments system, while 

supporting innovation that provides broadly shared benefits to the public over time, 

including through the reduction of unnecessary frictions, costs, and delays.   

 Illustrative Use Cases 

 Let me briefly mention a few of the use cases that we have explored in our 

discussions with industry stakeholders in order to illustrate the potential of distributed 

ledger technologies to improve payments, clearing, and settlement, as well as the 

considerations that are important to us in our assessment of benefits and risks.   

In cross-border payments and trade finance, significantly faster processing and 

reduced costs relative to the long and opaque intermediation chains associated with 

current methods of correspondent banking are promising potential benefits of the 

technology.  Reducing intermediation steps in cross-border payments may help decrease 

time, costs, and counterparty risks and may materially diminish opacity, for instance by 

enabling small businesses or households remitting payments across borders to see the 

associated transfer costs and processing times up front.  In trade finance, where 

document-intensive processes are not fully automated, distributed ledger technology may 

be able to reduce significant costs and speed up processing associated with issuing and 

tracking letters of credit and associated documents. To see the full potential of this 

technology realized for cross-border payments, it will be important to identify and track 


 - 3 - 

identities associated with the transactions, which in itself may be facilitated by the use of 

distributed ledgers, depending on their design.  

In securities markets, the industry is exploring activities ranging from the issuance 

of securities on a distributed ledger, to the clearing and settlement of trades, to tracking 

and administering corporate actions.  For securities clearing and settlement in particular, 

the potential shift to one master record shared “simultaneously” among users of a 

distributed ledger-based system could be compelling.  Sharing one immutable record may 

have the potential to reduce or even eliminate the need for the reconciliation of multiple 

records linked to a single trade among and between dealers and other organizations.  In 

concept, such technology could lead to greater transparency, reduced costs, and faster 

settlement.  Likewise, distributed ledgers may improve collateral management by 

improving the tracking of ownership and transactions.  Nonetheless, as is frequently true 

in the complex arena of payments, clearing, and settlement, we can also expect that 

practical details covering a host of technical, business, and market issues will have an 

important role in determining how new technologies ultimately perform. 

For commodities and derivatives, there are projects to streamline some of the 

more antiquated corners of the markets.  In markets that are heavily paper-based and lack 

any central means for coordination, distributed ledger technology could potentially be 

leveraged to provide coordination that facilitates exchange, clearing, and settlement of 

obligations. 

A related development is the potential coupling of distributed ledger protocols 

with self-execution and possibly self-enforcement of contractual clauses, using so-called 

“smart contracts.”  To take a familiar example, for a corporate bond with a specified par 


 - 4 - 

value, tenor, and coupon payment stream, a smart contract would automatically execute 

payments on the specified schedule to the assigned owner over the life of the bond. 

Although the idea of automating certain aspects of contracts is not new, and banks do 

some of this today, the potential introduction of smart contracts does raise several issues 

for consideration.  For example, what is the legal status of a smart contract, which is 

written in code?  Would consumers and businesses rely on smart contracts to perform 

certain services traditionally done by their banks or other intermediaries?  Could the 

widespread automated interaction of multiple counterparties lead to any unwanted 

dynamics for financial markets?  These and other considerations will be important factors 

in determining the extent of the application of smart contracts. 

Regardless of the application, much of the industry is at a “proof of concept” 

stage of development.  These proofs of concept are often simple, experimental uses of the 

technology on a small scale that help stakeholders understand the potential and 

limitations of the technology for a specific purpose, which in turn typically lead to 

refinements and more developed proofs of concept.  As such, many potential applications 

are in their infancy, and the industry may still be several years away from an application 

that is ready to be fully implemented.  Even so, the industry seems to be making 

announcements daily on new proofs of concept and progress that may lead to pilots, so 

that timeline could accelerate.  In some cases, there have been announcements the 

technology will be used within the next year or two in actual production environments. 

The initial relatively simple proofs of concept must be followed by much more complex 

demonstrations in real-world situations before these technologies can be safely deployed 

in today’s highly interconnected, synchronized, and far-reaching financial markets.

Although many private and inward-facing projects are being explored, the 

industry has also recognized the need to collaborate at early stages of development.  An 

important positive development is that industry participants are actively engaging with 

each other to look for common approaches.  Some groups are creating standards that 

facilitate common platforms to enable greater interoperability of often proprietary 

applications that are built on them and interoperate through application program 

interfaces, or APIs.   

In coming months and years, innovators, investors, and financial practitioners will 

no doubt make important strides in addressing key challenges such as adopting common 

standards, achieving interoperability between and among legacy systems and evolving 

distributed ledgers, improving scalability and computational throughput, and improving 

cryptographic security.  These are positive developments that we will monitor closely.  

Managing Risks 

All of this activity demonstrates that we are in a very innovative period.  The 

industry is eager to get on with adopting the various possibilities that distributed ledger 

technology may bring.  However, established players and, increasingly, new entrants 

understand that there are important guardrails that have been carefully developed over 

many years in the arena of payments, clearing, and settlement.  The safety and soundness 

of financial institutions, safety and efficiency of the payment system, and broader 

financial stability are critical to a healthy financial environment that fosters innovation 

with broad public benefits over the long run.  We expect the private sector to bear 

important responsibility for developing and deploying new financial technologies in a 

safe and sound manner, even as we all seek an innovative and efficient payment system 


 - 6 - 

over the long run.  The deployment of any new financial technology must be undertaken 

with a thorough understanding and management of risks.   

Like many new financial technologies, distributed ledgers could ameliorate or 

exacerbate traditional financial risks.  What matters to us as policymakers and regulators 

is not only whether the migration to a new technological platform increases or reduces 

risks, but also whether risks are rendered more or less opaque, and how they are 

distributed among and between financial intermediaries and end users.  In the payments, 

clearing, and settlement arena, some important risk areas for consideration include 

settlement, operations, and cybersecurity, as well as money laundering and terrorist 

financing.  In managing risks, important considerations include system resiliency and 

governance as well as the role of licensing in ensuring proper oversight.  

In securities settlements, for example, a difference in timing between the delivery 

of securities and the delivery of funds introduces settlement risk between counterparties 

and other institutions involved in this process.  To the extent that distributed ledger 

technologies are designed to supplant the traditional reliance on trusted intermediaries to 

ensure settlement, they will need to reliably demonstrate their ability to mitigate or even 

eliminate settlement risk, especially in cases where the delivery of the securities and the 

associated payment take place on different platforms.   

Traditional payment, clearing, and settlement are subject to operational risk, and it 

is critically important that new technologies operate reliably, securely, and with integrity.  

The daily operation of markets and their clearing and settlement functions are built on 

trust and confidence.  Market participants trust that clearing and settlement functions and 


 - 7 - 

institutions will work properly every day.  Confidence has built over time that when 

market participants trade, accurate and timely clearing and settlement will follow.    

Thus, robust security is an important element of any system.  The distributed 

nature of this new technology, combined with the fact that many connected participants 

can update the shared ledger, means that end-point security is another critical component 

of any successful implementation of the technology.  Adverse actors that can take over a 

participant’s access to the ledger remains a key security concern, as thefts of 

cryptographic keys in Bitcoin continue to demonstrate.  Thus, advances in cryptography 

will remain a key priority to enable widespread adoption of distributed ledger 

technologies, along with systems for securing private keys, the management of access to 

private keys, and differentiated permissions for participants in the system to read and 

write to the ledger.  Recent episodes have illustrated the importance of having protocols 

agreed at the outset to determine whether and under what circumstances to reverse 

transactions once they have been recorded in a distributed master ledger. 

Finally, it will be important that users and administrators of distributed ledger 

technologies can meet their responsibilities to combat money laundering, terrorist 

financing, and other key law enforcement concerns.  Some of the new technologies 

would potentially allow authorized access to certain data records in a much more efficient 

manner than has previously been possible.  For example, distributed ledgers could be 

developed to collect personally identifiable information and country identifiers that 

enable banks to identify and report on suspicious activity.  It will be important that these 

new technological developments and their implementation perform in a safe and sound 

manner that is transparent and satisfies regulatory requirements.

While prevention will remain the preferred approach, realistically, resiliency and 

recovery will also need to be high-priorities.  Indeed, many firms have suggested that the 

distributed data storage concept has the potential to increase the level of resiliency and 

data integrity.  The basic idea is it should be harder to corrupt multiple copies of the same 

data simultaneously such that digital ledgers could reduce the vulnerability associated 

with a single point of failure.  We must press firms and experts to identify the strengths 

and vulnerabilities of this concept, even as we all look for ways to make databases more 

secure and resilient.  In an interesting development, some financial institutions have also 

begun to consider using distributed ledgers to back up critical databases and enable quick 

recovery from potentially virulent cyberattacks.  We will be interested in whether such 

techniques can make new contributions to cybersecurity.   

 Overall, the public needs to have confidence that any system employing 

distributed ledgers will operate properly, particularly in stressed conditions, and know 

that when adverse scenarios do occur, there will be robust management and governance 

to respond effectively.  Recent events, such as thefts from accounts on distributed ledger 

platforms, highlight the challenge that distributed ledgers may have when adverse 

scenarios occur and there is uncertainty around what an appropriate response would be.  

Such uncertainty around management and governance can raise doubts about the integrity 

of a system employing distributed ledgers. 

Traditionally, financial regulators in the United States have been given licensing 

authority as a key way of ensuring that responsibility for managing risks is transparently 

assigned with appropriate oversight.  The development of new business models 


 - 9 - 

associated with evolving financial technologies has raised questions about the 

applicability of existing licenses and their adequacy to new business models.  For 

instance, the Monetary Authority of Singapore recently issued a consultation paper that 

proposes an activity-based payments framework as a way to address the introduction of 

non-traditional payment providers.2  The United States has seen several noteworthy 

recent developments, including the New York State Department of Financial Services’ 

BitLicense, a distributed ledger company, securing Federal Reserve Bank of New York 

approval for participation in the National Settlement Service, and, most recently, 

discussion by the OCC of a limited-purpose charter. 

Ongoing Engagement  

Because of the notable potential of distributed ledger technology, financial 

authorities, both domestic and international, will follow these developments with keen 

interest.  At the Federal Reserve, we expect to publish a research paper later this year that 

summarizes some of the key findings from our industry engagement so far.  Going 

forward, we will continue to deepen our engagement with a range of financial 

institutions, technologists, multi-stakeholder consortia, and academic experts to refine our 

understanding of the new technologies, along with their possibilities and limitations, with 

a particular focus on our responsibilities for the payments system, as well as our 

oversight of financial market intermediaries.  We will also continue to discuss these 

issues with other central banks and authorities around the world.  We will work together
