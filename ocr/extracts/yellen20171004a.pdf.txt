I am very glad to welcome everyone here to this conference sponsored by the 

Federal Reserve System and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors.  Since the first of 

these gatherings five years ago, this research and policy conference has established itself 

as an important event where industry leaders, academics, and supervisors discuss the 

latest research and exchange ideas about promoting a healthy and growing community 

banking industry. 

All of us share an interest in seeing that community banks continue their vital role 

in their customers’ lives and in a strong and stable U.S. financial system.  The Fed has 

been working hard to ensure that its regulation and supervision of banks are tailored 

appropriately to the size, complexity, and role different institutions play in the financial 

system.  For community banks, which by and large avoided the risky business practices 

that contributed to the financial crisis, we have been focused on making sure that much-

needed improvements to regulation and supervision since the crisis are appropriate and 

not unduly burdensome.  

One way we are doing this is through the regulatory review required by the 

Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act, known as EGRPRA.  The 

first step we took, pursuant to EGRPRA, was to listen to industry and others with a stake 

in how community banks are supervised, which was accomplished through soliciting 

written comments and by holding six outreach meetings in 2014 and 2015.  Our 

EGRPRA report, issued in March, was focused on community banks, and it noted steps 

that had already taken place, for example, to simplify Call Report requirements and 

expand the number of firms eligible for less frequent examinations.  Since that report, the 

Board of Governors, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the 


 - 2 - 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, has proposed a rule expanding the number of 

commercial real estate transactions that will no longer require an appraisal, allowing for a 

less detailed evaluation.  And just last week, the Fed, along with other regulators, took a 

significant step to reduce the regulatory burden on community banks and other smaller 

and less complex institutions by proposing to simplify several requirements in the 

regulatory capital rule.   

 We have done this because we have an abiding commitment to consider how our 

decisions affect institutions and the customers they serve.  We are well aware that 

community banks serve communities, businesses, and households that are often 

underserved by larger institutions and offer more extensive and more personalized 

services than are often otherwise available.  We know that community bankers are part of 

the communities they serve, and they are often better able to understand the needs and the 

aspirations of their customers. 

We hope that the research presented at this conference stimulates discussion about 

the leading policy issues facing the industry and supervisors.  As in the past, I see that 

this year’s agenda includes presentations related to several important issues, including the 

effect of supervision on risk-tasking and the effects of greater competition on community 

banks.  I am cheered to see that finance students at the University of Akron remain 

interested enough in community banking to participate in a case-study competition 

related to community banking, and I am pleased that the conference will hear a 

presentation of the winning case study.

In closing, let me thank the conference organizers with the Fed and the 

Conference of State Bank Supervisors, the scholars and others making presentations, and 

all of you for attending.  I hope you have a terrific conference.
