The Near- and Longer-Term Prospects for the U.S. Economy 


Remarks by 
 

Ben S. Bernanke 
 

Chairman 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the 
 

Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Economic Symposium 
 

Jackson Hole, Wyoming 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

August 26, 2011 




Good morning.  As always, thanks are due to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 

City for organizing this conference.  This year’s topic, long-term economic growth, is 

indeed pertinent--as has so often been the case at this symposium in past years.  In 

particular, the financial crisis and the subsequent slow recovery have caused some to 

question whether the United States, notwithstanding its long-term record of vigorous 

economic growth, might not now be facing a prolonged period of stagnation, regardless 

of its public policy choices.  Might not the very slow pace of economic expansion of the 

past few years, not only in the United States but also in a number of other advanced 

economies, morph into something far more long-lasting? 

I can certainly appreciate these concerns and am fully aware of the challenges that 

we face in restoring economic and financial conditions conducive to healthy growth, 

some of which I will comment on today.  With respect to longer-run prospects, however, 

my own view is more optimistic.  As I will discuss, although important problems 

certainly exist, the growth fundamentals of the United States do not appear to have been 

permanently altered by the shocks of the past four years.  It may take some time, but we 

can reasonably expect to see a return to growth rates and employment levels consistent 

with those underlying fundamentals.  In the interim, however, the challenges for U.S. 

economic policymakers are twofold:  first, to help our economy further recover from the 

crisis and the ensuing recession, and second, to do so in a way that will allow the 

economy to realize its longer-term growth potential.  Economic policies should be 

evaluated in light of both of those objectives. 

 This morning I will offer some thoughts on why the pace of recovery in the 

United States has, for the most part, proved disappointing thus far, and I will discuss the 


- 2 - 
 


Federal Reserve’s policy response.  I will then turn briefly to the longer-term prospects of 

our economy and the need for our country’s economic policies to be effective from both a 

shorter-term and longer-term perspective. 

Near-Term Prospects for the Economy and Policy 

In discussing the prospects for the economy and for policy in the near term, it 

bears recalling briefly how we got here.  The financial crisis that gripped global markets 

in 2008 and 2009 was more severe than any since the Great Depression.  Economic 

policymakers around the world saw the mounting risks of a global financial meltdown in 

the fall of 2008 and understood the extraordinarily dire economic consequences that such 

an event could have.  As I have described in previous remarks at this forum, governments 

and central banks worked forcefully and in close coordination to avert the looming 

collapse.  The actions to stabilize the financial system were accompanied, both in the 

United States and abroad, by substantial monetary and fiscal stimulus.  But 

notwithstanding these strong and concerted efforts, severe damage to the global economy 

could not be avoided.  The freezing of credit, the sharp drops in asset prices, dysfunction 

in financial markets, and the resulting blows to confidence sent global production and 

trade into free fall in late 2008 and early 2009. 

We meet here today almost exactly three years since the beginning of the most 

intense phase of the financial crisis and a bit more than two years since the National 

Bureau of Economic Research’s date for the start of the economic recovery.  Where do 

we stand? 

There have been some positive developments over the past few years, particularly 

when considered in the light of economic prospects as viewed at the depth of the crisis.  


- 3 - 
 


Overall, the global economy has seen significant growth, led by the emerging-market 

economies.  In the United States, a cyclical recovery, though a modest one by historical 

standards, is in its ninth quarter.  In the financial sphere, the U.S. banking system is 

generally much healthier now, with banks holding substantially more capital.  Credit 

availability from banks has improved, though it remains tight in categories--such as small 

business lending--in which the balance sheets of potential borrowers remain impaired.  

Companies with access to the public bond markets have had no difficulty obtaining credit 

on favorable terms.  Importantly, structural reform is moving forward in the financial 

sector, with ambitious domestic and international efforts underway to enhance the capital 

and liquidity of banks, especially the most systemically important banks; to improve risk 

management and transparency; to strengthen market infrastructure; and to introduce a 

more systemic, or macroprudential, approach to financial regulation and supervision. 

In the broader economy, manufacturing production in the United States has risen 

nearly 15 percent since its trough, driven substantially by growth in exports.  Indeed, the 

U.S. trade deficit has been notably lower recently than it was before the crisis, reflecting 

in part the improved competitiveness of U.S. goods and services.  Business investment in 

equipment and software has continued to expand, and productivity gains in some 

industries have been impressive, though new data have reduced estimates of overall 

productivity improvement in recent years.  Households also have made some progress in 

repairing their balance sheets--saving more, borrowing less, and reducing their burdens of 

interest payments and debt.  Commodity prices have come off their highs, which will 

reduce the cost pressures facing businesses and help increase household purchasing 

power.     


- 4 - 
 


Notwithstanding these more positive developments, however, it is clear that the 

recovery from the crisis has been much less robust than we had hoped.  From the latest 

comprehensive revisions to the national accounts as well as the most recent estimates of 

growth in the first half of this year, we have learned that the recession was even deeper 

and the recovery even weaker than we had thought; indeed, aggregate output in the 

United States still has not returned to the level that it attained before the crisis.  

Importantly, economic growth has for the most part been at rates insufficient to achieve 

sustained reductions in unemployment, which has recently been fluctuating a bit above 9 

percent.  Temporary factors, including the effects of the run-up in commodity prices on 

consumer and business budgets and the effect of the Japanese disaster on global supply 

chains and production, were part of the reason for the weak performance of the economy 

in the first half of 2011; accordingly, growth in the second half looks likely to improve as 

their influence recedes.  However, the incoming data suggest that other, more persistent 

factors also have been at work. 

Why has the recovery from the crisis been so slow and erratic?  Historically, 

recessions have typically sowed the seeds of their own recoveries as reduced spending on 

investment, housing, and consumer durables generates pent-up demand.  As the business 

cycle bottoms out and confidence returns, this pent-up demand, often augmented by the 

effects of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies, is met through increased production 

and hiring.  Increased production in turn boosts business revenues and household 

incomes and provides further impetus to business and household spending.  Improving 

income prospects and balance sheets also make households and businesses more 

creditworthy, and financial institutions become more willing to lend.  Normally, these 


- 5 - 
 


developments create a virtuous circle of rising incomes and profits, more supportive 

financial and credit conditions, and lower uncertainty, allowing the process of recovery to 

develop momentum. 

These restorative forces are at work today, and they will continue to promote 

recovery over time.  Unfortunately, the recession, besides being extraordinarily severe as 

well as global in scope, was also unusual in being associated with both a very deep slump 

in the housing market and a historic financial crisis.  These two features of the downturn, 

individually and in combination, have acted to slow the natural recovery process.   

Notably, the housing sector has been a significant driver of recovery from most 

recessions in the United States since World War II, but this time--with an overhang of 

distressed and foreclosed properties, tight credit conditions for builders and potential 

homebuyers, and ongoing concerns by both potential borrowers and lenders about 

continued house price declines--the rate of new home construction has remained at less 

than one-third of its pre-crisis level.  The low level of construction has implications not 

only for builders but for providers of a wide range of goods and services related to 

housing and homebuilding.  Moreover, even as tight credit for some borrowers has been 

one of the factors restraining housing recovery, the weakness of the housing sector has in 

turn had adverse effects on financial markets and on the flow of credit.  For example, the 

sharp declines in house prices in some areas have left many homeowners “underwater” 

on their mortgages, creating financial hardship for households and, through their effects 

on rates of mortgage delinquency and default, stress for financial institutions as well.  

Financial pressures on financial institutions and households have contributed, in turn, to 

greater caution in the extension of credit and to slower growth in consumer spending.

I have already noted the central role of the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 in 

sparking the recession.  As I also noted, a great deal has been done and is being done to 

address the causes and effects of the crisis, including a substantial program of financial 

reform, and conditions in the U.S. banking system and financial markets have improved 

significantly overall.  Nevertheless, financial stress has been and continues to be a 

significant drag on the recovery, both here and abroad.  Bouts of sharp volatility and risk 

aversion in markets have recently re-emerged in reaction to concerns about both 

European sovereign debts and developments related to the U.S. fiscal situation, including 

the recent downgrade of the U.S. long-term credit rating by one of the major rating 

agencies and the controversy concerning the raising of the U.S. federal debt ceiling.  It is 

difficult to judge by how much these developments have affected economic activity thus 

far, but there seems little doubt that they have hurt household and business confidence 

and that they pose ongoing risks to growth.  The Federal Reserve continues to monitor 

developments in financial markets and institutions closely and is in frequent contact with 

policymakers in Europe and elsewhere. 

Monetary policy must be responsive to changes in the economy and, in particular, 

to the outlook for growth and inflation.  As I mentioned earlier, the recent data have 

indicated that economic growth during the first half of this year was considerably slower 

than the Federal Open Market Committee had been expecting, and that temporary factors 

can account for only a portion of the economic weakness that we have observed.  

Consequently, although we expect a moderate recovery to continue and indeed to 

strengthen over time, the Committee has marked down its outlook for the likely pace of 

growth over coming quarters.  With commodity prices and other import prices 


- 7 - 
 


moderating and with longer-term inflation expectations remaining stable, we expect 

inflation to settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below the rate of 2 percent, or a bit 

less, that most Committee participants view as being consistent with our dual mandate.   

In light of its current outlook, the Committee recently decided to provide more 

specific forward guidance about its expectations for the future path of the federal funds 

rate.  In particular, in the statement following our meeting earlier this month, we 

indicated that economic conditions--including low rates of resource utilization and a 

subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run--are likely to warrant exceptionally 

low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.  That is, in what the 

Committee judges to be the most likely scenarios for resource utilization and inflation in 

the medium term, the target for the federal funds rate would be held at its current low 

levels for at least two more years.  

In addition to refining our forward guidance, the Federal Reserve has a range of 

tools that could be used to provide additional monetary stimulus.  We discussed the 

relative merits and costs of such tools at our August meeting.  We will continue to 

consider those and other pertinent issues, including of course economic and financial 

developments, at our meeting in September, which has been scheduled for two days (the 

20th and the 21st) instead of one to allow a fuller discussion.  The Committee will 

continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared 

to employ its tools as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context 

of price stability.

Economic Policy and Longer-Term Growth in the United States 

 The financial crisis and its aftermath have posed severe challenges around the 

globe, particularly in the advanced industrial economies.  Thus far I have reviewed some 

of those challenges, offered some diagnoses for the slow economic recovery in the United 

States, and briefly discussed the policy response by the Federal Reserve.  However, this 

conference is focused on longer-run economic growth, and appropriately so, given the 

fundamental importance of long-term growth rates in the determination of living 

standards.  In that spirit, let me turn now to a brief discussion of the longer-run prospects 

for the U.S. economy and the role of economic policy in shaping those prospects. 

 Notwithstanding the severe difficulties we currently face, I do not expect the 

long-run growth potential of the U.S. economy to be materially affected by the crisis and 

the recession if--and I stress if--our country takes the necessary steps to secure that 

outcome.  Over the medium term, housing activity will stabilize and begin to grow again, 

if for no other reason than that ongoing population growth and household formation will 

ultimately demand it.  Good, proactive housing policies could help speed that process.  

Financial markets and institutions have already made considerable progress toward 

normalization, and I anticipate that the financial sector will continue to adapt to ongoing 

reforms while still performing its vital intermediation functions.  Households will 

continue to strengthen their balance sheets, a process that will be sped up considerably if 

the recovery accelerates but that will move forward in any case.  Businesses will continue 

to invest in new capital, adopt new technologies, and build on the productivity gains of 

the past several years.  I have confidence that our European colleagues fully appreciate 

what is at stake in the difficult issues they are now confronting and that, over time, they 


- 9 - 
 


will take all necessary and appropriate steps to address those issues effectively and 

comprehensively.     

This economic healing will take a while, and there may be setbacks along the 

way.  Moreover, we will need to remain alert to risks to the recovery, including financial 

risks.  However, with one possible exception on which I will elaborate in a moment, the 

healing process should not leave major scars.  Notwithstanding the trauma of the crisis 

and the recession, the U.S. economy remains the largest in the world, with a highly 

diverse mix of industries and a degree of international competitiveness that, if anything, 

has improved in recent years.  Our economy retains its traditional advantages of a strong 

market orientation, a robust entrepreneurial culture, and flexible capital and labor 

markets.  And our country remains a technological leader, with many of the world’s 

leading research universities and the highest spending on research and development of 

any nation.  

Of course, the United States faces many growth challenges.  Our population is 

aging, like those of many other advanced economies, and our society will have to adapt 

over time to an older workforce.  Our K-12 educational system, despite considerable 

strengths, poorly serves a substantial portion of our population.  The costs of health care 

in the United States are the highest in the world, without fully commensurate results in 

terms of health outcomes.  But all of these long-term issues were well known before the 

crisis; efforts to address these problems have been ongoing, and these efforts will 

continue and, I hope, intensify. 

 The quality of economic policymaking in the United States will heavily influence 

the nation’s longer-term prospects.  To allow the economy to grow at its full potential, 


- 10 - 
 


policymakers must work to promote macroeconomic and financial stability; adopt 

effective tax, trade, and regulatory policies; foster the development of a skilled 

workforce; encourage productive investment, both private and public; and provide 

appropriate support for research and development and for the adoption of new 

technologies. 

The Federal Reserve has a role in promoting the longer-term performance of the 

economy.  Most importantly, monetary policy that ensures that inflation remains low and 

stable over time contributes to long-run macroeconomic and financial stability.  Low and 

stable inflation improves the functioning of markets, making them more effective at 

allocating resources; and it allows households and businesses to plan for the future 

without having to be unduly concerned with unpredictable movements in the general 

level of prices.  The Federal Reserve also fosters macroeconomic and financial stability 

in its role as a financial regulator, a monitor of overall financial stability, and a liquidity 

provider of last resort. 

Normally, monetary or fiscal policies aimed primarily at promoting a faster pace 

of economic recovery in the near term would not be expected to significantly affect the 

longer-term performance of the economy.  However, current circumstances may be an 

exception to that standard view--the exception to which I alluded earlier.  Our economy is 

suffering today from an extraordinarily high level of long-term unemployment, with 

nearly half of the unemployed having been out of work for more than six months.  Under 

these unusual circumstances, policies that promote a stronger recovery in the near term 

may serve longer-term objectives as well.  In the short term, putting people back to work 

reduces the hardships inflicted by difficult economic times and helps ensure that our 


- 11 - 
 


economy is producing at its full potential rather than leaving productive resources fallow.  

In the longer term, minimizing the duration of unemployment supports a healthy 

economy by avoiding some of the erosion of skills and loss of attachment to the labor 

force that is often associated with long-term unemployment. 

Notwithstanding this observation, which adds urgency to the need to achieve a 

cyclical recovery in employment, most of the economic policies that support robust 

economic growth in the long run are outside the province of the central bank.  We have 

heard a great deal lately about federal fiscal policy in the United States, so I will close 

with some thoughts on that topic, focusing on the role of fiscal policy in promoting 

stability and growth.  

To achieve economic and financial stability, U.S. fiscal policy must be placed on 

a sustainable path that ensures that debt relative to national income is at least stable or, 

preferably, declining over time.  As I have emphasized on previous occasions, without 

significant policy changes, the finances of the federal government will inevitably spiral 

out of control, risking severe economic and financial damage.1  The increasing fiscal 

burden that will be associated with the aging of the population and the ongoing rise in the 

costs of health care make prompt and decisive action in this area all the more critical. 

Although the issue of fiscal sustainability must urgently be addressed, fiscal 

policymakers should not, as a consequence, disregard the fragility of the current 

economic recovery.  Fortunately, the two goals of achieving fiscal sustainability--which 

is the result of responsible policies set in place for the longer term--and avoiding the 

creation of fiscal headwinds for the current recovery are not incompatible.  Acting now to

Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Washington, June 14,

- 12 - 
 


put in place a credible plan for reducing future deficits over the longer term, while being 

attentive to the implications of fiscal choices for the recovery in the near term, can help 

serve both objectives. 

Fiscal policymakers can also promote stronger economic performance through the 

design of tax policies and spending programs.  To the fullest extent possible, our nation’s 

tax and spending policies should increase incentives to work and to save, encourage 

investments in the skills of our workforce, stimulate private capital formation, promote 

research and development, and provide necessary public infrastructure.  We cannot 

expect our economy to grow its way out of our fiscal imbalances, but a more productive 

economy will ease the tradeoffs that we face.   

Finally, and perhaps most challenging, the country would be well served by a 

better process for making fiscal decisions.  The negotiations that took place over the 

summer disrupted financial markets and probably the economy as well, and similar 

events in the future could, over time, seriously jeopardize the willingness of investors 

around the world to hold U.S. financial assets or to make direct investments in job-

creating U.S. businesses.  Although details would have to be negotiated, fiscal 

policymakers could consider developing a more effective process that sets clear and 

transparent budget goals, together with budget mechanisms to establish the credibility of 

those goals.  Of course, formal budget goals and mechanisms do not replace the need for 

fiscal policymakers to make the difficult choices that are needed to put the country’s 

fiscal house in order, which means that public understanding of and support for the goals 

of fiscal policy are crucial. 

Economic policymakers face a range of difficult decisions, relating to both the 


- 13 - 
 


short-run and long-run challenges we face.  I have no doubt, however, that those 

challenges can be met, and that the fundamental strengths of our economy will ultimately 

reassert themselves.  The Federal Reserve will certainly do all that it can to help restore 

high rates of growth and employment in a context of price stability.
