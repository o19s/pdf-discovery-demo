January 3, 2010 


 I’m pleased to participate in this year’s Brimmer Policy Forum.  Governor 

Brimmer and I did not overlap at the Board, but I admired his work from my perch at the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, where I began my career in the System.  And my 

colleagues at the Federal Reserve and I have benefited greatly since then from his 

analytical approach to difficult public policy issues.  This morning I thought it might be 

useful for me to review the course of monetary policy through the crisis and highlight a 

few issues for policy in the future. 

 I’d like to make two important clarifications before I get started:  First, despite the 

title of the Forum, what I am about to discuss is not President Obama’s monetary policy--

it is the Federal Reserve’s.  Fortunately, the Administration has been careful to respect 

the independence of the Federal Reserve in the conduct of monetary policy.  It recognizes 

that the Federal Reserve’s insulation from short-term political pressures is essential for 

fostering achievement of its legislative objectives of stable prices and maximum 

employment over time.  Second, the views you are about to hear are my own and not 

necessarily those of any other member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).   

Monetary Policy Past 

As a prelude to discussing where we are now and issues for the future, I thought it 

would be helpful to summarize the actions that we took over the past two years.  In 

August 2007, we recognized that we were coping with a potentially serious disruption in 

financial markets that could feed back adversely on the economy and job creation.  With 

liquidity in key funding markets drying up and some securitization markets closing down, 

lower policy interest rates alone were not going to be enough to keep financial conditions 


- 2 - 
 

from tightening severely for households and businesses.  In the end, we had to operate on 

multiple fronts to stabilize the financial markets and foster a rebound in the economy.    

 Expanding liquidity facilities.  Our first actions were to ease the access of 

depository institutions to Federal Reserve liquidity.  But, as the crisis worsened, it 

became apparent that these actions would be insufficient.  Securities markets had come to 

play a prominent role in channeling credit in our economy, and severe disruptions outside 

the U.S. banking sector were threatening to reduce economic activity.  To counter the 

financial shocks hitting the economy and support the flow of credit to households and 

businesses, we then needed to extend liquidity support to a range of nonbank institutions 

and to some financial markets.  As we expanded the reach of our liquidity facilities, we 

generally followed the time-honored precepts of central bank behavior in a crisis:  Extend 

credit freely to solvent institutions at a penalty rate against adequate collateral.  By 

making liquidity available more broadly, we were trying to break the vicious spiral of 

uncertainty and fear feeding back on asset values and credit availability, and from there 

to the economy.  We also found we needed to innovate by making liquidity available 

through auctions as well as standing facilities to overcome firms’ reluctance to borrow 

from the Federal Reserve out of concern that the borrowing could be inferred by market 

participants and viewed as an indication of financial weakness.   

 Lowering policy interest rates.  In view of the likelihood that financial 

developments would lead to a weakening of aggregate demand, we began to lower the 

federal funds rate in September 2007, well before any hard evidence had become 

available regarding the magnitude of the restraint that it might impose on economic 

activity.  As it became increasingly evident over the course of 2008 that the financial 


- 3 - 
 

disruptions were sending the U.S. economy into recession, we picked up the pace of 

reductions in our federal funds rate target.  Importantly, our ability to move aggressively 

was enhanced by an environment of already low inflation and stable inflation 

expectations.   

 Buying longer-term assets.  To ease financial conditions further even after our 

policy interest rates had approached zero, we needed to operate directly on longer-term 

segments of the financial markets.  Even though various types of debt securities are 

ordinarily quite substitutable, our purchases of agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed 

securities (MBS), agency debt, and Treasury securities evidently were successful in 

reducing long-term interest rates, partly because during the crisis, private-sector 

participants had a very marked preference for short-term assets.     

 Interest rate guidance.  In this highly unusual situation, and with the normal 

response of monetary policy interest rates constrained by the zero lower bound, we 

consider it especially important that we convey as clearly as possible our policy 

intentions to market participants as they formulate their own expectations for the future 

path of interest rates.  To help in this regard, we have noted in the statements we have 

released at the conclusion of each FOMC meeting our expectation that exceptionally low 

rates will likely be warranted for an extended period.   

 Inflation forecasts and objectives.  Keeping inflation expectations anchored is 

always important but especially so in current circumstances, given the potential effects of 

the unprecedented economic developments and policy actions of the past two years on 

households’ and businesses’ views of the price outlook.  To provide more information to 

the public about our own expectations and objectives, we have extended the horizon of 


- 4 - 
 

the published projections of FOMC participants to five years and have supplemented 

these projections by reporting the long-term inflation rates Committee participants view 

as most consistent with satisfying our dual mandate.   

  Stabilizing systemically important institutions.  In the absence of any other 

governmental agency having the authority to fill the role, we have lent to stabilize several 

systemically important institutions, any one of which--had it failed--would have posed a 

serious threat to the financial system and the economy.  These actions, while necessary, 

were not well suited for a central bank, and we have urged the Congress to enact other 

means of safeguarding financial stability in such circumstances while imposing costs on 

shareholders, management, and, whenever possible, creditors.    

Monetary Policy Present 

The broad suite of monetary, financial, and fiscal policies that have been applied, 

along with the natural resilience of the economy, has led to a marked improvement in 

financial markets and the beginnings of a recovery in economic activity.   

 Financial markets are performing much better now than they were in early 2009.  

Our liquidity facilities, the reduction of uncertainty about the capital and liquidity needs 

of the largest banks after the results of our capital assessment were published in May, and 

the emerging stabilization of the housing and other key sectors of the economy have 

helped a number of financial markets resume more normal functioning.1  As a 

consequence, borrowing from the Federal Reserve has dropped dramatically.  In addition, 

many securitization markets appear to be functioning more normally, partly reflecting the 

support provided by the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility that we

implemented in early 2009 with the support of the Treasury Department.  As we affirmed 

at the December FOMC meeting, the Federal Reserve is in the process of winding down 

and closing most of our extraordinary liquidity windows.   

 Our announcements of purchases of agency MBS, agency debt, and Treasury 

securities helped to lower long-term interest rates and increase the availability of 

mortgages to households and bond financing to businesses.  In addition, our near-zero 

policy rate and the improving economic outlook have induced shifts by private investors 

into longer-term and riskier assets, helping to reverse a portion of the previous spike in 

spreads that occurred as the economy and financial markets deteriorated.  With markets 

improving and the economy expanding, the FOMC has also indicated that it is tapering 

down its purchases of Treasury, MBS, and agency securities.   

 But the cost of credit remains relatively high and its availability relatively limited 

for many borrowers.  Although many long-term interest rates are fairly low, spreads in 

bond markets are somewhat elevated--not surprising, perhaps, as many borrowers are still 

under stress with the unemployment rate quite high and utilization of the capital stock 

still very low.  Some securitization markets continue to be effectively closed or severely 

impaired, including those for larger home mortgages and commercial real estate loans.  

Under these circumstances, some borrowers will be more dependent than in the past on 

banks for credit, but banks are still reluctant and very cautious lenders.  Banks have been 

reducing their book of loans for about a year; in part, this drop reflects weaker demand as 

businesses have cut back on inventories and households have been rebuilding their 

balance sheets by increasing saving.  But the weakness in bank lending also results from 

cutbacks in supply.  Our surveys show that through late 2009, banks continued to tighten 


- 6 - 
 

terms and standards for lending and to raise the rates they charge relative to benchmark 

rates.  I expect bank credit to turn around only slowly as banks rebuild capital and 

become less uncertain about economic prospects.   

 Lingering credit constraints are a key reason why I expect the strengthening in 

economic activity to be gradual and the drop in the unemployment rate to be slow.  Even 

as the impetus from fiscal policy and the inventory cycle wanes later in 2010, however, 

private final demand should be bolstered by further improvements in securities markets 

and the gradual pickup in credit availability from banks.  In addition, spending on houses, 

consumer durables, and business capital equipment should rebound from what appear to 

be exceptionally low levels.  We have already seen some hints of this increase in private 

demand in recent months.  But, understandably, households and businesses and bank 

lenders remain very cautious, and the odds are that the pickup in spending will not be 

very sharp.    

 In an environment of considerable persisting slack in labor and product markets, 

and with productivity having increased substantially in recent quarters, cost and price 

inflation should remain quite subdued.  In the short run, headline inflation will be driven 

importantly by movements in energy and food prices; judging from the structure of 

futures prices, markets are not expecting a further sharp rise in those prices, and thus 

headline inflation should retreat toward core inflation.  Inflation outside of the food and 

energy sectors has been declining slowly, held up by relatively stable inflation 

expectations.  Some further slowing is possible if the economic rebound is as gradual as I 

think it is likely to be.  As I have already noted, keeping inflation expectations anchored 

will be critical for achieving our objectives for prices and output.   


- 7 - 
 

 The FOMC has recently reiterated its expectation that the considerable remaining 

slack in labor and product markets and subdued trends in inflation and inflation 

expectations are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an 

extended period.   

Monetary Policy Future 

The Federal Reserve will face a number of challenges in the conduct of monetary 

policy in the period ahead.  I will discuss two of them:  further exit from our 

extraordinary measures, including the large volume of reserves, our outsized portfolio of 

MBS, agency, and Treasury securities, and our near-zero policy interest rate; and 

evaluating any lessons from the recent experience for the conduct of policy--in particular, 

the potential role of financial stability and asset prices in monetary policy formulation.   

 Exit.  I’m not going to discuss the technical aspects of an exit from our 

extraordinary measures; the Federal Reserve has kept the public apprised of the 

development of our exit tools, and the appropriate use and sequencing of these tools is 

under active discussion by the FOMC.  But I do want to make some general strategic 

points. 

 First, we have no shortage of tools for firming the stance of policy, and we will be 

able to unwind our actions when and as appropriate.  Because we can now pay interest on 

excess reserves, we can raise short-term interest rates even with an extraordinarily large 

volume of reserves in the banking system.  Increasing the rate we offer to banks on 

deposits at the Federal Reserve will put upward pressure on all short-term interest rates.  

In addition, we are developing and testing techniques for draining large volumes of 

reserves through reverse repurchase agreements and through term deposits at the Federal 


- 8 - 
 

Reserve.  And we can sell portions of our holdings of MBS, agency debt, and Treasury 

securities if we determine that doing so is an appropriate approach to tightening financial 

conditions when the time comes.   

 Second, the fiscal situation will not impede timely tightening.  The trajectory of 

the federal budget is a serious economic issue that must be addressed to promote 

sustained and balanced economic growth.  But a large and growing federal deficit will 

not stop the Federal Reserve from exiting from current policies when that’s needed to 

keep prices stable and the economy on a path to sustained high employment.  The 

alternative of letting inflation rise would be inconsistent with our mandate and would 

only cause greater volatility, uncertainty, and inefficiencies that would reduce the growth 

of our economy over time.  Higher interest rates could complicate an already difficult 

fiscal trajectory, and this possibility further underscores the critical importance of 

maintaining Federal Reserve independence from short-term political pressures.   

 Third, because monetary policy typically acts with long lags on the economy and 

price level, the choice of when and how to exit will depend on forecasts.  We will need to 

begin withdrawing extraordinary monetary stimulus well before the economy returns to 

high levels of resource utilization.  The FOMC has been clear that its expectations for the 

stance of monetary policy depend on economic conditions, including resource utilization, 

inflation, and inflation expectations.  Accordingly, the judgment as to when to begin 

initiating steps to withdraw stimulus will depend on the outlook for these variables.   

 Finally, it is well to remember that we are still in uncharted waters.  We do not 

have any recent experience with financial disruptions of the breadth, persistence, and 

consequences of those that we have experienced over the past several years.  And we 


- 9 - 
 

have no experience with most of the sorts of actions the Federal Reserve has taken to 

counter the shock.  The calibration of our exit from these policies is complicated by a 

paucity of evidence on how unconventional policies work.  We will need to be flexible 

and adjust as we gain experience.  

 Financial stability and asset prices.  The past few years have illustrated two 

lessons about the relationship between macroeconomic stability and financial stability.  

First, macroeconomic stability doesn’t guarantee financial stability; indeed, in some 

circumstances, macroeconomic stability may foster financial instability by lulling people 

into complacency about risks.  And second, some shocks to the financial system are so 

substantial, especially when they weaken a large number of intermediaries, that decreases 

in aggregate demand can be large, long lasting, and not quickly or easily remedied by 

conventional monetary policy.   

 Given the heavy costs that have resulted from the financial crisis, the question 

naturally arises as to whether the circumstances that caused the crisis could have been 

avoided.  Among other crucial policy issues, we now need to reexamine, with open 

minds, whether conventional monetary policy should be used in the future to address 

developing financial imbalances as well as the traditional medium-term macroeconomic 

goals of full employment and price stability.  The key question is whether we are likely to 

know enough about asset price misalignments and the likely effects of policy adjustments 

to give us the confidence to deliberately tack away for a time from exclusive pursuit of 

fostering aggregate price stability and high employment.  Obviously preventing situations 

like the current one would be very beneficial.  But against this important objective we 

need to balance the potential costs and uncertainties associated with using monetary 


- 10 - 
 

policy for that purpose, especially in light of the difficulty in judging the appropriateness 

of asset valuations.   

 One type of cost arises because monetary policy is a blunt instrument.  Increases 

in interest rates damp activity across a wide variety of sectors, many of which may not be 

experiencing speculative activity.  Moreover, monetary policy generally operates with 

one instrument--a short-term interest rate--and using it to damp asset price movements 

implies more medium-term variability in output and inflation around their objectives.  

Among other things, inflation expectations could become less well anchored, diminishing 

the ability of the central bank to counter economic fluctuations.  In the current situation, 

with output expected to be well below its potential for some time and inflation likely to 

be under the 2 percent level that many FOMC participants see as desirable over the long 

run, tightening policy to head off a perceived threat of asset price misalignment could be 

expensive in terms of medium-term economic stability.   

Furthermore, small policy adjustments may not be very effective in reining in 

speculative excesses.  Our experience in 1999 and 2005 was that even substantial 

increases in interest rates did not seem to have an effect on dot.com stock speculation in 

the first instance, and housing price increases in the second.  And larger adjustments 

would incur greater incremental costs.  Policy adjustments need to damp speculation; if 

higher rates just weaken output and inflation without damping speculation, the economy 

could be even more vulnerable when the speculative bubble bursts.  We do not have good 

theories or empirical evidence to guide policymakers in their efforts to use short-term 

interest rates to limit financial speculation.    


- 11 - 
 

 For all these reasons, my strong preference would be to use regulation and 

supervision to strengthen the financial system and lean against developing problems.  

Given our current state of knowledge, monetary policy would be used only if imbalances 

were building and regulatory policies were either unavailable or had been shown to be 

ineffective.  But, of course, we should all be working to improve our state of knowledge, 

so as to better understand economic and financial behavior and to further expand the 

range of policy tools that can be employed to enhance macroeconomic performance.  

That objective is one that Governor Brimmer has worked hard to promote.
