Is There a Liquidity Problem Post-Crisis? 




Remarks by 


Stanley Fischer 


Vice Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at 


“Do We Have a Liquidity Problem Post-Crisis?” a conference sponsored by  

the Initiative on Business and Public Policy at the Brookings Institution  


Washington, D.C. 








November 15, 2016 





Market liquidity is the ability to rapidly execute sizable securities transactions at a 

low cost and with a limited price impact.1  The high degree of liquidity in U.S. capital 

markets historically has contributed to the efficient allocation of capital through lower 

costs and a mix of bank- and market-based finance that supports the flexibility of these 

markets.2  Regulatory changes may have altered financial institutions’ incentive to 

provide liquidity, raising concerns brought into sharp relief by several “flash events” over 

the past few years.  At the same time, any changes in observed liquidity are also likely 

accompanied by other related changes--such as in technology--and a more complete 

assessment of these shifts is important when we think about the effects on liquidity of 

changes in financial regulations that were induced by the global financial crisis.3 

This afternoon, I will first review some of the concerns raised by market 

participants and others about market liquidity as well as highlight the challenges 

associated with finding clear evidence that substantiates these concerns.  I will then 

discuss whether potential impairment of liquidity might exacerbate problems related to 

fire sales and leverage.  Finally, I will make the case that any changes in market liquidity 

resulting from regulatory changes should be analyzed in the broader context of the 

overall safety of the financial system.  This perspective naturally emphasizes potential 

tradeoffs between the possibly adverse effect regulations may have on market liquidity 

and their positive effect on the stability of the financial system. 

                                                 
1 This is the definition of market liquidity presented in chapter 2 of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability 

Report, September 2015, p. 50. 
2 In this speech, I am discussing market liquidity, not funding liquidity. 
3 I am grateful to Chiara Scotti and Clara Vega of the Federal Reserve Board staff for their assistance. 

Views expressed are mine and are not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open 

Market Committee.

Market Participants’ Concerns 

1.  Decline in dealers’ inventory 

Market participants have cited a decline in dealers’ inventories as a possible source of 

decreased liquidity.  Figure 1 shows that primary dealers’ inventories of fixed-income 

securities, which are predominantly used for market making, declined sharply after the 

Lehman Brothers failure, from about $1.3 trillion to about $800 billion, and have since 

fallen further to about $700 billion.  The recent decline might be due in part to 

regulations, such as the Volcker rule and the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, aimed at 

making the financial system safer and sounder, as well as to changes firms may have 

made on their own, perhaps in reaction to the experience of the financial crisis.  

Regardless of the causes of the change, market participants have expressed a concern that 

the decline in inventories reflects in part a reduced willingness or capacity of the primary 

dealers to make markets--which may in turn lead to lower liquidity.  However, whether 

markets are in fact less liquid depends on both the degree to which the decrease in 

primary dealers’ inventories affects their willingness to provide liquidity and the extent to 

which nonbank firms such as hedge funds and insurance companies fill any lost market-

making capacity.4   

2.  Decline in trade size and turnover 

Market participants also often cite the decline in average trade size and 

turnover--the volume of trades relative to the total amount of bonds outstanding--as 

                                                 
4 Bessembinder, Jacobsen, Maxwell, and Venkataraman (2016) find that bank dealers are less willing to 

provide liquidity now than in the recent past, while nonbank dealers are more willing.  Duffie (2012) argues 

that the negative effect the Volcker rule may have on market liquidity in the short run may disappear in the 

long run as nonbanks step in to provide liquidity.  Duffie (2012) also mentions that the migration of 

liquidity provision from banks to nonbanks, which are not regulated, may have potentially important 

adverse consequences for financial stability.

evidence of reduced liquidity.  Figure 2 shows that average trade size in the corporate 

bond market has indeed declined since 2006 but has been relatively stable in the past four 

years.  Nevertheless, this decrease may reflect a number of factors, including changes in 

technology or the types and preferences of institutions engaged in trades, so it may not 

indicate a reduction in market liquidity.  Certainly, the length of this trend, roughly a 

decade, seems on its face more consistent with a secular trend such as technological 

change.  Turnover in the corporate bond market has declined as well, though this 

evidence is also not a definitive sign of reduced market liquidity.  The decline in turnover 

is not driven by a reduction in trading volume, but it is the result of a robust growth of the 

denominator, debt outstanding.       

3.  Liquidity during times of stress 

Market participants further express concern about the potential for market 

liquidity to become less resilient during times of stress, when it is needed the most.  

However, evidence on this front is difficult to gather.  Some argue that market liquidity is 

resilient because financial markets appear to have functioned fairly well during recent 

episodes of high market volatility, such as following the Brexit vote or earlier this year, 

when oil prices were low and stock market volatility was high.  Others argue that it is not. 

According to a recent study, the cost of trading distressed corporate bonds appears to be 

higher now than in the recent past.5  Specifically, the authors find that, before the crisis, 

the cost of a $1 million bond transaction increased about 0.7 percent following a 

downgrade, but--after the Volcker rule--the cost following a downgrade rose 2.4 percent.  

                                                 
5 See Bao, O’Hara, and Zhou (2016).

This analysis, however, is limited to episodes of distressed borrowers rather than a 

systemwide stress. 

4.  Flash events 

In addition, recent flash events--such as the sharp movement in Treasury prices on 

October 15, 2014; the rapid rise and decline of the euro-dollar exchange rate on March 

18, 2015; 6 and the swing in sterling on October 7, 2016--have led some to assert that 

market liquidity has become less resilient.   Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of 

New York have argued that spikes in volatility and sudden declines in liquidity have 

become more frequent in both Treasury and equity markets.7  The Commodity Futures 

Trading Commission also points out that flash events are more common now.8  Market 

participants suggest that the rapid growth in high-frequency trading in equity, foreign 

exchange, and U.S. Treasury markets, along with broader concerns about less resilient 

liquidity, potentially explains these flash events.  Nevertheless, a report on the October 

15, 2014 event by the staff of the Treasury Department, Federal Reserve, and market 

regulatory agencies found no single factor that caused the sharp swing in prices.9 

A Broader Review of the Evidence  

1.  Trading costs are low 

Even though flash events appear to be more common, it is certainly too soon to 

declare that a broad reduction in market liquidity has occurred.  Figure 3 plots realized 

bid-ask spreads for investment-grade corporate bonds over time (the black dashed line) 

                                                 
6 See Powell (2015) for a discussion of recent flash events and other changes in the behavior of bond 

prices.  
7 See Adrian and others (2015). 
8 See Massad (2015). 
9 See U.S. Treasury and others (2015).

and speculative-grade corporate bonds (the red solid line).  Prior to the financial crisis, 

the cost of trading corporate bonds was low--on average, bid-ask spreads were about 

1 percent of the price of the bond for investment-grade bonds and about 2 percent for 

speculative-grade bonds.  This measure of trading costs skyrocketed during the financial 

crisis but has returned to the range seen in the few years prior to the crisis.  Alternative 

measures of trading costs, such as price impact measures, which attempt to capture the 

effect of transactions on market prices, follow a similar pattern.   

Transaction costs seem to suggest liquidity has improved.  One caveat, however, 

is that measures of aggregate transaction costs in the corporate bond market may 

underestimate embedded liquidity costs.  In preliminary work, Choi and Huh suggest that 

transactions in which dealers act simply as brokers, rather than as intermediaries that hold 

assets on their balance sheets, could reflect price concessions that dealers make to entice 

counterparties into the other side of a trade so that the dealers will not need to hold the 

traded assets.10  Price concessions, in turn, lower traditional measures of trading costs, 

making trading seem inexpensive, when in reality these concessions are fees the dealers 

pay to some investors for providing liquidity.  Moreover, as dealer inventories have 

declined over the past few years, this downward distortion to aggregate trading cost 

measures may have increased.  To address this problem, Choi and Huh try to isolate 

transactions in which corporate bond investors are looking for liquidity (in other words, 

are looking to trade) and then construct measures of transaction costs for only such 

trades.  The paper’s results are preliminary but appear to suggest transaction costs have 

increased somewhat in recent years.  

                                                 
10 See Choi and Huh (2016).

2.  Trading volume is high 

Another commonly used measure of liquidity is trading volume.  Figure 4 shows 

trading volume in the corporate bond market.  This measure is important because low 

trading volumes may indicate that high transaction costs have deterred investors from 

making trades, a phenomenon that transaction cost measures would clearly miss because 

they are calculated from actual trades.  The trading volumes depicted in the figure show 

no obvious signs of a current problem with market liquidity.  In 2006, investors traded an 

average of $12 billion a day.  During the height of the financial crisis, trading volume 

decreased to $8 billion a day, but, by 2009, volumes appeared to have fully recovered.  

Today trading volumes are at about $19 billion a day.  On balance, the evidence 

presented in these two figures seems to suggest that market liquidity has not deteriorated 

in recent years--subject, of course, to the caveat I just discussed about the possibility that 

our measures of bid-ask spreads could be distorted by the increasing role of investors as 

suppliers rather than demanders of liquidity.11 

As an aside, the market liquidity figures shown are only for the corporate bond 

market, but we see similar patterns in the equity and Treasury markets.12  That is, we do 

not find convincing evidence that liquidity has markedly declined in those markets.   

Policy Issues Related to Market Liquidity 

While the evidence for changes in market liquidity does not point clearly to a 

reduction, I have highlighted some recent research that indicates the possibility that 

market liquidity has fallen.  To date, observed changes in liquidity do not suggest that 

                                                 
11 Trebbi and Xiao (2015) analyze multiple corporate bond liquidity measures and conclude that there is no 

evidence of deterioration in liquidity due to regulation. 
12 Secured funding spreads have increased, suggesting higher intermediation costs in the repo (repurchase 

agreement) market.

shifts in liquidity are having a notable effect on the cost of trading.  Nonetheless, the 

potential for liquidity to evaporate in times of stress deserves careful scrutiny--along with 

broader risks to financial stability associated with changes in markets. 

One area where policy concerns have arisen is related to the potential for fire sales 

in bond markets, which could compound the risks associated with leverage in the 

financial sector.  Bond markets have grown considerably, and market-based finance has 

intensified over the past years, making market liquidity even more important.13  In 

addition, mutual funds that offer daily redemption rights have grown relative to the size 

of corporate bond markets. As shown in figure 5, assets under management in 

investment-grade and high-yield corporate bond mutual funds (the solid blue area) have 

hovered around 25 to 30 percent of the amount of outstanding corporate bonds in recent 

years, up from about 15 percent before the crisis.i   

Reduced market liquidity might exacerbate fire sale risks from leverage at 

financial institutions or from first-mover advantage at mutual funds.  Leveraged 

institutions are more sensitive to changes in asset prices.  Adverse movements in asset 

prices, margin calls, and higher haircuts may force them to sell assets to obtain cash and 

delever, affecting other market participants through declining asset prices and increased 

margin calls.   

In addition, leverage may closely interact with liquidity risk at mutual funds.  

Open-end mutual funds are characterized by the so-called first-mover advantage:  

Investors can redeem daily from the funds that hold assets that are less liquid, while 

                                                 
13

 A market-based system is one where securities markets share center stage with banks in allocating 

capital, in contrast to a bank-based system, where banks play a leading role.

liquidation costs are borne by investors remaining in the fund.  If a decline in bond prices 

leads to sizable fund withdrawals, the first-mover advantage could accelerate 

redemptions and second-round price declines.  In addition, investors may perceive 

leveraged funds that experience stress as riskier, possibly becoming more inclined to 

redeem from these funds.  This situation could be worse than in the past if market 

liquidity deteriorates and dealers are less willing to buy and hold bonds in inventory to 

cushion the price decline induced by fire sales.  However, thanks to recent regulation and 

supervisory changes, including higher capital requirements and stress tests, leverage at 

the largest intermediaries is much reduced relative to pre-crisis norms--and, as a result, 

vulnerabilities from potential fire sale risks are less significant.  From this perspective, a 

small reduction in liquidity from regulatory changes--even if present, which is not 

obvious--may be a reasonable price to pay for greater safety.  I will now place changes in 

liquidity into the broader context of financial stability.    

Tradeoff between Liquidity and Regulations to Achieve a Safer Financial System 

It is possible that regulations aimed at correcting vulnerabilities in the financial 

system--like the Supplementary Leverage Ratio, together with other factors--have altered 

the business model of dealer firms and, thus, liquidity.  While the evidence for a 

reduction in market liquidity is far from clear, let us for the moment accept this 

possibility and consider the potential effects on financial stability.   

Regulatory changes, even those that may have reduced market liquidity, likely 

have enhanced financial stability on balance.  Recent evidence indeed points in favor of 

enhanced financial stability.  Regulatory capital ratios for banks and insurance companies 

remain high, which, as previously mentioned, would mitigate fire sales and their effect on 


 - 9 - 

the solvency and functioning of these institutions.  Leverage at intermediaries is much 

reduced relative to pre-crisis norms, and gross leverage at hedge funds, based on the 

partial information available, has not changed much in recent years.  Research from 

economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that the decline in leverage, 

among other factors, has substantially reduced potential fire sale externalities in the 

banking and broker-dealer sectors.14  Thus, the regulatory changes appear to be having a 

positive effect on financial system stability, and these benefits may outweigh the 

potential costs of a possible reduction in liquidity.  

Regulatory changes are in train for the asset management industry, whose 

vulnerabilities have been under examination by the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

and the Financial Stability Board.15  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has 

recently approved rules to modernize and enhance the reporting and disclosure of 

information by registered investment companies and to enhance liquidity risk 

management by open-end funds, including mutual funds and certain exchange-traded 

funds.16  The SEC has also proposed rules that would put new limits on registered 

funds’ gross notional derivative exposures, enhance the requirements for asset 

segregation in derivatives transactions, and include new risk-management requirements 

for the use of derivatives.17

Conclusion 

Overall, liquidity is  adequate by most measures, in most markets, and most of the 

time.18  Bid-ask spreads and price-impact measures point toward liquidity that is good by 

historical standards, and we have not observed declines in market liquidity in recent 

episodes of high market volatility.  Nevertheless, the market structure is changing, and 

trades in certain situations and in certain market segments might have become more 

costly.  Also, flash events may be more frequent today, and the dynamics of a system 

with frequent flash events are likely to become complicated.  Moreover, some regulatory 

changes are only now being phased in.  In light of these changes and the evolving 

structure of financial markets, it will be important to monitor and continue to analyze the 

state of market liquidity.  As we monitor, we should continue to emphasize how the 

evolution of market liquidity interacts with broader changes to affect the efficient 

allocation of capital and financial stability.  And we should always bear in mind the 

possibility that new financial developments could change the dynamics of market 

responses to unanticipated economic developments.

i Update December 21, 2016:  The original version of this speech, referring to figure 5, 

stated that “In addition, mutual funds that offer daily redemption rights hold a greater 

share of bonds than investors who buy and hold. As shown in figure 5, the share of 

investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds held at mutual funds (the solid blue 

area) has hovered around 25 to 30 percent in recent years, up from about 15 percent 

before the crisis.”  The figure shows assets under management by corporate bond mutual 

funds, not such funds’ holdings of corporate bonds, relative to outstanding corporate 

bonds.  The text has been revised to correctly describe the figure.
