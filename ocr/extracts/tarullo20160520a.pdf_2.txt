 It is a pleasure to be here with you this morning to discuss the statutory role of the 

Federal Reserve in supervising and regulating insurance firms.  Since we inherited from the 

Office of Thrift Supervision the oversight of savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) that 

contain insurance companies, we have looked at our role as complementing the role you--as 

insurance regulators--play.  We value the interaction we have had with state insurance 

commissioners on policy matters and are pleased with the growth of ongoing, regularized 

cooperation in supervising the firms over which we both have oversight authority.  Personally, I 

have profited enormously from the assistance provided by the staff of the National Association 

of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) as I delved into the history and practice of capital 

regulation of insurance companies. 

 Today I would like to begin by describing how I view the Federal Reserve’s role in 

insurance regulation and supervision--both what it is and what it is not.  As I think you will find, 

we have tried to occupy that role in a way that is closely grounded in the duties that Congress has 

given us.  Then I will present current thinking on a topic that I know has occasioned great 

interest--the Federal Reserve’s plans for adopting capital requirements for the insurance firms 

over which we now have statutory responsibilities. 

The Federal Reserve’s Role in Insurance Regulation and Supervision 

The U.S. insurance industry has historically been, and remains, a significant part of the 

U.S. economy.  For the industry across all sectors, written premiums last year totaled nearly 

$2 trillion and earned premiums totaled nearly $1.8 trillion, representing increases from 2014 of 

approximately 6 percent and 4 percent, respectively.1  This represents over 7 percent of U.S.
