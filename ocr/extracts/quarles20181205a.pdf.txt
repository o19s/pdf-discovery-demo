It’s a pleasure to be here at Stanford, an honor to be invited to speak by SIEPR and the 

Bill Lane Center--two institutions for which I have long had fondness and respect--and a great 

luxury to have the chance to talk for an hour with a group of people who share my love for a part 

of the world we call the West.  Most of my day job enmeshes me, of necessity, in either broad 

systemic questions of global financial stability or the impossibly arcane minutiae of our 

convoluted and labyrinthine financial regulatory system.  Both of those are perfectly worthy 

occupations but inescapably require a relentlessly global outlook.  Yet my first intellectual 

passion as a very young man was for the history and life of a specific part of the world--the 

Western United States, as place and idea.  Your own presence here in the audience suggests that 

many of you have been moved at some point in your life, as I have been, by the words of 

Wallace Stegner: 

If there is such a thing as being conditioned by climate and geography, and I think there 
is, it is the West that has conditioned me.  It has the forms and lights and colors that I 
respond to in nature and in art.  If there is a western speech, I speak it; if there is a 
western character or personality, I am some variant of it; if there is a western culture in 
the small-c, anthropological sense, I have not escaped it.1 
 
So, that is why I say it is a pleasure and an honor but most especially a luxury for me to 

speak to an audience that shares my concern for and love of the West on the topic of how the 

preoccupations of my day job--banking and finance--affect this particular part of the world.  We 

all know that throughout the history of the West, banking and finance have played an important 

role as vital infrastructure for the economy.  That remains true today, although it is often 

overlooked in the traditional litany of issues critical to the West.  A strong banking industry is 

necessary for households and businesses to engage in the spending, saving, and investment that 

constitute economic activity, and one of the purposes of financial regulation is to ensure that

banks continue to be able to serve this purpose.  So it is my plan today to talk about the economy 

of the West and link the recent and future performance of the western economy to the central and 

supportive role banks play as vital infrastructure in their communities. 

Defining the West 

Let’s start by defining our terms. What do we mean by the West?  Before this audience, I 

approach this question with respect and a little caution, because I know that in a broad sense, it is 

what the Center for the American West has been addressing since its founding.  That aside, it 

makes sense to use a definition, as the center often does, that includes parts of states in the 

middle of the country whose economies, heavily dependent on natural resources, ranching, and 

farming, more closely resemble Montana and New Mexico than they do states on the Eastern 

seaboard.   

Nevertheless, for the purposes of these remarks, I am going to use a less expansive 

definition comprising the 13 westernmost states.  I do so partly because this is a common 

definition of the West, and because it is the one used by the U.S. Census Bureau in dividing the 

country into four regions and this has helped me gather data for this speech more readily. (Figure 

1) 

The first thing to mention that distinguishes the West from the rest of the country is 

apparent on this map--land area.  The West is large and would appear even larger of course, if it 

weren’t necessary to shrink the vastness of Alaska to fit on one page.  Even using my more 

modest definition, the West still represents half of the land area of the United States.  This is 

important in this context because of one theme I will be exploring today, which is the economy 

of the rural West and the banking services available there.

As this map should make plain, when we talk about rural America, to a significant extent 

we are talking about the rural West.  Another way to put it is that while the West is half of the 

United States geographically, it is only a quarter of its population.2  Eight of the 13 states in our 

definition of the West are among the dozen in the nation with the lowest population density.3  

Even after subtracting the large share of unpopulated government-owned land in the West, the 

overwhelming majority of the West is rural. 

Yet it is also true that, as most of you know, the West is the most urban region of the 

country.  Five of the 15 largest metro areas in the United States are located in the West, and 90 

percent of the entire region’s population lives in cities, compared to 81 percent of the country as 

a whole. 4,5  Nevada and Utah are among the least densely populated states, but 90 percent or 

more of their residents live in cities.  Like the rest of the country, the West is urbanizing.  I will 

return to the differences between urban and rural areas, but first, let’s look at the economy of the 

West. 

The Economy of the West: From Boom to Boom 

The West accounts for 25 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, almost exactly the 

share of the U.S. population in the West.  This isn’t entirely a coincidence, because population 

relates to labor supply, which is one determinant of economic output.  I mention this because it is

also true that the change in population over time has a bearing on the economic health of 

communities and regions, and is part of the story for economic growth in the western United 

States. 

In recent years, that story has been a very positive one.  The U.S. economy is strong, and 

the western economy is especially strong.  While we don’t have state or regional numbers for 

this year, from 2015 through 2017, GDP, after adjusting for inflation, grew two to nearly three 

times as fast in the West as in the rest of the United States.  Since the Great Recession ended in 

2010, real GDP has grown twice as fast in the West as in the Northeast, about 50 percent faster 

than in the Midwest, and a third faster than in the South.6    

But there is another distinction to the western economy, one that many in this audience 

know well, that brings these high-flying results down to earth.  While the good times are 

typically very good in the West, the bad times are usually pretty bad, and that was certainly true 

during the Great Recession.  From 2008 through 2010, the western economy contracted four 

times as much as the average for all of the United States.  The same is true for per capita 

personal income, which contracted more sharply in the West than elsewhere, as job losses in the 

western region during the recession were worse than elsewhere.  

Taking a longer perspective, however, even with the booms and the busts that have 

characterized the West for upwards of 200 years, the West is still the fastest growing region of 

the United States.  Since 2000, real GDP has grown twice as fast in the West as in the Northeast 

and Midwest, and about 30 percent faster than in the South.  Since 1988, the numbers are 

roughly the same.  Per capita personal income grew faster in the West during good years,

outweighing the sharper losses during the recession and since 2000 has grown about 20 percent 

faster in the West than in the rest of the country.  

This picture of the West leading the nation in economic growth is also reflected in 

population, a key factor in that growth.  From 2010 to 2017, the population of the West increased 

7.4 percent, compared to 5.3 percent for the nation.7  One might guess that this strong growth is 

primarily in cities, and in fact reflects the drain of population from smaller towns that is reported 

to be happening all over the United States.  But in fact, population gains in the West are quite 

well balanced between cities and towns, and smaller towns are doing better in the West than 

elsewhere in holding and even increasing their populations.   

In the cities of the West, those communities of 50,000 or more, the population grew 7.8 

percent from 2010 to 2017, eclipsed by the 10 percent growth in southern cities but well above 

the 2 percent to 3 percent increase in the cities of the Northeast and Midwest.8  At the same time, 

the West led the other regions of the United States in growth for towns and cities from 10,000 to 

50,000 in size, and likewise for towns between 5,000 and 10,000.    

Now let’s look at small towns, those with 5,000 or fewer residents.  It is this cohort of 

towns and their people that to my mind is really the essence of rural America.  There is a 

widespread impression that small towns all over America are shrinking and that population is 

shifting to larger towns and cities, and that is the story we can see in much of the regional data.  

From 2010 to 2017, the average small town shrank by 2 percent in the Northeast, by 1.4 percent 

in the Midwest, and only grew 1.3 percent in the South, while larger towns and cities grew 

substantially faster there and elsewhere.

What about the West, where urbanization is happening more quickly than anywhere else? 

In fact, the average western small town grew 7.8 percent in those seven years, which is roughly 

the same healthy pace of growth registered in western towns and cities from the smallest to the 

largest.   

With a nod to Mark Twain, the message here is that reports of the death of small towns, 

at least in the West, have been greatly exaggerated.  I don’t mean to minimize the challenges 

small towns face, because they are considerable, or suggest that western small towns are immune 

to them, because they certainly are not.  But the more positive message I come away with here is 

that a rising tide of prosperity in the West seems to be lifting communities large and small, and 

that the many instances of small towns in decline that we all hear about are counterbalanced by 

other small towns growing healthily.  Another lesson is that population growth and the attendant 

economic growth in the West is not zero sum, and that small towns can still grow healthily while 

the metropolises of the West continue to attract people, partly from outside the region.  I will 

return to the issue of how the economies of the urban and rural West differ, but the backdrop is 

that population data are promising for both. 

Banking in the West 

Now that I have outlined how the economy of the West relates to that of the rest of the 

United States, let me do the same for banking in the West.  There is a lot to this topic, but my 

focus is banking as it is experienced at the retail level by households and small- and medium-

sized businesses.  Again, I use the Census Bureau’s list of 13 states to define the West, and for a 

simpler comparison, and in honor of Frank Church, I will refer to the other 37 states as “eastern” 

even though they cover several regions.  Some of you are old enough to remember Frank 

Church, the U.S. Senator from Idaho--a Stanford grad and hero of mine when I was a teenager.

When he ran for president in 1976 and had some success in the primaries, he was challenged by 

the press that said his victories were limited to the West, and he replied “What do you mean I 

can’t win an eastern state?  I won Nebraska!” 

One dimension to how households and most businesses experience banking is the number 

of banks competing for their services, and one difference between the West and the East is that 

the West has fewer banks, even if we count them on a per capita basis.9  In addition, banks in the 

West tend to be larger. One reason for the disparity in the average number and size of banks is 

that historically, a larger share of western states allowed statewide branching or had relatively 

limited branching restrictions, leading to the development of fewer and larger banks.10   

In metropolitan areas of the West, the average number of banks was 23 in 2017, 

compared to 27 in eastern metro areas.   In rural counties of the West, customers had access to an 

average of 4.6 banks in 2017, compared to 5.4 banks in the East.  In both urban and rural areas, 

in both the East and the West, the average number of banks increased in the years leading up to 

the financial crisis but has been declining since then.  While there is certainly more to say about 

banking services in cities, I want to focus on rural areas for the moment.  Over the last 20 years, 

rural westerners have consistently had access to something like 20 percent fewer banks than rural 

easterners, which amounts to about one less bank per rural county.   That may not sound like 

much, but that one less bank, on average, can make a big difference to the households and small 

businesses inhabiting those rural counties.

the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  
 
10 Even though state banking restrictions were eliminated in most states decades ago, the differences in the number 
of banks across states have persisted.

In any community, access to credit is essential for economic growth.  In any community, 

but especially in rural communities, small businesses are key drivers of growth.  Small 

businesses heavily rely on banks for funding, and community banks, those with less than $10 

billion in assets, account for a disproportionate share of bank lending to small businesses. 

But across the country, the number of community banks has fallen by half over the past 

20 years, mostly due to consolidation.  This fall has been slightly larger in the West than the 

East, but the reason I highlight this trend is that I believe it has significant consequences for rural 

communities in the West.  The reason returns me to that map I showed earlier.  The West is vast, 

and many rural communities in the West must deal with the challenges of isolation from larger 

towns and cities that few communities in the East face.  Rural westerners have access to far 

fewer banks overall than rural easterners, but that understates the disparity when some western 

counties are the size of Maryland or Massachusetts and many are more than a hundred miles 

across, so that access to a limited number of banks can be difficult or out of reach. 

To provide some perspective on this challenge, let me share what westerners in one small 

town have to say about their access to banking services.  This account is culled from a series of 

public meetings that the Federal Reserve is convening in communities all around the country, in 

support of our responsibilities overseeing community banks and promoting community 

development. 

Not quite a month ago, we held one such session in my home state of Utah, in the town of 

Green River, population 940, located on the eastern side of the state.  It is just off an isolated 

stretch of interstate, and its economy depends on those passersby and tourism related to outdoor 

recreation.  In 2014, Green River lost its only bank, and around that time, banks closed in several 

nearby communities.  As a result, most residents of Green River who need banking services must 


- 9 - 
 

drive the 52 miles to Moab, Utah.  This loss has had a profound effect on households and 

businesses, essentially turning back the clock in Green River by decades, as far as its access to 

the banking system.  Business owners say their work days have been curtailed by the need to 

drive two or three times a week to Moab to obtain change and make deposits.  Businesses have 

become banks for many residents, agreeing to cash their checks.  Because of this new service to 

residents, and the long distance to a real bank, retail businesses say they are carrying much larger 

amounts of cash, which has heightened security concerns and prompted some merchants to 

invest in new safes.  Security is also a concern for residents who no longer have access to safety 

deposit boxes for valuables and important papers.   

Faster and more efficient electronic payments hold some promise to bridge these gaps, 

eventually, and the Federal Reserve is working hard on this and making significant progress.  

But one thing that technology cannot do is replace the knowledge and perspective of a local 

banker who is part of the community.  Relationship-based lending that is the hallmark of 

community banking can stem losses during downturns, since community banks may be able to 

work with borrowers to avoid losses.  Research has shown that small business lending at smaller 

banks declined less severely than at large banks during the last recession. 

Community banks face considerable competition.  One of the reasons that community 

banks continue to succeed in many places is their understanding of their customers’ needs and 

opportunities to invest in families and businesses.  The loss of this relationship, for a community, 

means that needs will go unmet, and opportunities will be lost.  

In some communities, of course, this may be unavoidable, if a town has lost a major 

employer and has no new industry or plan to replace the jobs lost.  But let me remind you of the 

very encouraging data I cited on the growth of small towns in the West.  Overall, rural 


- 10 - 
 

communities are growing at a healthy pace, and growing communities need banks.  It is my hope 

that the opportunity for the future that this population growth suggests will support the local 

banks that communities need to thrive.  

A significant part of the Federal Reserve’s recent regulatory focus has been aimed at 

streamlining regulations and reducing the regulatory burden on smaller and regional banks.   

The Fed, along with the other banking agencies, recently proposed a community bank 

leverage ratio that is designed to simplify significantly the standards banks must abide by for 

holding capital.11  As a result, qualifying community banks will only need to calculate and meet 

a single measure of capital adequacy, rather than multiple measures.  We have also proposed a 

reduction in the burden of reporting requirements for community banks, and expect soon to 

propose an exemption for community banks to the Volcker rule.12  For a subset of the smallest 

banks--those with less than $5 billion in total assets--we have also lengthened the amount of time 

between supervisory examinations and expanded eligibility of small bank holding companies 

that qualify for an exemption to the Federal Reserve’s capital rules, a policy that was designed to 

promote local ownership of small banks and to help maintain banks in rural areas.13 

Most recently, the Federal Reserve spearheaded a proposal to tailor regulation that 

applies to firms that are larger than community banks, but the potential failure of which generally

qualifying community banking organizations,” news releases, November 21, 2018.

the applicability of the Board’s small bank holding company policy statement,” news release, August 28, 2018.  Of 
course, while the holding companies of community banks may be eligible for an exemption from capital rules, the 
subsidiary banks are still subject to capital requirements.

does not pose risks to the financial system.14  These are firms with between $100 billion and 

$250 billion in total assets.  Those changes are designed to reduce unnecessary regulatory 

burdens on specific institutions without any loss of resiliency for the financial system. 

By these steps, I believe the Federal Reserve is helping community banks remain 

competitive and play the central role they have long played as vital infrastructure for rural 

communities.  The future of community banks in these communities is one reason that I’m 

optimistic about the economic prospects of small towns in the West, which continue to grow 

even as the region and the nation overall becomes more urban.  That’s a good thing, because 

small towns, and especially their values, have long helped define the West, and I hope will 

continue to do so.
