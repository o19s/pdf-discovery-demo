Good afternoon. I am delighted to be here in Denver for a few days to visit with 

community leaders working to support affordable housing, workforce development, and 

small businesses across the Mile High City.  So far, I have had a chance to hear firsthand 

about the housing affordability challenges facing many Denver families, which are 

requiring some families to make difficult choices between paying rent and paying for 

other necessities, and the associated challenges of homelessness.  I have also had the 

opportunity to see the incredible work underway in Denver to ensure that individuals and 

families in need have access to safe, affordable shelter and the healthcare and case 

management services they need to get back on their feet.  

Not only is Denver’s approach to service delivery a national model, but your use 

of Social Impact Bonds to fund those programs is also at the forefront of innovation in 

the community development sector.  I can see there is a lot of pride in what you are 

accomplishing locally, and I look forward to seeing more groundbreaking work during 

the remainder of my time here. 

Every few months, I try to make a visit such as this one to better understand how 

different communities across the country are experiencing the economy.  Promoting 

community development is one of the key purposes and functions of the Federal Reserve, 

and it requires that we have a strong understanding of the impacts of financial policies 

and practices in communities in all of our Districts.1   

I have heard about the important role the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 

has played in strengthening community investment, so I am happy to have this 

opportunity to learn about your perspectives, as bankers here in Denver, on opportunities

for further improvement.  This roundtable is the first of several that the Federal Reserve 

System will host in the next several months to hear directly from bankers, community 

members, practitioners, researchers, and others about improving the CRA’s effectiveness 

in making credit available to lower-income areas.  We are inviting representatives of 

other banking regulatory agencies to join us so that we can all benefit from learning from 

different local experiences with the CRA.  Our hosts at the Reserve Banks will be taking 

notes, and a summary of the findings from this outreach initiative will be made public.  

Before we get started, I want to say a few words about the interagency process for 

revising CRA regulations and the Federal Reserve’s priorities.  As you know, the Office 

of the Comptroller of the Currency recently published an Advance Notice of Proposed 

Rulemaking (ANPR) to solicit public comment on a variety of questions related to 

revising CRA regulations.  Comments are due by November 19.   

Last week, the Board heard from members of the Fed’s Community Advisory 

Council that there may be some confusion about commenting on the ANPR because it 

was not published on an interagency basis.  Even though the Federal Reserve did not join 

in the publication of the ANPR, we will be reading the comment letters in anticipation of 

working with the Comptroller and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on a joint 

proposal.  We understand the importance of having the agencies work toward one set of 

CRA regulations that are clear and consistently applied and will do everything we can to 

make that possible.  CRA regulations are complicated, and the regulators will benefit 

from perspectives from a variety of channels, so I encourage you all to submit comments.  

The CRA is too important to the financial well-being of communities across this country 

for banks and community members to disengage in any part of this process.

The CRA has not only made more credit available in lower-income areas, but it 

has also helped to create a valuable community and economic development 

infrastructure.  Revising the regulations will require careful consideration in order to 

strengthen that infrastructure.  All of the agencies share the stated purpose of revising the 

regulations, which is to promote more, not less, CRA activity in underserved areas, as the 

Comptroller stated in recent testimony.2  Properly balancing the goals of simplifying and 

clarifying the regulations, with the goal of promoting more CRA activity through 

stronger local community engagement, will require careful consideration.  

I want to emphasize the Board’s commitment to regulatory revisions that 

strengthen the CRA’s purpose, which is to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs 

of the communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods.  In that regard, there are a few principles that will guide our work.   

First, we should update the area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA 

activities while retaining the core focus on place.  I look forward to hearing your 

suggestions about how we can broaden our evaluation of banks’ CRA performances to 

take into account the technological advances that have made it possible for banks to serve 

customers remotely, while retaining the focus on local credit needs that vary from place 

to place.  The Federal Reserve’s research, surveys, and outreach point to an economy that 

is very strong on an aggregate level but significantly more varied at the community level, 

with many neighborhoods still struggling.   

Second, the CRA regulations should be tailored to banks of different sizes and 

business models.  Currently, the evaluation methods are tailored to banks of different

sizes and business models.  We should consider whether assessment areas also should be 

tailored to the business models employed by banks. 

Third, any redesign of CRA regulations should be done with the goal of 

encouraging banks to seek out opportunities in underserved areas.  This is not simply a 

question of expanding a bank’s assessment area, but of providing more incentives for 

banks to more effectively address the needs in neighborhoods that they may already be 

serving with branches.  For example, there are concerns that distortions may lead some 

areas to become credit hot spots, while others become credit deserts.  Investments, such 

as Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, are in such high demand in some areas that there is 

little return on investment, while it is difficult to find investors in other areas.  We believe 

that it is important for revisions to CRA regulations to address this type of market 

distortion to promote more lending and investment in smaller markets within a bank’s 

footprint. 

Fourth, the Federal Reserve is interested in promoting greater consistency and 

predictability in CRA evaluations and ratings.  We see the value of clearer definitions and 

metrics that use publicly available information to identify local credit needs and 

opportunities.   

Finally, it is important to recognize that the CRA is one of several mutually 

reinforcing laws.  The central thrust of the CRA is to encourage banks to ensure that all 

creditworthy borrowers have fair access to credit.  For banks to be successful in meeting 

the credit needs of their entire community, it has long been recognized that they must 

guard against discriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices.

With these principles in mind, I look forward to hearing your ideas on how we 

can make the CRA a more effective tool for bringing credit and capital to underserved 

communities.
