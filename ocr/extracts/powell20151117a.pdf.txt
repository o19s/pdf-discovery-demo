Thank you for inviting me to speak today.1  I attended The Clearing House 

annual meeting in 2013 and spoke about financial market infrastructure reform.    

Two years have passed, and this is a good opportunity to take stock.  I’ll start by 

reviewing the progress made in strengthening central counterparty (or CCP) 

clearing, and then offer some thoughts on expanded central clearing for repurchase 

agreement (or repo) markets--an area of significant current interest. 

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, the over-the-counter (OTC) 

derivatives market experienced rapid growth and an underappreciated buildup of 

risk.  The huge losses suffered by the American International Group (AIG) on its 

derivatives positions and the lack of transparency about the exposures of AIG’s 

counterparties were major accelerants to the financial panic that reached its acute 

phase in September 2008.  In response, in 2009 the Group of Twenty nations 

committed to moving standardized derivatives to central clearing, and to requiring 

posting of margin for derivatives that are not centrally cleared.2  

I am a believer in the potential benefits of central clearing under the right 

circumstances.  But central clearing is not a panacea.  Charts similar to that in 

Figure 1 are often used to illustrate the netting of exposures and simplification that

the Federal Open Market Committee.

central clearing can bring to an OTC market.  The tangled and highly opaque 

picture of a purely bilateral market is replaced by the neat hub-and-spoke network 

in which a CCP is buyer to every seller, and seller to every buyer, allowing netting 

and greater transparency for participants and regulators alike.  Of course, reality is 

not so elegant, as Figure 2 illustrates.  There are multiple CCPs, even within 

product classes, and major dealers act as clearing members across a broad network 

of CCPs.  Clearing members also perform a range of services for CCPs, including 

custody, liquidity provision, and settlement.  By design, increased central clearing 

will concentrate risks in CCPs; it is essential that, as these risks accumulate, the 

CCPs build up their ability to manage them.  It is often noted that CCPs made it 

through the recent financial crisis without direct government assistance.  But many 

of their major clearing members did receive such assistance.  CCPs must now plan 

for a world in which these large firms will fail and be resolved without government 

support.  

Recognizing the importance of strengthening our financial market 

infrastructure, the regulatory community has clarified and significantly raised 

expectations for CCPs and all key financial market infrastructures (FMIs or market 

infrastructures).  These heightened expectations are set forth in the Principles for 

Financial Market Infrastructures (or PFMIs), which were adopted in 2012 by the 

Committee on Payment and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International 


3 
 

Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO).3  The PFMIs lay out 

comprehensive requirements for financial market infrastructures, including CCPs.   

Clearing and settlement activities are cross-border and indeed global in 

nature.  Major U.S. financial institutions interact with market infrastructures 

around the world.  The PFMIs have established a rigorous set of internationally 

agreed upon standards for the quality and quantity of loss-absorbing resources and 

liquidity, governance, risk management, stress testing, recovery and  orderly wind-

down, and other key areas.   

I believe that there has been reasonably good progress in implementing these 

reforms here in the United States.  For example, according to the Financial 

Stability Board, over 70 percent of new U.S. interest rate and credit derivatives are 

now centrally cleared.4  And the Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulatory 

agencies have recently announced final margin rules for uncleared derivatives as 

well, which should enhance the resilience of trading that still occurs outside of 

central clearing.5

But there is still plenty of work left to do.  CCPs are implementing the 

PFMIs under the oversight of national regulators; clearing members have been 

vocal commentators on this process.  To assure that the standards are consistently 

implemented across jurisdictions and across FMIs, CPMI and IOSCO are 

conducting joint reviews of the risk-management practices of a range of global 

derivatives-clearing CCPs.  Working in conjunction with the Basel Committee on 

Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board (FSB), they have also set 

out a detailed work plan for further enhancing the resilience, recovery planning and 

resolvability of CCPs.   

Earlier this year, CPMI-IOSCO conducted surveys of more than 30 of the 

most systemically important CCPs regarding their stress testing, margin, recovery 

planning, and loss allocation frameworks.  The survey responses have now been 

received and are being analyzed.  I expect that these exercises will result in more 

granular guidance to CCPs covering a wide set of operational areas, further helping 

to ensure consistency of implementation of the PFMIs and market infrastructure 

resilience.    

Further work on resolution is also necessary.  The FSB has conducted a 

survey on CCP resolution regimes and resolution planning within its membership, 

and found that many jurisdictions are still in the process of developing resolution 


5 
 

regimes.  As the reform process moves forward, this will be an important area of 

focus.  

All of these efforts are directly aimed at strengthening FMIs.  But the 

strength and resilience of a CCP ultimately depends on the strength and resilience 

of its clearing members.  I’d now like to shift focus to the relationship between 

these market utilities and the institutions that use them.   

 Barring an operational event, CCPs only face credit or liquidity risk when 

one of their members fails to make a payment when due.  Thus, one effective way 

to make a CCP safer is to make its members safer.  In that sense, the post-crisis 

reforms that have greatly strengthened our largest and most systemically important 

banking institutions have directly benefitted CCPs and other FMIs.  

 While requiring bank holding companies and their associated broker-dealers 

to be better capitalized and hold more liquid assets has unquestionably made them 

safer, it has also raised their balance sheet costs and thereby created incentives to 

scale back on less profitable business lines.  Clearing has traditionally been a low 

margin business, and broker-dealers have often offered these services to clients in 

the belief that doing so may lead to more profitable business.  In the new 

environment, broker dealers are reconsidering this model, and may reduce services 

to smaller clients or move to an agency model with higher fees.   


6 
 

Banks and broker-dealers serve not only as clearing members of CCPs, but 

also as liquidity providers and as custodians of their cash and securities.  CCPs 

typically have lines of credit with banks and other arrangements for secured credit 

to meet their potential liquidity needs.  The higher cost of funding for large 

financial institutions has made these liquidity arrangements substantially more 

expensive and more difficult to obtain.  Given the balance sheet costs involved, 

financial institutions may also be less willing to hold cash deposits on behalf of 

their CCP clients.    

 These considerations suggest that there will be a period of adjustment as 

firms and market infrastructures adapt their business models to the new regulatory 

landscape.  This is not necessarily a cause for alarm.  To some extent, these 

adjustments are desirable.  Liquidity risk seems to have been systematically 

underpriced before the crisis.  Firms are now much more focused on both 

managing and more accurately pricing this risk.  It is also appropriate that the 

pricing of a bank’s services accurately reflect the costs and profitability of different 

business lines, which should lead to a more efficient allocation of resources.      

One area where market participants are actively searching for new business 

models is the repo market, where there are currently several private initiatives for 

greater central clearing.  Expanded repo clearing could potentially bring a range of 

benefits, including greater opportunities for netting and related reductions in 


7 
 

balance sheet costs for dealers affiliated with a bank holding company.  The 

evolution of repo markets and central clearing can serve to illustrate both the 

potential benefits and the complexities that arise as the market seeks new 

infrastructure models. 


Repo Clearing 

The U.S. repo market is composed of several segments, as illustrated in 

Figure 3.  Dealers are at the center of the figure and operate in all five of the 

segments shown.  In the bilateral market (segments 1 through 3), participants often 

impose narrow restrictions on the specific securities eligible for collateral.  In this 

portion of the market, cash providers tend to be professional investors such as asset 

managers (segment 1), or the securities dealers themselves.  Cash borrowers 

include prime brokerage clients (segment 3).  Securities dealers may also borrow 

cash in this market, or may borrow it and then redistribute it to other dealers 

(segment 2).   

The tri-party repo market (segments 4 and 5) is used to finance general 

collateral pools rather than specific securities, and trades in this portion of the 

market are settled on the books of the two clearing banks, Bank of New York 


8 
 

Mellon and JP Morgan Chase. 6  Money market mutual funds and securities lenders 

are among the most prominent cash providers in segment 4, while securities 

dealers are the primary borrowers of cash.  Dealers may use this cash to fund their 

own portfolios; they may also lend it to other dealers in the general collateral 

finance (GCF) repo market (segment 5).  This segment is cleared through the Fixed 

Income Clearing Corporation, and is currently the only segment of the market that 

is centrally cleared.   

Based on figures from September 2015, the size of the tri-party repo market, 

segment 4, was approximately $1.5 trillion and the GCF market (segment 5) was 

approximately $300 billion.  The general lack of data on bilateral repo activity 

makes it difficult to know the precise size of each individual segment of that 

market, but bilateral repo and securities lending taken together accounted for 

approximately $1.7 trillion in outstanding activity.7  

Given its vast scale and position at the center of the wholesale finance 

markets, repo is without doubt a critical activity.  Repo is a key source of financing 

for a wide range of firms, and an important “safe asset” for investors.  The GCF 

                                                           
6  General collateral or GC repo involve repo transactions secured by a range of Treasury or other assets that are 
accepted as collateral by the majority of intermediaries in the repo market. GC repo assets are high quality and 
liquid, but not subject to exceptional specific demand. 
7 These estimates are based on the methodology described in Adam Copeland, Isaac Davis, Eric LeSueur, and 
Antoine Martin (2012), “Mapping and Sizing the U.S. Repo Market,”

segment, although modest in size compared to the overall market, is a key source 

of financing for smaller dealers, particularly in times of financial stress.  The 

availability of repo funding for a diverse range of participants supports market 

liquidity by enabling them to make markets in Treasury and agency securities.  

CCPs themselves also rely on these markets, often using repo to earn interest on 

cash collateral and counting on access to repo markets in their liquidity planning.     

The FSB has called on authorities to “consider the pros and cons of 

broadening participation in repo clearing arrangements.”8 What are the potential 

benefits of greater clearing in this market?  In addition to the potential netting 

benefits I mentioned earlier, a CCP typically performs three other beneficial 

economic functions: 1) a reduction in the potential cost of counterparty default 

coming from the orderly liquidation of a defaulting member’s positions, 2) greater 

transparency and a reduction in operational risk from enhanced reporting 

requirements and standardization of data, and 3) the sharing of risk among 

members of the CCP through some mutualization of the costs of a counterparty’s 

default.  I’ll discuss each of these in turn.  

Orderly liquidation

While repos are generally a low risk, low margin business, they proved to be 

vulnerable to runs during the financial crisis, when concerns of possible defaults by 

large financial firms led to a sudden withdrawal of funding from repo markets.  As 

a result, a reform project led by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of New 

York produced a set of measures that have sharply reduced the amount of intraday 

credit and improved risk management practices in the tri-party repo market.  These 

reforms have made the overall structure of that market much safer, and 

significantly reduced the likelihood of a borrower default.  But if a default were to 

take place, some counterparties, particularly those unwilling or unable to hold 

sizable positions, would retain strong incentives to sell assets quickly regardless of 

the price received.     

A repo CCP could help to address this “fire sale” risk.  CCPs have rule-

based processes to dispose of the portfolio of a defaulted member.  CCPs can 

transfer positions to solvent broker-dealers, or hedge positions and auction them 

off over time.   

Greater transparency and reduction in operational risk  

Central clearing could also improve transparency and bring a reduction in 

operational risks.  CCPs are in position to aggregate trade information from all 

clearing members, and thus to monitor and manage counterparty and market-risk 


11 
 

exposure better than individual members.  As I noted earlier, we have relatively 

little information on bilateral repo activity, so greater clearing in this segment 

could have significant benefits in helping to aggregate market information.  CCPs 

also provide participants with central confirmation of trades and netting of 

positions, allowing their members to reduce operational risk of post-trade 

processing.  



Risk sharing  

In terms of risk sharing, when a CCP clearing member defaults, any 

resulting losses are shared among the surviving members and the CCP itself 

according to pre-agreed rules.  Members of a CCP contribute to a default fund that 

can be used to absorb these losses.  The degree of risk sharing depends on the 

design of the CCP, but transparent rules help to create an orderly, predictable 

process for managing a default.9  

Finding a way forward 

The potential benefits of proposals for expanded central clearing of repo in 

U.S. markets are undergoing a period of evaluation by regulatory authorities and 

                                                           
9 While details vary, in a waterfall, to cover losses resulting from a defaulting member, a CCP typically first uses the 
financial resources of the defaulting member, including margin and default fund contributions. If losses still exist, 
then the CCP uses its capital (skin in the game), followed by the default fund contributions of surviving members. 
Further losses could be absorbed by additional assessments on surviving members. 


12 
 

market participants alike.  For these proposals, it will not be a simple matter to find 

a way forward while meeting the heightened regulatory expectations I mentioned 

earlier.  The liquidity requirement of the PFMIs will present a particular challenge 

-- a CCP must have sufficient liquid resources to meet its payment obligations on 

time in extreme but plausible market conditions, including in the event of a default 

of that participant whose default would generate the largest obligations.10  In repo 

trading, unlike in swaps, the full notional principal amount is exchanged at the 

beginning and end of the trade.  As a result, the liquidity requirements for repo 

clearing will be quite high.   

Another key question is how great the opportunities for netting actually are, 

in light of the dominance of “one-way flows” in U.S. repo markets. Netting for 

balance sheet purposes is only permitted for offsetting trades with the same 

maturity and counterparty.11  The many repo market participants who act as either 

lenders or borrowers – but not both – have little opportunity for netting.  Netting 

opportunities are therefore more likely to occur in the interdealer market, so it is 

not surprising that the current repo CCP operates in this segment of the market.12

12 Repo CCPs mainly exist in markets where the underlying flows provide large-scale opportunities for multilateral 
netting.  For example, CCPs play a large role in the European and the Canadian repo markets, which are primarily 
interbank markets. 


13 
 

Further gains in netting could arise if clearing expanded to the bilateral market or if 

some of the larger end users in the tri-party market, for example money market 

mutual funds or hedge funds, were able to gain access to the CCP.  This could pose 

its own complications, however, as some of these institutions may be unwilling or 

legally unable to engage in the risk mutualization that exists in most clearing 

models.   

Conclusion 

Despite these challenges, it is worth noting that, in the right setting, central 

clearing can produce significant benefits, including reduced credit and liquidity 

risks; improved default management and reduced risk of fire sales; greater 

transparency; and improved risk management.  Of course, this does not mean that 

every product should be cleared, or that every type of repo trading would benefit 

from clearing.  In my view, clearing should be limited to those assets that are 

highly liquid and expected to remain so even in severely stressed market 

conditions.  While any model for expanded repo clearing will have to satisfy 

stringent regulatory requirements, regulators should be open to emerging clearing 

solutions where they provide substantial benefits and can meet these standards.  

This may be particularly true for repo trading in government and agency securities, 

since new regulations require financial institutions to hold such high-quality 

collateral under the assumption that it can be quickly converted to cash.  It is 


14 
 

therefore important to consider ways to support their continued liquidity where 

possible.
