“Certain Uncertainty:  Tax Policy in Unsettled Times” 
 National Tax Association 49th Annual Spring Symposium 

Washington, D.C. 

May 16, 2019 



It is a pleasure to be here at the National Tax Association Annual Spring Symposium.  

Just as it may take the tax experts and practitioners here today some time to disentangle the 

longer-term implications of recent major changes to tax policy, so, too, we are in the process of 

analyzing the lessons for monetary policy of apparent post-crisis changes in the relationships 

among employment, inflation, and interest rates.1   

The Congress has assigned the Federal Reserve the job of using monetary policy to 

achieve maximum employment and price stability.  Price stability means moderate and stable 

inflation, which the Federal Reserve has defined to be 2 percent inflation.  Maximum 

employment is understood as the highest level of employment consistent with price stability.  In 

the aftermath of the Great Recession, which had deep and persistent effects, it is important to 

understand whether there have been long-lasting changes in the relationships among 

employment, inflation, and interest rates in order to ensure our policy framework remains 

effective. 

Employment and Inflation 

This expansion will soon become the longest on record in the United States.  Growth has 

persisted throughout the past decade, overcoming downdrafts from abroad and pullbacks in fiscal 

support earlier in the expansion and benefiting last year from a large fiscal boost.  Recent data 

confirm that consumers remain confident, workers are productive, and businesses are hiring, 

although trade conflict is creating uncertainty.   

The job market is strong.  At 3.6 percent, the unemployment rate is now lower than it was 

before the crisis.  At 80 percent, the employment rate for workers in their prime working-age

years—a more comprehensive measure of slack that includes shifts in labor force participation as 

well as unemployment—has recently risen close to its pre-crisis level. 

In contrast, the picture on inflation is puzzling this far into an expansion.  Despite the 

strengthening of the labor market, the measure of core inflation excluding volatile food and 

energy prices did not move up to 2 percent on a sustained basis until last year, and in the most 

recent reading, the 12-month change has moved down to 1.6 percent.  Other inflation measures 

paint a somewhat more reassuring picture.  The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean measure of inflation, 

which provides a different way to filter out idiosyncratic movements in various components of 

inflation, has increased 2 percent in the past 12 months, slightly higher than its level of 

1.9 percent for the two previous years.2   

The New Normal 

Since the Great Recession, there have been several changes in macroeconomic 

relationships, which I refer to as the new normal.3  Now is a good time to assess the 

characteristics of the new normal and what they mean for monetary policy.  The emerging 

contours of today’s new normal are defined by low sensitivity of inflation to changes in labor 

market slack, a low long-term neutral rate of interest, and low underlying trend inflation.  Let me 

take each in turn.   

In today’s new normal, price inflation has not moved up consistently as the labor market 

has strengthened considerably over the course of the long expansion.  This is what economists 

                                                 
2 For an assessment of the relative strengths of the ex-food-and-energy and trimmed mean measures of personal 
consumption expenditures inflation, see Jim Dolmas and Evan F. Koenig (2019), “Two Measures of Core Inflation:  
A Comparison,” Working Paper Series 1903 (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, February),

mean when they say the Phillips curve is very flat:  The historical relationship between resource 

slack and price inflation appears to have broken down.4  Although wage growth has been moving 

progressively higher as labor market slack has diminished, broader price inflation has remained 

muted. 

Another important feature of today’s new normal is that the long-run neutral interest rate 

seems to be lower than it was historically.  The neutral rate of interest refers to the level of the 

federal funds rate that would maintain the economy at full employment and 2 percent inflation if 

no tailwinds or headwinds were buffeting the economy.  The decline in the neutral rate likely 

reflects a variety of forces globally, such as the aging of the population in many large economies, 

some slowing in the rate of productivity growth, and increases in the demand for safe assets. 

When one looks at the Federal Reserve’s Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), it is striking 

that over the past five years, since the SEP interest rate projections first became available, the 

median estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined 1-1/2 percentage points, from 

4-1/4 percent to 2-3/4 percent.  Going back further to the two decades before the crisis shows a 

similar decline in today’s long-run neutral rate relative to earlier Blue Chip consensus forecasts 

of the long-run federal funds rate.5 

Third, underlying trend inflation—the trend in inflation after filtering out idiosyncratic 

and transitory factors—appears to be somewhat below the Federal Reserve’s goal of 2 percent.  

This raises the risk that households and businesses could come to expect inflation to run

persistently below the Federal Reserve’s target and could change their behavior in a way that 

reinforces that expectation.  Expectations are an important determinant of actual inflation 

because wage and price behavior by businesses and households is partly based on expectations of 

future inflation. 

While low inflation and low interest rates have many benefits, the new normal presents a 

challenge for the conventional approach to monetary policy, in which the Federal Reserve could 

rely on changes in the level of the federal funds rate to achieve its inflation and employment 

goals.  In past recessions, the Federal Reserve has typically cut interest rates by 4 to 5 percentage 

points in order to support household and business spending and hiring.  With the long-run neutral 

rate low and with underlying trend inflation somewhat below target, nominal interest rates are 

likely to remain below those levels, which therefore leaves less room to cut rates as much as 

needed.  With less room to ease financial conditions and support economic activity using our 

conventional policy tool, the economy may endure prolonged periods during and after recessions 

with short-term interest rates pinned at their effective lower bound.  That, of course, was what 

happened following the financial crisis, when the Federal Reserve kept interest rates close to 

zero from December 2008 through November 2015.   

That constraint limits the Federal Reserve’s ability to provide stimulus through its 

conventional tool and thus could tend to leave inflation lower than it would otherwise be, and 

unemployment higher.  The experience of several years with the federal funds rate pinned at its 

effective lower bound and actual inflation below our target could weigh on expectations for 

future inflation and thereby influence the behavior of households and businesses that helps 

determine wages and prices.  The experience of a sustained period of low inflation could depress 

underlying trend inflation by feeding into lower inflation expectations, further reducing nominal

interest rates and the space to cut interest rates in what could become a downward spiral.6  So we 

need to be especially careful to preserve as much of our conventional policy space as we can, 

while exploring mechanisms to augment the effectiveness of our framework.7 

Maximum Employment in the New Normal 

The new normal has some important benefits.  With subdued inflation, the sustained 

expansion has drawn workers back into the labor market after a damaging recession.  The 

unemployment rate is approaching a 50-year low, and the overall labor force participation rate 

has remained constant despite the long-term aging of the population that would otherwise be 

pushing participation lower.   

Like the overall unemployment rate, broader measures of labor market slack are also 

lower than their pre-crisis levels.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U-6 measure shows that two 

groups have recently shrunk to pre-crisis levels after rising considerably during the recession:  

those working part time who would prefer full-time employment and people marginally attached 

to the labor force who have looked for work in the previous year but stopped looking more 

recently.  The strong labor market is leading to employment gains among workers with

disabilities. Research suggests it may be helping to narrow some of the long-standing disparities 

for some racial minorities, although this development is tentative and modest.8 

We hear from business contacts that they are now hiring workers they may not previously 

have considered.  During the recession, the evidence suggests that many employers raised their 

requirements for many job categories.  As labor markets have tightened, employers in certain 

sectors, occupations, and areas of the country report they are loosening requirements and 

investing more in training.  That means today’s economy is providing opportunities for workers 

who might previously have been left on the sidelines—including those with records of past 

incarceration or who lack a particular certification or degree.   

Given that the large majority of working-age households, those at the middle and lower 

ends of the income distribution, rely primarily on wage income, advancing our employment 

mandate has served the country well.  In today’s new normal, with the low responsiveness of 

inflation to labor market tightness, there appears to be little evidence so far of a tradeoff with our 

price-stability objective.  The sustained strengthening of the labor market also adds to the 

productive capacity of the economy by attracting people on the sidelines to join or rejoin the 

labor force and move into employment. 

What about the Risks? 

Of course, there are also risks.  The past three downturns were precipitated not by rising 

inflation pressure, but rather by the buildup of financial imbalances.  Extended periods of above-

potential growth and low interest rates tend to be accompanied by rapid credit growth and

elevated asset valuations, which tend to boost downside risks to the economy.9  It is not hard to 

see why a high-pressure economy might be associated with elevated financial imbalances, 

especially late in the cycle.  As an expansion continues, the memory of the previous recession 

fades.  Profits tend to rise, experienced loss rates on loans are low, and people tend to project 

recent trends into the future, which leads financial market participants and borrowers to become 

overly optimistic.  Risk appetite rises, asset valuations become stretched, and credit is available 

on easier terms and to riskier borrowers than earlier in the cycle when memories of losses were 

still fresh. 

Historically, when the Phillips curve was steeper, inflation tended to rise as the economy 

heated up, which naturally prompted the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  In turn, the 

interest rate increases would have the collateral effect of damping increases in asset prices and 

risk appetites.  With a flat Phillips curve, inflation does not rise as much as resource utilization 

tightens, and, accordingly, provides less necessity for the Federal Reserve to raise rates to 

restrictive levels.  At the same time, low interest rates along with sustained strong economic 

conditions are conducive to increasing risk appetites prompting reach-for-yield behavior and 

boosting financial excesses late in an expansion.   

With the forces holding down interest rates likely to persist, valuation pressures and risky 

corporate debt, such as leveraged lending, could well remain at elevated levels.  Elevated 

valuations and corporate debt could leave the economy more vulnerable to negative shocks.  The 

market volatility in December is a reminder of how sensitive markets can be to downside 

surprises.

A key implication of the weakening in the relationship between inflation and 

employment, then, is that we should not assume monetary policy will act to restrain the financial 

cycle as much as previously.  As a consequence, policymakers may need to think differently 

about the interplay of the financial and business cycles due to the combination of a low neutral 

rate, a flat Phillips curve, and low underlying inflation.  With financial stability risks likely to be 

more tightly linked to the business cycle than in the past, it may make sense to take actions other 

than tightening monetary policy to temper the financial cycle.  In order to enable monetary 

policy to focus on supporting the return of inflation to our symmetric 2 percent target on a 

sustained basis along with maximum employment, we should be looking to countercyclical tools 

to temper the financial cycle.   

One tool other central banks have been using to help temper the financial cycle is the 

countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB).  The CCyB provides regulators with the authority to 

require large banks to build up an extra capital buffer as financial risks mount.10  Although the 

CCyB was authorized as part of the post-crisis package of reforms, so far, the Federal Reserve 

has chosen not to use it. Turning on the CCyB would build an extra layer of resilience and signal 

restraint, helping to damp the rising vulnerability of the overall system.  Moreover, because the 

CCyB is explicitly countercyclical, it is intended to be cut if the outlook deteriorates, boosting 

the ability of banks to make loans when extending credit is most needed and providing a valuable 

signal about policymakers’ intentions.  This feature proved to be valuable in the United Kingdom 

in the wake of the Brexit referendum.

Institute for International Economics, Washington, December 7,

If countercyclical tools and other regulatory safeguards are not adequate over the cycle, 

monetary policy will need to carry a greater burden in leaning against financial excesses.  That 

would be unfortunate, because adding financial stability concerns to the burden of conventional 

monetary policy might undermine sustained achievement of our employment and inflation goals.   

Because the financial cycle is today likely to be tempered less than in the past by material 

increases in interest rates as the economy expands, the appropriate level of bank capital for 

today’s conditions is unlikely to be the same as in past business cycles:  Because interest rates 

likely will do less than in past cycles, regulatory buffers will need to do more.  As a 

consequence, now is a bad time to be weakening the core resilience of our largest banking 

institutions or to be weakening oversight over the nonbank financial system.  Instead, we should 

be safeguarding the capital and liquidity buffers of banks at the center of the system, carefully 

monitoring risks in the nonbank sector, and making good use of the countercyclical tool that we 

have. 

Achieving our Inflation Objective on a Sustained Basis 

Finally, let us turn to the apparent softness in underlying trend inflation.  One hypothesis 

for the flat Phillips curve is that central banks have been so effective in anchoring inflation 

expectations that tightening resource utilization is no longer transmitted to price inflation.11  

Another possibility is that structural factors such as administrative changes to health care costs, 

globalization, or technological-enabled disruption have been dominant in recent years, masking

the operation of cyclical forces.12  Regardless, because inflation is ultimately a monetary 

phenomenon, the Federal Reserve has the capacity and the responsibility to ensure inflation 

expectations are firmly anchored at—and not below—our target. 

As I have argued in the past, the fact that inflation has been running somewhat below our 

longer-run goal of 2 percent may not be entirely due to labor market slack or to transitory 

shocks; it also likely reflects some softening in inflation’s underlying trend.13  First, estimates of 

underlying inflation based on statistical filters are lower than they were before the financial crisis 

and are currently below 2 percent.  Second, estimates of longer-run inflation expectations based 

on the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and on inflation compensation from 

financial market pricing are also running lower than before the financial crisis.14   

Our goal now is to get underlying trend inflation around our target on a sustained basis.  

What would this take?  We can get some sense from statistical models.  Although there is no one 

widely agreed-upon method of measuring underlying inflation, one statistical approach that has 

received attention in recent years captures the idea that underlying inflation responds to the

experience with actual inflation, and that this responsiveness varies over time.15  We can use 

such an approach to get an idea of how much, and how quickly, underlying inflation might 

respond to any particular path for actual inflation.  It provides some reassurance that our goal 

may be achievable if inflation moves only slightly above 2 percent for a couple of years.  The 

SEP inflation projections of Committee members suggest that many have, over the past year or 

so, envisaged a few years of a mild overshoot.16   

Of course, it is not entirely clear how to move underlying trend inflation smoothly to our 

target on a sustained basis in the presence of a very flat Phillips curve.  One possibility we might 

refer to as “opportunistic reflation” would be to take advantage of a modest increase in actual 

inflation to demonstrate to the public our commitment to our inflation goal on a symmetric 

basis.17  For example, suppose that an unexpected increase in core import price inflation drove 

overall inflation modestly above 2 percent for a couple of years.  The Federal Reserve could use 

that opportunity to communicate that a mild overshooting of inflation is consistent with our goals 

and to align policy with that statement.  Such an approach could help demonstrate to the public 

that the Committee is serious about achieving its 2 percent inflation objective on a sustained 

basis.

responsiveness of underlying inflation to actual inflation to vary over time and suggests that responsiveness—the 
“gain”—has been lower in recent years than in the 1970s and 1980s.

Conclusion 

In today’s new normal, it is important to achieve inflation and inflation expectations 

around our 2 percent target on a sustained basis while guarding against financial imbalances 

through active use of countercyclical tools.  We want to be mindful of the risk of financial 

imbalances that could amplify any shock and help tip the economy into recession, which the 

Federal Reserve has less conventional space to address in today’s low interest rate environment.  

In my view, it is therefore wise to proceed cautiously, helping to sustain the expansion and 

further gains in employment and with appropriate regulatory safeguards that reduce the risk of 

dangerous financial imbalances.
