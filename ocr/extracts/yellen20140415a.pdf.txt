Good morning.  I’m delighted to have this opportunity to speak to you today, even 

though I am unable to be with you in person.  I’d like to share a few thoughts about the 

important issues that the Financial Markets Conference (FMC) is addressing this year.  

Many of these issues, of course, are ones the FMC has grappled with every year since the 

crisis, an event which elevated the importance of this gathering and of the vital 

contributions made by the research and the policy discussion the FMC fosters.  

One of those issues is liquidity.  Maturity transformation is a central part of the 

economic function of banks and many other types of financial intermediaries.  But as we 

saw in the crisis, maturity transformation also exposes intermediaries to liquidity risk, 

particularly when intermediaries are heavily reliant on short-term wholesale funding.  In 

2007 and 2008, short-term creditors ran from firms such as Northern Rock, Bear Stearns, 

and Lehman Brothers, and from money market mutual funds and asset-backed 

commercial paper programs.  Together, these runs were the primary engine of a financial 

crisis from which the United States and the global economy have yet to fully recover.   

In response to the crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s first task 

was to strengthen bank capital requirements through the adoption of the Basel III capital 

accord and, last summer, our domestic rule implementing the Basel III capital 

requirements in the United States.  Strong bank capital rules remain the foundation of 

bank regulation.  But capital requirements as currently constructed are generally based on 

credit and market risks from the asset side of the balance sheet and from off-balance-

sheet transactions.  They do not directly address liquidity risk.  

Thus, the Basel Committee’s second task was to develop new liquidity standards 

for global banking firms: the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and the Net Stable 


 - 2 - 

Funding Ratio (NSFR).  The LCR is designed to improve a bank’s ability to withstand 

severe short-term liquidity stress events by requiring banking firms to hold a buffer of 

highly liquid assets to cover net cash outflows in a 30-day stress scenario.  The NSFR is 

meant to promote resilience over a one-year horizon by requiring banks that hold less 

liquid assets to fund their activities with more stable sources of funding.  

As others have observed, the new Basel liquidity standards address financial 

stability risks associated with excessive maturity transformation through at least two 

channels.   

First, the new standards insulate banks from liquidity shocks.  In the case of the 

LCR, requiring firms to hold a buffer of highly liquid assets will help to ensure that they 

have a means of generating liquidity in the event of creditor runs.  In the case of the 

NSFR, requiring firms to use higher levels of stable funding for less liquid assets reduces 

the vulnerabilities of a firm to structural maturity mismatches.  Banking firms that self-

insure against liquidity risk in these ways are less likely to need government liquidity 

support in times of stress. 

Second, the new standards provide an incentive for firms to move to more stable 

funding structures.  Under the LCR and NSFR, firms that engage in unstable forms of 

maturity transformation will be required to maintain buffers of highly liquid assets and 

use stable funding, both of which will impose costs for the firms.  Reducing the amount 

of maturity transformation they engage in will help firms minimize these costs.  

While the LCR and NSFR are important steps forward, they do not fully address 

the financial stability concerns associated with short-term wholesale funding.  These 

standards tend to focus on the liquidity positions of firms taken in isolation, rather than 


 - 3 - 

on the financial system as a whole.  They only apply to internationally active banks, and 

not directly to shadow banks, despite the fact that liquidity shocks within the shadow 

banking system played a major role in the crisis.  Furthermore, the current versions of the 

LCR and NSFR do not address financial stability risks associated with so-called matched 

books of securities financing transactions.   

Federal Reserve staff are actively considering additional measures that could 

address these and other residual risks in the short-term wholesale funding markets.  Some 

of these measures--such as requiring firms to hold larger amounts of capital, stable 

funding, or highly liquid assets based on use of short-term wholesale funding--would 

likely apply only to the largest, most complex banking organizations.  Other measures--

such as minimum margin requirements for repurchase agreements and other securities 

financing transactions--could, at least in principle, apply on a marketwide basis.  In 

designing such measures, we are carefully thinking through questions about the tradeoffs 

associated with tighter liquidity regulation that will be discussed at this conference. 

While these cost-benefit questions are difficult to answer with either certainty or 

precision, let me highlight one data point that suggests that there may be net social gains 

from introducing further reforms to address short-term wholesale funding risks.  In 2010, 

the Basel Committee assessed the long-term economic impact of stronger capital and 

liquidity requirements for global banks.  Factoring in the Basel III capital requirements 

and the NSFR, the Basel study suggested that tightening risk-based capital and liquidity 

requirements would, on net, provide economic benefits, and that benefits would continue 

to accrue at even higher levels of risk-based capital than are part of Basel III.   


 - 4 - 

While it would be a mistake to give undue weight to any one study, this study 

provides some support for the view that there might be room for stronger capital and 

liquidity standards for large banks than have been adopted so far.   

As the Board continues to weigh such steps to further strengthen the financial 

system, I expect that conferences like the FMC will continue to be a vital part of the 

process, providing the ideas, analysis, and debate that will help us make the best possible 

judgments.  Thank you for listening and for this opportunity to be a part of this important 

conference.
