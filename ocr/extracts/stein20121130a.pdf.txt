The Third Boston University/Boston Fed Conference on Macro-Finance Linkages 


Boston, Massachusetts 








November 30, 2012 




Given that the conference theme is macro-finance linkages, I thought I would try 

to lay out a corporate finance perspective on large-scale asset purchases (LSAPs).  I have 

found this perspective helpful in thinking both about the general efficacy of LSAPs going 

forward, and about the differential effects of buying Treasury securities as opposed to 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  But before I get started, please note the usual 

disclaimer:  The thoughts that follow are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views 

of other members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  I should also 

mention that these comments echo some that I made in a speech at Brookings last 

month.

  As I noted in that speech, I support the Committee’s decision to purchase 

mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a rate of $40 billion per month, in tandem with the 

ongoing maturity extension program in Treasury securities, and its plan to continue with 

asset purchases if the Committee does not observe a substantial improvement in the 

outlook for the labor market. 

I will start with the case of Treasury LSAPs, and then go on to discuss the 

differences that arise when the Fed purchases MBS instead.  One thing that seems clear in 

the data is that if you buy a lot of long-term Treasury securities, this exerts significant 

downward pressure on their yields and term premiums.  Indeed, the Fed’s past actions are 

likely one important reason why Treasury term premiums are now near historic lows, on 

the order of minus 80 basis points, according to a model used by the Board staff.

Moreover, while this is not entirely uncontroversial, my own reading of the evidence is

that there has also been substantial pass-through to corporate bond rates.  Based on this 

evidence, a reasonable estimate is that, if the Fed were to undertake an additional $500 

billion Treasury LSAP, both long-term Treasury and corporate bond rates might be 

expected to decline by something on the order of 15 to 20 basis points.   

This observation leads to an important conceptual question:  How should one 

expect a firm to respond when its long-term borrowing costs fall not because of a change 

in the expected future path of short-term rates--as would be the case with a conventional 

monetary easing--but rather because of a change in the term premium?  By way of a 

benchmark, it should be emphasized that many macro models--including the Fed staff’s 

FRB/US model--implicitly treat the two sorts of shocks as having similar effects on 

corporate investment.  But is there any reason to believe that, in reality, the response to 

the two might differ? 

A basic corporate finance analysis suggests the answer may be yes--and, in 

particular, that a shock to the term premium is more likely to elicit a financing response 

on the part of firms, as opposed to a change in their capital spending plans.  To see why, 

consider the following example.  A firm faces a rate on its 10-year bonds of 2 percent.  At 

the same time, it expects that the sequence of rolled-over short-term rates over the next 

10 years will average 3 percent.  Hence, there is a term premium of minus 1 percent.  

What should the firm do?  Clearly, it should take advantage of the cheap long-term debt 

by issuing bonds.  But if the firm is not facing a binding financing constraint, it is less 

obvious that the bargain 2 percent rate on these bonds should exert any influence on its 

capital spending plans.  After all, it can use the proceeds of the bond issue to pay down 

short-term debt, repurchase stock, or buy short-term securities.  These capital-structure

adjustments all yield an effective return of 3 percent.  As a result, the hurdle rate for new 

investment should remain pinned at 3 percent.  In other words, the negative term 

premium matters a lot for financing behavior, but in this stylized world, investment 

spending is decoupled from the term premium and is determined instead by the expected 

future path of short rates.  

This reasoning suggests why one might expect future rounds of Treasury-based 

LSAPs to have diminishing returns, at least for corporate investment.  As noted earlier, 

the data make clear that past rounds of LSAPs have pushed down interest rates and term 

premiums.  But the further the term premium is driven into negative territory, and the 

more financing constraints are thereby relaxed, the more the previous logic comes into 

play, and hence the weaker is likely to be the response of aggregate spending to further 

downward pressure on long-term rates.  

The corporate finance example is also consistent with what we have observed in 

markets in recent months.  Issuance of both investment-grade and high-yield bonds has 

been robust.  Indeed, domestic nonfinancial corporate bond issuance is on pace to set a 

record in 2012, and the speculative-grade segment appears on track to register a new high 

for the year.  At the same time, a large fraction of issuance has been devoted to 

refinancing--either to retiring existing debt or to payouts to equity holders via dividends 

and share buybacks.  These uses of proceeds have accounted for about two-thirds of all 

issuance by speculative-grade firms so far this year.  Such patterns are what one would 

expect based on the logic I have just discussed.   

Another way to make a similar point is to note that as borrowing costs have fallen, 

Federal Reserve staff estimates of the expected return on the stock market (using a model 


- 4 - 




based on analysts’ earnings expectations) remain high by historic standards.  This 

unusually large divergence in the costs of debt and equity--due in part to the cumulative 

effects of our LSAP policies--is likely to be one factor that makes debt-financed 

repurchases of equity attractive.   

Let me turn now from Treasury-based LSAPs to those involving MBS.  If there is 

to be any difference between the two, one necessary condition is that there is some form 

of market segmentation, so that buying MBS has a different effect on the constellation of 

credit-market rates than buying Treasury securities--in other words, it’s not all about just 

removing a certain amount of undifferentiated duration from the market.  Judging by 

what happened in the wake of the Committee’s policy announcement on September 13, 

this segmentation condition seems to be clearly satisfied--indeed, I would say 

surprisingly so.

  In particular, while nominal long-term Treasury yields were roughly 

unchanged on the day of the announcement, yields on MBS fell dramatically.  Moreover, 

although the pass-through to primary mortgage rates has been more gradual, it too has 

been significant to date.   According to Freddie Mac’s primary mortgage market survey, 

the rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has come down by more than 20 basis points 

since the September announcement, and is now near historic lows. 

One way to say it is that, given the nature of market segmentation, MBS 

purchases appear to trade off of some amount of breadth of effect across markets for a 

more pronounced effect in a single market--namely, the mortgage market.  What, then, 

are the implications for the transmission mechanism?  Clearly, it depends on the 

sensitivity of different forms of spending to changes in rates.  If, per my previous

example, corporate investment reacts only weakly to further changes in term premiums, 

there may be more “kick” to be had by focusing efforts on a sector that is more 

responsive. 

Moreover, it seems plausible that households’ spending behavior will in fact be 

more strongly affected by changes in the mortgage rate.  As compared with many of the 

large firms that are active in the corporate bond market, one might expect a greater 

proportion of households to behave as if they are financially constrained.  Hence, a 

reduction in the cost of mortgage borrowing might be expected to allow households to 

spend more, either on a new home or by using the proceeds from a mortgage refinancing 

for non-housing consumption.   

The bottom line is that I suspect that mortgage purchases may confer more 

macroeconomic stimulus dollar-for-dollar than Treasury purchases.  This is of course, not 

to say that Treasury purchases have no effect on the real economy; research has found 

that in addition to moving bond prices, they are associated with increases in stock prices, 

which in turn can have wealth effects on consumption and investment.   

Interestingly, however, to the extent that Treasury purchases trigger a financing 

response on the part of firms, as opposed to an investment response, they may have 

something of an unintended benefit for financial stability.  A major source of problems 

during the recent crisis was the excessive maturity transformation undertaken by financial 

firms.  Put simply, these firms were relying too much on short-term debt.  One of the 

thrusts of regulatory reform has been to attack this problem--for example, via the 

constructs of the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and the Net Stable Funding Ratio that are a 

part of Basel III.  However, a complementary way to deal with the problem is to

influence the underlying incentives for short-term debt issuance.  And these incentives 

are in turn shaped by the structure of rates and term premiums in the market.   

As I noted earlier, a natural response for any firm facing an unusually low term 

premium is to adjust its capital structure by issuing cheap long-term debt to replace its 

shorter-term debt.  It is therefore not surprising that the average debt maturity of large 

nonfinancial firms has increased notably over the past few years.  Moreover, the same 

pattern shows up among large financial firms--they too have been significantly 

lengthening their average debt maturity.  

The current cheapness of long-term debt contrasts with the pre-crisis 

configuration, where frequently a pronounced premium favored issuers not at the long 

end of the yield curve, but at the very short end.  In other words, the fact that the yield 

curve often tended to be steeply upward sloping at the front end gave financial firms a 

strong incentive to issue overnight paper.  Thus I suspect that LSAPs have, by changing 

the structure of term premiums in the market, helped encourage an extension of debt 

maturity by both financial and nonfinancial firms.  All else being equal, this development 

is a good thing from a financial stability perspective. 

To conclude:  A corporate finance perspective on LSAPs suggests that when 

monetary policy works by moving term premiums, as opposed to moving expectations 

about the future path of short rates, the transmission to the real economy may be altered 

in important ways.  These differences can have implications for how we think about the 

benefits of a policy action, its costs, and even its consequences for financial stability.   

Thanks very much, and I look forward to your questions.
