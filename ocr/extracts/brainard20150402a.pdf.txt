Ninth Biennial Federal Reserve System Community Development Research Conference

April 2, 2015 
 



I am pleased to join you for the ninth biennial Federal Reserve System 

Community Development Research Conference.  This conference has established itself as 

an important venue for sharing research and exchanging ideas on how best to support the 

advancement of low- and moderate-income communities.   

The many economic decisions an individual makes early in his or her working 

life--their first job, how much and what kind of an educational investment to make, how 

to finance that investment, whether to strike out on their own, and whether to rent or buy 

a home--can have a lasting effect on their subsequent financial security and the economic 

foundation they provide for their children.  There are times, however, when larger forces 

materially interrupt or impede the individual efforts of young people to build a better 

economic life.  The Great Depression left an indelible imprint on the generation that 

came of age in that era, influencing their subsequent job trajectories and attitudes toward 

risk and investment.  The question we face today is whether the Great Recession may 

similarly leave a lasting mark on the many Americans who came of age in its shadow.  

It is important to understand the headwinds encountered by the Great Recession 

generation as they navigated a daunting job market, and the lessons they have taken from 

the crisis, particularly with respect to investments in education and housing.  And it is 

important to identify what actions can be taken to improve economic outcomes for the 

Great Recession generation, as their experiences will powerfully influence not just 

growth today, but also the contours of opportunity faced by their children. 

Employment and Participation in the Labor Force 

Let’s start by considering what it was like to graduate from high school or college 

in June 2009.  The overall unemployment rate stood at 9.5 percent, and employers 


 - 2 - 

slashed 500,000 jobs that month, the 18th month in a row of job cuts.  For young people, 

job prospects were even bleaker.  Nearly one-fourth of teenagers in the labor force were 

unemployed, and the unemployment rate for people between the ages of 20 and 24 stood 

at 15.2 percent.  Young African Americans and Hispanics experienced higher rates of 

unemployment than their white peers. 

Even these painfully high unemployment rates--the highest since the early 1980s--

understate the damage caused by the Great Recession to young people’s work lives.  The 

lack of job opportunities appears to have caused many young people to become so 

discouraged that they dropped out of the labor force altogether, exacerbating a downtrend 

and driving labor force participation among young people to historical lows.   

Even for those who remained in the labor force and have been fortunate to find 

work, compensation prospects have been poor.  For example, inflation-adjusted full-time 

weekly earnings among 19- to 24-year-olds with only a high school diploma fell about 

5 percent between 2008 and 2012.1   

Of those who have found work, not only are many young people receiving low 

wages, but also many are working at jobs for which they are overqualified.  A recent 

study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston found that employers responded to the 

slack labor market by increasing the educational requirements or the number of years of 

experience required for new hires, which likely froze out many from the labor pool and

resulted in the underemployment of others.2  In 2012, roughly 45 percent of college 

graduates between the ages of 22 and 27 were underemployed, up by one-third relative to 

2001 and the highest underemployment rate since the early 1990s.3  Moreover, a recent 

study by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that the Great 

Recession is prolonging the time it takes for a college graduate to settle into a career.4   

Recently, the labor market prospects for young people have started to improve, 

with the unemployment rate for 20- to 24-year-olds falling about one-third relative to its 

peak and inflation-adjusted earnings starting to rise.  Nevertheless, even with this recent 

improvement, there is a risk that the high rates of unemployment, low labor force 

attachment, and stagnant wages experienced by those who have come of age in the years 

surrounding the Great Recession may have long-lasting consequences.  A number of 

studies have found that graduating from college during a recession can have a lasting 

effect.  If past studies hold true today, the employment rate of those graduating from 

college during the Great Recession may recover relatively soon, but their earnings may 

be reduced for up to a decade or longer as this cohort initially secures lower-quality jobs 

and then only gradually works its way back up to the normal earnings trajectory.5  To the 

extent that these lost earnings translate into reductions in lifetime resources, they could 

affect life-cycle spending and investment decisions, topics that I will turn to next.

Education and Student Debt 

Enrollment in colleges and graduate schools increased sharply during the Great 

Recession.  With skyrocketing youth unemployment and compensation under pressure, 

the recession sharply reduced the opportunity costs of additional years of schooling.6  For 

many, these additional educational investments are likely to be beneficial.  Investing in 

additional education is a classic way of mitigating the negative effects of graduating in a 

recession, and empirical research suggests that the lifetime returns to completing a 

college degree are substantial on average.7   

As with any investment, however, the returns on educational investments are not 

uniform, and some investments do not pay off.  The risk of a low return is accentuated 

when the investment is financed through debt and based on the assumption that the 

educational investment will translate into higher wages that make the debt payments 

affordable.   

Indeed, student indebtedness rose sharply in the years surrounding the Great 

Recession.8  The capacity of many families to pay for tuition was substantially reduced 

by the declines in income and wealth associated with the housing crisis and the deep 

recession.  At the same time, public colleges and universities--long the most affordable 

                                                 
6 Those graduating into a recession are slightly more likely to obtain an advanced degree.  See Joseph G. 
Altonji, Lisa B. Kahn, and Jamin D. Speer (2014), “Cashier or Consultant?  Entry Labor Market

option for students--saw some of the steepest rises in tuition as a result of state and local 

budget pressures due to the recession (and possibly reductions in quality in many cases).9  

Thirty-seven states have cut per-student funding for higher education more than 

20 percent since the 2007-08 academic year, when the recession began.  Since the outset 

of the recession, the annual published tuition at four-year public colleges increased 

24 percent, after adjusting for inflation, during a period when real median incomes 

declined 8 percent.10   

This confluence of higher enrollments, higher tuitions, reduced family resources, 

and uneven job prospects has caused outstanding student loan balances to more than 

double since the start of the Great Recession.11  Moreover, this sharp rise in debt burdens 

is unevenly distributed across the population, with students from socioeconomically 

disadvantaged backgrounds disproportionately likely to use debt to finance education.  In 

2012, 79 percent of bachelor’s degree recipients whose parents made under $30,000 

incurred educational debt, compared with 55 percent of those whose parents had income

Education below Pre-Recession Levels (Washington:  Center on Budget and Policy Priorities),

10  The change in public tuition is for tuition and fees, excluding room and board, and is from the National 
Center for Education Statistics website at 
http://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d13/tables/dt13_330.10.asp?current=yes.  Published tuition rates do not 
reflect what students actually pay after financial aid and other assistance.  The trend in real median income 
comes from Carmen DeNavas-Walt and Bernadette D. Proctor (2014), Income and Poverty in the United 
States:  2013 (Washington:  United States Census Bureau), 
www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2014/demo/p60-249.pdf. 
11 The total amount of outstanding student debt, $1.2 trillion in 2014, is a reflection of both the high cost 
and the substantial rise in the number of students borrowing to go to school--some 41.5 million, compared 
with 22 million in 2004.

over $106,000.12  Even adjusting for family income, it appears that, on average, 

minorities make greater use of student loan debt than their white counterparts.13   

In most cases, the investments in education undertaken during the Great 

Recession will turn out to be positive over the longer term, even for individuals with 

loans to pay off.  However, there are several factors that might substantially reduce the 

expected return of some of these educational investments.  The first important 

determinant of whether an investment in education pays off is whether it leads to the 

successful completion of a degree.  Recent data suggest that fewer than 60 percent of 

students who have started a bachelor’s degree program graduate with their degree, and 

only 30 percent of those who have started an associate’s degree or certificate program 

will finish their degree.14  The Federal Reserve’s 2013 Survey of Household Economics 

and Decisionmaking (SHED) indicated that students who had not completed a degree 

consider the cost of the education not to have been worth the investment by significantly 

larger margins than those who had.15   

                                                 
12 See Sandy Baum, Diane Cardenas Elliott, and Jennifer Ma (2014), Trends in Student Aid 2014 (New 
York:  College Board), http://trends.collegeboard.org/student-aid. 
13 For example, among families earning between $60,000 and $99,999, 76 percent of African American 
bachelor’s degree recipients graduate with student loan debt, compared with 66 percent of Hispanic 
graduates and 64 percent of white graduates.  See Sandy Baum and Patricia Steele (2010), “Who Borrows 
Most?  Bachelor’s Degree Recipients with High Levels of Student Debt,” Trends in Higher Education 
Series (New York:  College Board), https://trends.collegeboard.org/sites/default/files/trends-2010-who-

14 Bachelor’s degree graduation rates are within six-year graduation rates for the 2007 entering cohort.  
Associate’s degree and certificate completion rates are for within 150 percent of normal completion time 
for the 2007 entering cohort.  See table 326.10 and table 326.20 in the “Digest of Education Statistics”

A second important determinant is the type of educational program, as there is 

wide variation in rates of return across different programs.  For example, recent research 

has shown that for-profit colleges, on average, tend to provide a lower rate of return for 

educational investment than public or not-for-profit colleges and universities.  Young 

adults who attended for-profit colleges are also more likely to default on their student 

loans, even after completing four or more years of education.16  Unfortunately, the 

students who are the first in their family to attend college are more likely than others to 

attend for-profit colleges.17     

Despite the apparent lower likely average return to education at for-profit schools, 

attendance at these schools has increased faster since the financial crisis than at other 

institutions.  Attendance at for-profit schools increased over 50 percent between 2007 and 

2012--far outpacing the 10 percent growth in enrollments seen over this period at not-for-

profit and public institutions.  This rapid growth, and the fact that for-profit colleges 

disproportionately attract first-generation college students as well as students relying on 

debt to fund their education, bears careful scrutiny.18 

Overall, the added educational investments made by the Great Recession 

generation could be a positive legacy of the crisis over the long term.  But for some, the 

returns may not turn out to be worth the cost.  For this group, the burden associated with

student debt may constrain their economic opportunities for years to come.  Borrowers 

who struggle to repay student loans face special challenges because student loans cannot 

be discharged in bankruptcy, unlike other forms of household credit.19  Fortunately, 

largely because of significant policy changes, beginning in the 2008-09 school year, the 

vast majority of student loans have been originated directly by the federal government 

and have flexible repayment and deferment options.20  Nonetheless, high levels of student 

indebtedness appear to be one factor influencing the Great Recession generation’s slow 

progression into homeownership. 

Household Formation and Homeownership 

Sharply lower household formation and homeownership rates are among the most 

striking legacies of the Great Recession, distinct from earlier recessions.  The number of 

households formed each year dropped by more than half, from about 1.35 million in the 

early and middle 2000s to about 600,000 households per year after 2007.  Moreover, the 

fraction of young adults who own homes also fell substantially:  After peaking at 

                                                 
19 11 U.S. Code § 523(a)(8) prevents education debt from being discharged in bankruptcy unless the debtor 
proves that paying the debt would “impose an undue hardship on the debtor and the debtor’s dependents.”  
For the complete 11 U.S. Code § 523(a)(8), see the U.S. Government Publishing Office website at 
www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/USCODE-2011-title11/USCODE-2011-title11-chap5-subchapII-sec523. 
20 The Great Recession also affected the way students borrowed to pay for college as private lenders 
tightened underwriting standards.  Private lenders originated more than $20 billion in student loans during 
the 2007-08 academic year.  However, that figure fell to about $9.4 billion in the following year and 
reached just $5.6 billion in the 2010-11 academic year.  During that same period, total federal loans 
originated increased from $49 billion to $76 billion.  Federal student loan programs also changed 
significantly during this time.  In 2010, the Congress eliminated the Federal Family Education Loan 
Program, which provided a federal guarantee for student loans originated by private lenders, leading to a 
sharp increase in the number of students borrowing directly from the U.S. Department of Education 
through the Federal Direct Loan Program.  In 2012, the Obama Administration created the Pay As You 
Earn program, which caps loan payments at 10 percent of discretionary income for eligible borrowers.  The 
following year, the Congress changed the method for determining Direct Loan interest rates--switching 
from a rate set by statute to a rate pegged to the 10-year Treasury note plus a markup.

22 percent in 2005, the overall rate of homeownership among young people fell to 

16 percent in 2014.21 

The combination of high educational debt levels and poor job market prospects 

faced by young adults entering the workforce in the aftermath of the financial crisis are 

the most likely causes of these sharp declines.22  Indeed, the share of adults under 

30 living with parents or other family members rose significantly in the wake of the 

financial crisis and has remained at a high level.23  The SHED found that, among 

individuals who live with their extended family or with roommates, over half are doing 

so to save money, and nearly three-fourths would move out on their own if they could 

afford to do so.  Federal Reserve research also indicates that debt is an important 

determinant of whether a young person lives with their parents, even after controlling for 

labor and housing market conditions.24  That analysis also indicates that credit 

delinquency and lower credit scores increase the propensity for adult children to move 

home as well as the length of time that young people live with their parents.   

                                                 
21 For those young adults who have formed a household, the rate of homeownership increased by about 
6 percentage points from 1995 to 2005, peaking at 37 percent in 2005, and has subsequently fallen sharply 
to below 30 percent today.  The data consist of Board staff calculations using the Census Bureau’s 
household vacancy survey.

23 In 1980, 36 percent of adults who were age 30 and younger lived with older family members.  That 
fraction gradually trended up through the early 2000s, then increased sharply to more than 45 percent by 
2012 and has not appreciably declined since then.  The data consist of Board staff calculations using the 
Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey.

However, it is possible that, even after improving economic prospects help young 

people overcome these impediments and boost household formation rates, 

homeownership rates among the Great Recession generation could lag.  Young people’s 

attitudes toward homebuying may have changed as a result of witnessing their parents’ 

experiences during the housing crisis.  Instead of seeing homeownership as a reliably safe 

investment, many of today’s young adults may now see some risk that houses could 

become financial albatrosses due to events beyond their control.  If this is the case, the 

Great Recession cohort may be slower to buy a home than previous cohorts, even after 

meeting their pre-recession career and earnings expectations.  Indeed, research suggests 

that dramatic economic events, such as the Great Depression, can have a significant 

effect on individuals’ risk-taking over their lifetime.25 

Moreover, there is some evidence that today’s young people have a skeptical view 

of the wisdom of buying a home as a result of the housing crisis.  The percentage of 

renters in the 18-to-34 age group who thought housing was a safe investment dropped 

significantly from 2003 to the first quarter of this year, from 85 percent to 59 percent, 

respectively.26  Of course, it is premature to conclude that the financial crisis has 

permanently altered young people’s attitudes toward housing investments, and several 

surveys indicate that young people continue to express a desire to become homeowners 

someday.   

                                                 
25 See Ulrike Malmendier and Stefan Nagel (2009), “Depression Babies:  Do Macroeconomic Experiences 
Affect Risk-Taking?” NBER Working Paper Series 14813 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of 
Economic Research, March). 
26 The data are from results of the Fannie Mae National Housing Survey, which were provided directly to 
the Federal Reserve.  The relevant survey question asked respondents, “Do you think homeownership is a 
safe investment (with a lot of potential or very little potential) or a risky investment (with very little 
potential or a lot of potential)?” 


 - 11 - 

Nonetheless, if the decline in homeownership among young people proves 

persistent, the implications for asset building for the future could be of concern, since 

homeownership remains an important avenue for accumulating wealth, particularly for 

those with limited means.  Even after taking into account the risks associated with 

homeownership that were brought into sharp focus by the financial crisis, there is still a 

strong case that homeownership positively contributes to household balance sheets.27  

The benefit is largely due to the forced savings associated with homeownership--not just 

for the down payment, but also for the regular monthly paydown of principal.  While 

renters could, in theory, save and invest money on a monthly basis to achieve a similar 

result, the evidence suggests most do not.  

Moreover, study after study has shown that homeownership positively contributes 

to the wealth accumulation of lower-income and minority households, albeit in smaller 

amounts than for higher-income and white households.28  This finding is particularly 

important because housing also accounts for the majority of the assets held by these 

households.  Lower-income and minority renters, on the other hand, have been found to 

accrue little or no wealth over time.29

The Great Recession Generation and Economic Mobility 

Today’s young people are the fulcrum of the economic mobility agenda.  Those 

who have come of age in the shadow of the Great Recession have experienced substantial 

risks and faced daunting challenges in establishing themselves independently in their 

work lives and their home lives.  By studying these effects and the actions that can 

support the resilience of the Great Recession generation, we will strengthen not only 

today’s recovery, but also the opportunities facing tomorrow’s children. 

So it is particularly heartening that, despite the challenges of coming of age in the 

Great Recession, today’s young adults--including minorities--remain optimistic about 

their future.30  The challenge for practitioners and the research community is to deliver 

on this youthful optimism through policies and opportunities that promote strong and 

equitable economic growth. 

The Federal Open Market Committee has been playing an important role by 

pursuing policies aimed at achieving maximum employment in the context of price 

stability.  Monetary policy has remained accommodative over an extended period, which 

has supported labor market recovery--with significant improvement in overall 

unemployment, increases in job openings, and recent declines in underemployment--

while inflation has remained below its target.  In addition, the Federal Reserve System, 

through its research and analysis of economic data, provides important insights on the 

dynamics of the labor market, investments in education, and the housing sector.

The community development staff at the Board and the 12 Federal Reserve 

Banks--the organizers of this conference--complement traditional research with applied 

field research and outreach.  Before wrapping up, I want to touch briefly on a handful of 

the System’s many community development initiatives that focus on the post-crisis needs 

of young people.   

The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland recently published an analysis of 

employment and education patterns for non-college-bound workers in the Fourth
