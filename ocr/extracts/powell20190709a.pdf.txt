Good morning everyone and thank you to President Rosengren and the Boston 

Fed for hosting this conference. 

The Federal Reserve is strongly committed to stress testing as a cornerstone of 

our bank supervisory and financial stability missions.  Stress testing is perhaps the most 

successful supervisory innovation of the post-crisis era.  But if stress tests are to 

continue to serve their critical function, they will need to evolve in the years ahead to 

keep pace with the ever-changing financial system, as they have since the first round of 

tests in 2009.   

Before looking to the future, let me recall a bit of history.  A little more than 

10 years ago, the United States and the world teetered on the brink of economic 

catastrophe.  What was urgently needed was a way to restore confidence in the financial 

system—a daunting challenge.  Neither the banks, nor the regulators, nor the public had a 

reliable sense of the strength and resilience of our major banks.  The announcement of 

forward-looking stress-testing results in May 2009 helped restore confidence and 

stabilize banks by providing a credible and independent picture of their finances.1  These 

original stress tests evolved into the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or 

CCAR, program, which has served to institutionalize capital planning by firms, and 

supervision by the Fed, as a forward-looking endeavor. 

                                                 
1 The stress tests were announced in February 2009, and the results were released in May 2009.  See, 
respectively, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision (2009), “Agencies to Begin 
Forward-Looking Economic Assessments,” joint press release, February 25,

Since 2009, large banks have added more than $800 billion in common equity 

capital, giving them a much thicker cushion to deal with losses.  Banks have gotten much 

better at assessing and managing their risks, effectively tracking commitments across 

their organizations, anticipating capital needs, and planning for different scenarios. 

The stress tests of the future—5 and 10 years from now—will need to continue to 

ensure that banks remain able, even in a severe downturn, to provide the credit that 

households and businesses depend on.  As financial institutions and the financial system 

evolve, stress testing will need to keep up.  When the next episode of financial instability 

presents itself, it may do so in a messy and unexpected way.  Banks will need to be ready 

not just for expected risks, but for unexpected ones.  Thus, the tests will need to vary 

from year to year, and to explore even quite unlikely scenarios. 

If the stress tests do not evolve, they risk becoming a compliance exercise, 

breeding complacency from both supervisors and banks.  We might also, inadvertently, 

encourage the development of a banking system where, over time, all banks would look 

much alike rather than the banking system we want and need, one with diverse 

institutions with different business models.  We simply can’t let these things happen. 

The purpose of today’s gathering is to help us think about how to ensure the tests 

continue to foster a dynamic banking system, financial stability, and a healthy and 

growing economy.  We have invited a wide range participants—fellow regulators, 

bankers, analysts, academics, and community groups—with diverse perspectives.  

Because we do not claim a monopoly on knowledge or wisdom, we have invited many 

who have disagreed with us in the past.  I strongly believe that diverse perspectives and 

healthy debate will sharpen our thinking and lead us to better answers.

I’m sorry I’m not able to be with you today.  And I want to particularly thank all 

of the speakers, discussants, and other participants for helping us grapple with the 

challenges of ensuring that tomorrow’s stress tests remain as effective and vigorous as 

they are today.  Thank you.
