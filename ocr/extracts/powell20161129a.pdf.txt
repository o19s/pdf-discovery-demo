Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  My plan is to discuss the U.S. 

economy from three different perspectives.  I will start by taking stock of the current 

expansion--a business cycle point of view.  Then I will shift the focus to some of the 

longer-term challenges we face in coming years.  I will conclude with a discussion of 

monetary policy.  As always, the views I express here today are mine alone. 

The Current State of the Economy 

As you know, the Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable 

prices and maximum employment--the dual mandate.  Today, we are not far from 

achieving those goals.   

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has an objective of 2 percent for 

inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures.  The Committee sees this objective as symmetrical, so that minor 

deviations above or below 2 percent are treated alike.1  Inflation has consistently run 

below 2 percent since 2011, and is now at 1.2 percent over the past 12 months (figure 1).  

This headline measure of inflation has recently been held down by falling energy and 

food prices.  We also monitor core inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food 

components because they often send a misleading signal about underlying inflation 

pressures.  Core inflation is running at 1.7 percent over the past 12 months.  Both 

measures have gradually moved upward toward 2 percent. 

U.S. inflation trended steadily lower after the Volcker disinflation of 1981 to 1982 

and has been low and reasonably stable for many years.  In fact, for the past several years 

inflation has run below policy targets in many parts of the world, including here in the

United States.  Many of us are old enough to remember when the only challenge was to 

keep inflation low.  But too-low inflation can also be a serious problem.  Below-target 

inflation increases the real value of debts owed by households and businesses and reduces 

the ability of central banks to respond to downturns.     

The public’s expectations about inflation are thought to be an important driver of 

actual inflation.  Many measures of U.S. inflation expectations--both from surveys and 

from market-based readings--are still well below their pre-crisis levels, although some 

have moved up as of late.  The only way to ensure that inflation expectations remain 

safely anchored near the FOMC’s target is to keep inflation close to that target on a 

consistent basis.  So, while the current shortfall may seem small, it is important that 

inflation continue to move up to 2 percent, as I expect it will. 

The FOMC does not have a numerical goal for maximum employment because 

the long-run sustainable level of employment changes over time and is determined 

mainly by nonmonetary factors that are outside the Fed’s control, such as evolving labor 

market practices, demographics, social change, and fiscal and regulatory policies.  

Nonetheless, four times each year FOMC participants write down their estimates of the 

longer-run normal level of the unemployment rate (the natural rate); at the September 

FOMC meeting the median estimate was 4.8 percent, very close to the current 

unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. 

  Other labor market measures are also healthy, including payroll job creation and 

labor force participation.  Employers have been adding roughly 180,000 jobs per month 

so far this year--a pace a little below that of the past several years but significantly higher 

than underlying growth in the labor force (figure 2).  Despite these strong job gains, the 


 - 3 - 

unemployment rate has flattened out this year after several years of sharp declines, thanks 

to welcome developments in labor force participation (figure 3).   

The labor force participation rate represents the percentage of adults aged 16 and 

over who are in the labor force, which is defined to include only those who are employed 

or actively looking for work.  When people enter or reenter the labor force and begin to 

search for a job, that is generally a good thing even though at the margin their entry tends 

to increase the unemployment rate (or prevent it from declining).  Beginning in the 

1960s, labor force participation rose steadily as women entered the paid workforce 

(figure 4).  That trend ran its course as participation peaked around 2000 and has declined 

steadily since then as a result of the aging of our population and other longer-run trends, 

notably the decline in participation by men in the heart of their working-age years.  Going 

forward, many analysts expect labor force participation to decline at a trend rate of 

roughly 0.3 percent per year as a result of these factors.  However, participation fell much 

more sharply than that after the financial crisis.  Some of those who left the labor force 

went back to school, but others moved onto disability, took early retirement, or just 

became discouraged and stopped seeking work.  The sharp drop raised fears that the 

crisis might leave behind permanent damage to our labor force.  Fortunately, since late 

2013, the participation rate has remained about flat and thus has gradually moved back 

close to its estimated longer-term trend.2  On net, people have been entering and 

remaining in the labor market as job prospects have brightened, offsetting the natural 

decline from population aging.   

                                                 
2 The current participation rate is within the range of estimates cited in Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, 
Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force 
Participation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall,  
pp. 197-275, www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.

Surveys of households and firms also suggest that we are near full employment 

(figure 5).  For example, respondents are now more likely to say that jobs are plentiful 

than that they are hard to get--a response that has generally been seen when the economy 

is near full employment.  Job vacancies are running at high levels, and firms report that it 

is getting harder to find employees to fill open positions.  Moreover, wages are now 

rising faster than inflation, and faster than output per hour.  Taken together, labor market 

indicators show an economy that is on solid footing and close to our mandate of 

maximum employment. 

 It is interesting to compare this expansion to past U.S. expansions, and also to 

recoveries of other countries since the end of the Global Financial Crisis.  The picture is a 

mixed one.  The current recovery has been under way since June 2009--nearly seven and 

a half years.  It will soon be the third longest of the 20 recoveries since the founding of 

the Federal Reserve in 1913.  GDP, or output, is now 11 percent higher than its pre-crisis 

peak.  Employment is now 6.5 million higher than its pre-crisis peak.     

But this expansion has also had the slowest pace of GDP growth of any postwar 

recovery (figure 6).  Given steady but modest growth, we have seen surprisingly large 

gains in employment and, until this year, a rapid reduction in the unemployment rate.  

Even though GDP growth has been slow, job gains during this recovery have been 

stronger than those during the previous expansion--the so-called jobless recovery of the 

early 2000s.  The combination of weak growth and strong hiring in this expansion 

implies small increases in output per hour, or productivity.  In fact, productivity has been 

increasing at a dismal pace, compared with virtually any period in the postwar era.  I will 

return to productivity and growth in a moment. 


 - 5 - 

More positively, our current recovery compares fairly well with those of other 

advanced economies (figure 7).  Output has increased faster, and unemployment has 

declined faster, in the United States than in other major advanced economies.  And the 

Fed’s challenges in getting inflation back up to 2 percent are similar to, but not as severe 

as, those faced by some other major monetary authorities.  

Turning to the near-term outlook, after a slow patch in the first half of this year, 

growth has clearly strengthened.  I expect that the economy will continue on its path of 

the last few years, with real GDP growth of about 2 percent, strong job gains, a tightening 

labor market, and inflation moving up toward our 2 percent objective.  The main risks I 

see to that outlook are from abroad.  Growth and inflation are low around the world.  

With interest rates so low, we are not well positioned to respond to negative shocks, 

whatever the source.   

Longer-Run Challenges 

Productivity and Growth 

Let’s turn to longer-run challenges, and start by asking why growth has been so 

slow, and how fast we are likely to grow going forward.  This next slide shows the five-

year trailing average annual real GDP growth rate (figure 8).  By this measure, growth 

averaged about 3.2 percent annually through the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s.  But 

growth began to decline after 2000 and then nose-dived with the onset of the Global 

Financial Crisis in 2007 and the slow expansion that followed.  Since the financial crisis 

ended in 2009, forecasters have gradually reduced their estimates of long-run trend 


 - 6 - 

growth from about 3 percent to about 2 percent--a seemingly small difference that would 

make a huge difference in living standards over time.3 

How much of this decline is just a particularly bad business cycle, and how much 

represents a long-run downshift?  To get at that question, let’s take a deeper look at the 

growth slowdown.  We can think of economic growth as coming from two sources:  more 

hours worked (labor supply) or higher output per hour (productivity).  Hours worked 

mainly depends on growth in the labor force, which has been slowing since the mid-

2000s as the baby-boom generation ages.  As you can see, the labor force is now growing 

at only about 0.5 percent per year (figure 9).  Another way to see this is through the 

sustained increase in the ratio of people over 65 to those who are in their prime working 

years (figure 10).  This long-expected demographic fact has now arrived, and it has 

challenging implications for our potential growth and also for our fiscal policy.4 

The unexpected part of the growth slowdown reflects weak productivity growth 

rather than lower labor supply.  Labor productivity has increased only 1/2 percent per 

year since 2010--the smallest five-year rate of increase since World War II and about 

one-fourth of the average postwar rate (figure 11).  The slowdown in productivity has 

been worldwide and is evident even in countries that were little affected by the crisis 

(figure 12).  Given the global nature of the phenomenon, it is unlikely that U.S.-specific 

factors are mainly responsible.

A portion of the productivity slowdown is undoubtedly due to low levels of 

investment by businesses.  The financial crisis and the Great Recession left firms with 

excess capacity, reducing incentives to invest.  If businesses expect slower growth to 

continue, that will also hold down investment.   

The other important factor is the decline in what economists call total factor 

productivity, or TFP, which is the part of productivity that is not explained by capital 

investment or increases in the skills of the labor force.  TFP is thought to be mainly a 

function of technological innovation and efficiency gains.   

There is no consensus about the future direction of productivity.5  The pessimists 

argue that the big paradigm-changing innovations, such as electrification or the advent of 

computers, are behind us.  If that is so, then our standard of living will increase more 

slowly going forward.  The optimists think that this slowdown is only a passing phase 

and that the age of robots and machine learning will transform our economy in coming 

decades.  Still others argue that we are currently underestimating productivity and output 

because of the real difficulties we face in measuring GDP in a modern economy.  For 

example, how do we measure the value-added of free digital services like Facebook or 

Twitter?6 

The future is, as always, uncertain.  But I would sum up the growth discussion as 

follows.  Growth in the labor force has slowed, and we can estimate it with reasonable 

                                                 
5 On the pessimistic end of the spectrum are analysts such as Robert Gordon, The Rise and Fall of 
American Growth:  The U.S. Standard of Living since the Civil War (Princeton University Press, 2016).  
Among the optimists are Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee, The Second Machine Age:  Work, 
Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (W. W. Norton & Company, 2014).

problem.

confidence to be only about 0.5 percent.  Growth in productivity is both more important 

and much harder to predict.  Productivity varies significantly over time, as figure 11 

showed.  If productivity growth returns to, say, 1.5 percent, then the U.S. economy could 

grow at about 2.0 percent over the long term.  Actual growth may turn out to be weaker 

or stronger, and the choices we make as a society will have something to say about that.    

Why Are Long-Term Interest Rates So Low? 

Let’s turn to the related question of why long-term interest rates are so 

extraordinarily low in advanced economies around the world.  The yield on our own 

benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury security has increased lately, but at 2.3 percent it is still 

far below what was normal before the financial crisis.  In fact, this next chart shows that, 

as growth and inflation have fallen, longer term interest rates have fallen as well over the 

past 35 years (figure 13).  

So why are long-term interest rates so low?  Many of you will no doubt be 

thinking, “They are low because you people at the Fed set them low!”  While there is an 

element of truth there, that is not the whole story.  The FOMC has considerable control 

over short-term interest rates.  We have much less influence over long-term rates, which 

are set in the marketplace.  Long-term interest rates represent the price that balances the 

supply of saving by lenders and demand for funds by borrowers, such as businesses 

needing to fund their capital expenditures.  Lenders expect to receive a real return and to 

be compensated for inflation and for the risk of nonpayment.  Meanwhile, borrowers 

adjust their demand for funds based on their changing assessment of the risks and 

expected returns of their investment projects.  When desired saving rises or investment 


 - 9 - 

demand falls, then long-term interest rates will decline.  Today’s very low level of long-

term rates suggests that both of these factors are at play.   

   Both expectations of slower growth and the aging of our population are having 

significant effects on desired saving and investment and are thus important causes of 

lower interest rates.  If the economy is expanding more slowly, then the level of 

investment needed to meet demand will be lower.  The lower path of growth reduces 

future income prospects of households, and they will tend to raise their saving.  The 

pending retirement of baby boomers means higher saving, because people tend to save 

the most in the years just before their retirement.  In addition, the lower rate of return on 

capital owing to lower productivity growth will lead to less investment and lower interest 

rates. 

As with productivity, the factors behind the fall in U.S. interest rates include an 

important global component, as rates are low around the world.  Indeed, although our 

rates are near historical lows, U.S. Treasury rates are among the highest among the major 

advanced economy sovereigns (figure 14).    

Is This the New Normal? 

What can we do to prevent low growth, low inflation, and low interest rates from 

becoming the new normal?  We need to focus on ways to increase our long-term growth 

and spread that prosperity as broadly as possible.  I hasten to add that these policies are, 

for the most part, outside the purview of the Federal Reserve.  We need policies that 

support productivity growth, business hiring and investment, labor force participation, 

and the development of skills.  We need effective fiscal and regulatory policies that 

inspire public confidence.  Increased spending on public infrastructure may raise private-


 - 10 - 

sector productivity over time, particularly with the growth of the stock of public 

infrastructure near an all-time low.7  Greater support for public and private research and 

development, and policies that improve product and labor market dynamism may also be 

fruitful.8  Monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable expansion 

in a context of price stability.     

Monetary Policy 

The low interest rate environment presents special challenges for monetary 

policy.  In setting our target for the federal funds rate, a good place to start is to identify 

the rate that would prevail if the economy were at 2 percent inflation and full 

employment--the so-called neutral rate.  “Neutral” in this context means that the rate is 

neither contractionary nor expansionary.  If the fed funds rate is lower than the neutral 

rate, then policy is stimulative or accommodative, which will tend to raise growth and 

inflation.  If the fed funds rate is higher than the neutral rate, then policy is tight and will 

tend to slow growth and reduce inflation.   

But we can only estimate the neutral rate, and those estimates are subject to 

substantial uncertainty.  Before the crisis, the long-run neutral rate was generally thought 

to be roughly stable at around 4.25 percent.  Since the crisis, estimates have steadily

Right for an Infrastructure Push,” World Economic Outlook (Washington:  International Monetary Fund,

declined, and the median estimate by FOMC participants stood at 2.9 percent in 

September.  Many analysts believe that the neutral rate is even lower than that today and 

will only return to its long-run value over time.9  The low level of the neutral interest rate 

has several important implications.  First, today’s low rates are not as stimulative as they 

seem--consider that, despite historically low rates, inflation has run consistently below 

target and housing construction remains far below pre-crisis levels.  Second, with rates so 

low, central banks are not well positioned to counteract a renewed bout of weakness.  

Third, persistently low interest rates can raise financial stability concerns.  A long period 

of very low interest rates could lead to excessive risk-taking and, over time, to 

unsustainably high asset prices and credit growth.  These are risks that we monitor 

carefully.  Higher growth would increase the neutral rate and help address these issues. 

Turning to the outlook for monetary policy, incoming data show an economy that 

is growing at a healthy pace, with solid payroll job gains and inflation gradually moving 

up to 2 percent.  In my view, the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has clearly 

strengthened since our previous meeting earlier this month.  Of course, the path of rates 

will depend on the path of the economy.  With inflation below target, relatively slow 

growth, and some slack remaining in the economy, the Committee has been patient about 

raising rates.  That patience has paid dividends.  But moving too slowly could eventually 

mean that the Committee would have to tighten policy abruptly to avoid overshooting our 

goals.

Conclusion 

 To wrap up, since the end of the Great Recession in 2009, our economy has 

recovered slowly but steadily.  Today, we are reasonably close to achieving full 

employment and our 2 percent inflation objective.  But we face real challenges over the 

medium and longer terms.  Our aging population will mean slower growth, all else held 

equal.  If living standards are to continue to rise, we need policies that will support 

productivity and allow our dynamic economy to generate widespread gains in prosperity.
