Supervisory stress testing has become a cornerstone of post-crisis prudential regulation.  

Stress testing, unlike traditional capital requirements, provides a forward-looking assessment of 

losses that would be suffered under adverse economic scenarios.  The simultaneous testing of the 

largest firms lends a perspective on a large part of the banking system and facilitates 

identification of common exposures and risks.   

During the financial crisis, the success of an ad hoc stress test in assessing the capital 

needs of, and restoring confidence in, the nation’s largest financial institutions encouraged 

Congress to make stress testing a required and regular feature of large firm prudential 

regulation.1  The Federal Reserve has, in the succeeding years, substantially refined its 

supervisory stress test.  Moreover, the stress test has been integrated into our Comprehensive 

Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), which both ties the results of the test into the banks’ 

capital distribution practices and evaluates their risk management and capital planning capacities.   

Today I want to share with you the results of an extensive review of the statutory stress 

test and CCAR programs, which we began following the end of the 2015 cycle.  Before turning 

to the reasons for that review and some ideas for changing these programs that have arisen from 

it, I will take a few moments to summarize the characteristics and purposes of the programs as 

they have evolved to this point. 

Stress Testing and CCAR Today 

 As we have implemented the requirement mandated by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) for stress testing--which the Federal 

Reserve denominates as the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (DFAST)--that exercise includes four

main steps.2  (1) The firms subject to DFAST provide the Federal Reserve with detailed, 

significantly standardized data on their loans, securities holdings, trading positions, counterparty 

exposures, revenue, expenses, and balance sheets.  (2) The Federal Reserve specifies 

hypothetical macroeconomic and financial market scenarios--including an “adverse” and a 

“severely adverse” scenario.  (3) The Federal Reserve inputs the data from the firms into its own 

supervisory models to project each firm’s losses, revenues, and capital over a nine-quarter 

planning horizon under the specified scenarios.  (4) The results of the exercise, including the 

capital positions of the firms following the hypothesized stress scenarios, are disclosed to the 

public. 

As DFAST has evolved, it has become an increasingly valuable tool for evaluating 

whether the largest financial firms are holding sufficient capital to continue providing credit in 

the event of significant macroeconomic and financial stress.  However, in itself DFAST does not 

set any capital ratios or limit any capital actions by the firms.  Those functions are implemented 

through the CCAR program, which was created through the regulatory process by the Federal 

Reserve.3  In CCAR, the Federal Reserve assesses the overall capital adequacy of the firms--

including evaluations of whether each firm’s capital provides an adequate buffer for the losses 

that would be incurred during the stress scenarios, whether its risk management and capital 

planning processes are appropriately well-developed and governed, and how its plans to 

distribute capital through dividends or share repurchases could affect its ability to remain a 

viable financial intermediary in the hypothesized scenarios.  Given how central these 

                                                 
2 For a more complete description of the Federal Reserve’s DFAST and CCAR programs, see 
www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm.  As a formal matter, DFAST was 
implemented beginning in 2013.  However, in 2011 and 2012, the Federal Reserve conducted supervisory stress 
tests as part of its CCAR program, as explained later in the text.

considerations are to effective risk management and the soundness of these firms, we are 

progressively integrating the qualitative elements of CCAR into our year-round supervisory 

program for the largest banking organizations.  

Under CCAR, the Federal Reserve may object to a firm’s capital plan on either 

quantitative or qualitative grounds.  A quantitative objection is made when the stress test reveals 

that a firm would not be able to maintain its post-stress capital ratios above the regulatory 

minimum levels over the planning horizon, taking into account its planned capital distributions.  

We have taken planned distributions into account because, as the run-up to the financial crisis 

revealed, firms may be reluctant to cut their distributions--particularly dividends--even in a 

period of growing stress.  Thus, CCAR included what has been called a “pre-funding” 

requirement. 

The Federal Reserve may object on qualitative grounds if it finds that the firm’s capital 

planning processes are not sufficiently reliable.  The qualitative assessment includes the 

assumptions and analyses underlying each firm’s capital plan, its controls and governance 

processes, and whether previously identified weaknesses in management and operations have 

been corrected.  If the Federal Reserve objects on quantitative or qualitative grounds, the firm 

may not make any capital distributions without our permission.  In practice, in the case of a 

qualitative objection, we have generally permitted distributions at the previous year’s level but 

no increases.  This practice, however, has been in the context of distributions rising from 

generally low levels coming out of the crisis; there has been no guarantee that a similar practice 

would prevail as distributions continue rising. 

 The quantitative component of CCAR, based as it is on the DFAST stress tests, has 

contributed to the continued strengthening of the capital levels of the largest financial institutions

that began after the original stress test in the winter of 2009.4  While, understandably, many 

focus on the quantitative side and its implications for capital distributions, the importance of the 

qualitative component has been perhaps underappreciated.  We saw during the 2009 stress test 

that many large financial institutions were unable to marshal the data necessary to gauge their 

own exposures accurately or to project the adverse effects they would suffer in a tail event, as 

opposed to a more ordinary cyclical downturn.  CCAR has required the firms to steadily improve 

their risk management and capital planning processes.  Indeed, some of the firms--particularly 

the less complex banks within the CCAR cohort--are now meeting, or are close to meeting, our 

supervisory expectations across a range of risk management and capital planning processes.  

The CCAR Review 

Clearly, then, we regard the stress testing and CCAR programs to have made substantial 

contributions to protecting the safety and soundness of the nation’s largest financial firms and to 

promoting the stability of the financial system as a whole.  But, equally clearly, if a stress testing 

regime is to continue to play this role, it must be dynamic.  The hypothesized scenarios must 

change to take account of new economic and financial risks.  The supervisory model may, in 

some circumstances, need to be changed to take account of evolving economic conditions and 

bank portfolio characteristics.  Additionally, we have been refining the stress testing and CCAR 

processes in what is, of course, still a relatively new regulatory and supervisory tool.  Changes of 

all these kinds have been, and will continue to be, made from year to year.

holding companies in the 2016 CCAR has more than doubled from 5.5 percent in the first quarter of 2009 to 12.2 
percent in the first quarter of 2016.  This reflects an increase of more than $700 billion in common equity capital to a 
total of $1.2 trillion during the same period.  www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20160629a.htm.

After five years of post-crisis stress testing, however, we believed it was important for us 

to conduct a more thorough assessment of the program.  Taking advantage of the shift in timing 

of the annual stress tests following the 2015 cycle, we undertook an overall review.5  We knew 

there were several areas to which attention was needed.  These included the imperfect alignment 

of CCAR with the regulatory capital requirements as they had evolved since we began stress 

testing, the desire for additional macroprudential elements in the stress test, and the qualitative 

component of CCAR as it applied to less complex firms.   

But we also wanted to hear what others thought.  Accordingly, we met with bank 

officials, debt and equity-side market analysts, public interest groups, and academics--both to 

solicit their views on the topics I noted a moment ago and to hear their overall evaluation of, and 

recommendations for, our stress testing and CCAR exercises.  As you can imagine, we received 

a wide range of suggestions, at least some of which were inconsistent with one another.  In the 

main, though, these discussions reflected strong support for stress testing, reinforced our going-

in view of the key issues for consideration, and presented us with some other areas for possible 

change.  Before describing the package of potential changes that is emerging from our review, let 

me explain a bit more about each of the key topics. 

First is the fact that CCAR has been adjusted to align with some, but not all, of the 

important changes made in our regulatory capital rules over the past six years.6  One might 

decide that the regulatory capital rules and CCAR should be different, complementary capital 

measures, roughly the way that a leverage ratio requirement and risk-weighted capital 

                                                 
5 The 2016 CCAR cycle started one quarter later than past years’ CCAR cycles.   
6 For example, our regulatory capital rules now include a minimum requirement based on common equity, reflecting 
the fact that common equity provides the best buffer against losses. As a result, the similar common equity 
requirement that had been included in the early years of CCAR, to meet an additional post-stress target ratio of tier 1 
common equity, was removed after CCAR 2015. Other changes that have been integrated into the stress test include 
modification of the risk-weighted asset calculation methodologies and revised definitions of capital. 



6 
 

requirements are complementary.  In some particulars, though, CCAR sits a bit uneasily 

alongside the ongoing capital requirements.  The most notable example is that CCAR assumes 

that a firm will continue to make its planned capital distributions during a stress period even 

though the regulatory capital rules now include a capital conservation buffer to limit such 

distributions.  Another is that, to this point, CCAR has not reflected the firm-specific capital 

surcharge we have adopted for global systemically important banks (GSIBs). 

Our second key topic was the macroprudential dimension of the stress testing and CCAR 

regimes.  One of the most important lessons of the financial crisis was that prudential regulation, 

including capital regulation, had been dominantly microprudential in nature, even for the largest 

firms.  That is, the regulation was designed and applied with a view mostly to the idiosyncratic 

risks faced by a bank in isolation, without regard to the interaction of the bank and the financial 

system as a whole.  Thus, for example, capital regulation did not take account of fire sale effects-

-the reduction in portfolio values for one bank by other banks selling certain types of assets in 

order to enhance their own solvency or to counter a reduction in funding availability.  Similarly, 

microprudential capital regulation allows a bank to meet its capital ratios by reducing lending--

that is, by reducing the denominator of its ratio--as well as by increasing capital.  If many banks 

were to follow this strategy, even creditworthy borrowers would be adversely affected, thereby 

exacerbating an economic downturn.  

Our stress testing and CCAR regimes do have some macroprudential elements, which 

have been modestly enhanced over the past few years.  By conducting the stress tests for all large 

banks at the same time under common scenarios, we can evaluate the collective losses that may 

be borne by a major part of the industry in the stress scenario.  We vary scenario design to take 



7 
 

account of a variety of risks to the financial system and in a way that reduces procyclical effects.7  

We vary the market shock over time to reduce the incentive for firms to correlate their asset 

holdings or adopt correlated hedging strategies that are treated relatively favorably under one 

particular market shock scenario.  And we do not allow firms to plan on a reduction in their 

balance sheets as a way to meet capital ratio requirements under stress. 

Still, as currently conceived and implemented, our stress testing regime emphasizes the 

direct risks to bank capital from a severe recession and associated market dislocation via the 

usual channels of reduced operating revenues combined with credit, market, counterparty, and 

operational losses.  However, as noted by some academics and policy analysts, a fully developed 

macroprudential dimension to stress testing would incorporate indirect risks to bank capital 

through channels such as market-wide funding and liquidity disruptions, fire sales, and so on.8  

These amplification effects are obviously particularly important for firms that have relatively 

larger trading books or that rely relatively more on short-term funding, or both.  Indeed, many of 

the academics with whom we discussed stress testing during our review emphasized the 

importance of building out the macroprudential elements of our stress testing program. 

The third topic we had identified for review was the nature of the qualitative assessment 

as it applied to the relatively smaller, less complex firms within the CCAR exercise.  While we 

had always explicitly differentiated our risk management and capital planning expectations for 

these firms, our supervisors had observed that many such firms seemed uncertain of whether 

they would nonetheless be held to the more stringent standards intended for the largest, most

complex firms.  In the course of our review, comments from these smaller, less complex firms 

confirmed this observation.  Officials from these banks expressed the view that the CCAR 

qualitative assessment was unduly burdensome because it created pressure to develop complex 

processes, extensive documentation, and sophisticated stress test models that mirrored those in 

use at the largest, most complex firms, in order to avoid the possibility of a public objection to 

their capital plan.  Since our intention had never been to create an incentive for firms with a 

relatively small systemic footprint to invest in stress testing processes appropriate only for larger 

or more complex firms, we knew we needed to address this problem. 

Results of the Review 

After more than a year of discussions and analysis, we have developed ideas for changes 

to the stress testing and CCAR regimes that would address these three key issues, along with 

some related matters that arose during the course of our review.  Some of these changes would 

need to be pursued through rulemakings, including the usual notice-and-comment process.  

Others can be implemented through nonregulatory changes, though some will need further 

elaboration in moving from idea to concrete practice.  Thus, there is a necessarily provisional 

character to the package set forth here.  Except for the relief from the qualitative requirements 

for smaller, less complex CCAR firms--which I will describe a bit later--we do not contemplate 

proposing regulations to implement these ideas until early next year.  Thus, any such changes 

would not apply to the coming 2017 DFAST/CCAR cycle.   

Better Alignment of CCAR with the new regulatory capital rules 

As I noted earlier, there have been significant additions to regulatory capital requirements 

since the first CCAR exercise began in late 2010.  While some--such as revised risk-weighted 

asset calculation methodologies and definitions of capital--have been integrated into the stress 



9 
 

testing program, other important additions have not.  Most significant are the various capital 

buffer requirements that sit atop the regulatory minimum levels.  These include a uniform 2.5-

percent capital conservation buffer (CCB), the GSIB surcharge, and a countercyclical buffer that 

can expand the CCB for a broad range of firms in times of increasing financial vulnerabilities.9  

Firms that do not hold capital sufficient to meet or exceed this combined buffer level are subject 

to restrictions on their capital distributions and bonus payments to executives, which become 

progressively stricter as their capital level falls deeper into the buffer.  

To better align CCAR with the regulatory capital rules as they now stand, we will be 

considering adoption of a “stress capital buffer” (SCB) approach to setting post-stress capital 

requirements that would further integrate our capital rules with our stress test and CCAR 

frameworks.  The simplest way to describe it is that the SCB would replace the existing 2.5 

percent CCB as a component in each CCAR firm’s point-in-time capital requirements.  The SCB 

would be risk-sensitive and vary across firms, based on the results of the annual stress test.  

Specifically, it would be set equal to the maximum decline in a firm’s common equity tier 1 

capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario of the supervisory stress test before the inclusion 

of the firm’s planned capital distributions, a simplification from the current practice of 

calculating the capital positions of the firm separately for each quarter in the scenario horizon.   

As is now the case with the CCB and other applicable capital buffers, a firm would be 

subject to restrictions on its capital distributions whenever its capital levels fall below the 

combined regulatory minima and buffers.  Although it is likely that the stress test losses will 

continue to exceed 2.5 percent of risk-weighted assets for most GSIBs, the SCB would have a 

                                                 
9 The countercyclical buffer applies to banking organizations with more than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in 
on-balance-sheet foreign exposures and to any depository institution subsidiary of such organizations. See 12 CFR 
Part 217, Appendix A. 



10 
 

specified floor at this current CCB level to avoid any reduction in the stringency of the 

regulatory capital rules.  A firm’s buffer requirement would be recalculated after each year’s 

stress test, and its capital plan would not be approved in CCAR if the plan indicated that the firm 

would fall into the buffer under the stress test’s baseline projections.  

Let me use a hypothetical example to illustrate how the SCB would work.  Assuming that 

a firm’s common equity tier 1 capital ratio declines in CCAR’s severely adverse scenario from 

13 percent to 8 percent, that firm’s SCB would be the greater of 2.5 percent or the 5 percent 

decline--thus, 5 percent.  Assuming further that this firm is a GSIB with a surcharge of 3 percent 

and that the countercyclical buffer is not in effect, the firm would be constrained in making 

capital distributions that would bring its common equity tier 1 capital ratio under 12.5 percent.  

The 12.5 percent figure is the sum of the 4.5 percent minimum common equity tier 1 risk-

weighted capital requirement, the 3 percent surcharge, and the 5 percent stress loss as calculated 

in annual stress test.10 

Because the GSIB capital surcharge already exists as an additional buffer requirement in 

the regulatory capital rules, the stress capital buffer approach would effectively add the GSIB 

capital surcharge to our estimates of the amount of capital needed under stress.  This would 

generally result in a significant increase in capital requirements applicable to the GSIBs, for most 

of which CCAR has been their binding capital constraint.  But having both the stress loss buffer 

and the capital surcharge included in our capital requirements is wholly consistent with the 

reasons for having a capital surcharge in the first place.  Indeed, not having the two together has 

actually been an anomaly that arose from the sequencing of the various capital strengthening 

measures we have undertaken.   

                                                 
10 Figure 1 further illustrates the stress capital buffer.  



11 
 

The Board adopted the GSIB surcharge requirement as part of its implementation of 

section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which established the important macroprudential principle 

that financial firms should be subject to increasingly stringent regulation as their systemic 

importance increases.  As explained in more detail in the white paper that accompanied the 

Board’s final GSIB risk-based capital surcharge rule,11 the material distress or failure of a GSIB 

would have an adverse impact on the financial system as a whole that is far greater than the 

impact on the financial system of the distress or failure of a non-GSIB banking firm. 

Accordingly, GSIBs should face capital surcharges to compel internalization of those external 

costs.  This should reduce the probability of a GSIB’s failure enough below that of a non-GSIB 

that the expected impact on the system of a GSIB and a non-GSIB failure are more comparable. 

Because the difference in the external costs of the distress or failure of a GSIB as 

compared to a non-GSIB is likely to be at least as high during times of macroeconomic and 

financial market stress as during ordinary times, there is no reason why the GSIB surcharge 

should not be a part of the post-stress capital regime.  A complementary point is that the extra 

buffer required by the GSIB surcharge also reflects the fact that even the best-conceived annual 

stress scenarios cannot capture all tail risks in the financial system.  The integration of capital 

rules and the stress test thus advances our second aim in initiating our CCAR review--the 

incorporation of more macroprudential elements. 

As some of you may know, Chair Yellen and I have, on a number of occasions over the 

past year or so, indicated publicly that we would be considering the effective incorporation of the 

surcharge into post-stress capital expectations.  Some industry representatives have subsequently 

argued that this step is not warranted.  While we will of course address these and other comments

(Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, July 20). 



12 
 

as our rulemaking process moves forward, I want to comment now on a couple of arguments, 

since they seem to reflect a misunderstanding of our stress testing program or of the regulatory 

structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act. 

One such argument is that it is duplicative to include both the anticipated losses under 

stress and the GSIB surcharge in a firm’s capital requirement because two elements of our 

current stress test, the global market shock and the counterparty default shock, only apply to 

GSIB firms.  However, these additional scenario components capture direct losses to which any 

firm engaged in material trading activity is exposed.  The market shock measures the trading 

mark-to-market losses associated with sudden changes in asset prices.  The large counterparty 

default measures the losses associated with repricing counterparty exposures based on the market 

shock, and then assuming the default of the counterparty that represents the largest net exposure.  

These components of the stress test do not capture the adverse impact of a GSIB failure on the 

financial system as a whole--the risks that are the basis for the GSIB surcharge.  

These components of our stress test currently apply only to GSIBs because GSIBs are the 

only firms currently in CCAR for which these exposures are material.  Non-GSIBs currently do 

not have material trading activities and so would suffer only small direct trading losses as a result 

of severely stressed market conditions or the failure of a major derivatives or repurchase 

agreement (repo) counterparty.  As the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banks 

with more material trading businesses in their U.S. operations are added to CCAR, we intend to 

revisit whether the global market shock and counterparty default component should be applied to 

firms beyond the U.S. GSIBs.  

Another argument offered against inclusion of the surcharge as an element of post-stress 

capital expectations is that the material distress or failure of a GSIB no longer poses a significant 



13 
 

threat to financial stability due to the regulations and supervisory programs that are designed to 

improve GSIB resolvability.  These measures include, among others, the proposed total loss 

absorbing capacity (TLAC) rule, the proposed qualifying financial contracts early termination 

rule and related International Swap and Derivatives Association (ISDA) protocols, and efforts to 

ensure firms engage in strong recovery and resolution planning.  

It is true that these efforts have improved GSIB resolvability in recent years.  But these 

efforts are ongoing, rather than complete.  More importantly, while there is certainly a 

relationship between the goals of strengthening the resiliency of the most systemically important 

firms and making them more readily resolvable should they nonetheless fail, those are still 

separate regulatory aims.  The demise of a very large financial institution would cause 

substantial damage to the economy and the financial system even if it was not so disorderly as to 

threaten the system entirely.  Note, in this regard, that the Dodd-Frank Act requires both more 

stringent prudential standards for systemically important firms and a process for promoting the 

orderly resolution of these same firms.  While the complementarity of these and other elements 

of a regulatory program always warrant consideration, and while adjustments in all aspects of the 

program should be made as conditions and practices evolve, current work on orderly resolution 

is surely no argument against the promotion of systemic stability and macroprudential aims by 

integrating the surcharge requirement with CCAR.   

Changes to the treatment of planned dividends and share repurchases  

The shift to a stress capital buffer approach would provide a mechanism for addressing 

two issues related to capital distribution limitations under CCAR.  The first is the arguable 

inconsistency between, on the one hand, the existing CCAR assumption that all planned 

dividends and share repurchases would proceed during the two-year planning horizon, regardless 



14 
 

of how much stress the bank was under and, on the other, the concept of a capital conservation 

buffer above minimum capital requirements as it has been added to the capital rules.  The second 

is a soft limitation on dividends put in place by the Board at the inception of CCAR.  Both of 

these features of CCAR reflected supervisory concerns with the fact that, even as the financial 

crisis was clearly unfolding, some of the largest banks continued to repurchase shares and pay 

dividends to shareholders and, thereby, depleted capital that proved to be needed later.12 

The SCB approach addresses the first of these issues by providing a continuous constraint 

on any planned distributions that would bring capital levels below the sum of the minimum 4.5 

percent of risk-weighted assets plus the firm-specific SCB, plus any applicable GSIB 

surcharge.13  However, because declines in observed and reported capital levels usually occur 

with a lag, and the historical evidence that dividends are less likely to be curtailed than share 

repurchases,14 we would assume a firm will maintain its dividends for one year while reducing 

its repurchases.  This would have the effect of requiring a firm to hold capital to meet its stress 

losses and fund its planned dividends over the next year. 

The switch to an SCB approach would also give us an opportunity to address a second 

issue, the soft limit on dividends in CCAR.  Since its inception, our policy statements on CCAR 

have indicated that a capital plan with a planned dividend payout ratio above 30 percent would 

be subjected to particularly close scrutiny.  When this policy was adopted in late 2010, we 

expected that it would be a useful guideline during a period when most of the CCAR banks 

                                                 
12 See Beverly Hirtle (2014), “Bank Holding Company Dividends and Repurchases during the Financial Crisis,” 
Staff Report No. 666 (New York: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, March). 
13 Were a countercyclical capital buffer to be imposed, it would be added to the buffers above the 4.5 percent 
minimum capital requirement. 
14 During the financial crisis, firms began to curtail share repurchases beginning in 2007 but generally did not cut 
dividends until late 2008. See Hirtle (2014). 



15 
 

would need to continue increasing capital levels for some time but also recognized that at some 

point we would need to revisit it.   

Since the new approach of adding one year’s planned dividends to a firm’s capital buffer 

should act as a disincentive for imprudent or unsustainable levels of dividends, the notion of 

extra scrutiny on planned dividends may no longer be useful.  And we would, in any case, be 

reluctant to substitute a higher payout ratio for the original 30 percent ratio because it may end 

up being an implicit target for banks to try to reach.  However, firms planning higher dividends 

should be aware that the operation of the SCB is such that, if a firm planned to pay out all of its 

earnings in the form of dividends and things did not go as well as expected for the firm, it could 

end up having to cut its dividend. 

Balance sheet and risk-weighted asset assumptions 

Beyond requiring that large banks have the resiliency to weather a period of serious 

financial stress, an important macroprudential aim of stress testing is to ensure that they can 

provide credit to households and businesses that remain creditworthy even in such a period.  If 

banks maintain their capital ratios under stress by reducing their balance sheets through asset 

sales, or reductions in new lending, this crucial intermediation function will be compromised 

across the economy.  The result could be a credit crunch, likely resulting in a more severe or 

longer-lasting recession.  In the first few years of CCAR, we used the banks’ own projections 

where many banks planned on balance sheet declines as part of their strategy for remaining 

sufficiently capitalized.15  In the 2014 CCAR cycle, we replaced banks’ projections with our own 

                                                 
15 The original stress test undertaken during the crisis did not allow this assumption, precisely because of our aim 
that the large banks as a group be well-positioned to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers at that time of great 
stress. 



16 
 

model, adding a requirement that banks would not restrict the supply of loans during the severely 

adverse scenario.   

To date, the model has actually operated to project an increase in the balance sheets of 

the CCAR banks during the severely adverse scenario, with varying impacts on different 

portfolios.  This assumption, and its somewhat complicated implementation, was designed to be 

fairly conservative, in a manner not dissimilar to the assumptions about capital distributions.  

Numerous banks have attempted to show why some of these portfolios or business lines would 

not be increasing under any reasonable assumptions, and thus that even macroprudential goals do 

not justify ignoring the likelihood that those portfolios would decline.  During our review of 

CCAR, some banks proposed ways to distinguish among business lines so as to relax what they 

argued to be an unrealistic assumption, even one with a macroprudential purpose.  

The complexities of trying to differentiate across idiosyncratic business lines seem to us 

considerable.  We are instead considering replacing this feature of our model with a simple 

assumption that balance sheets and risk-weighted assets remain constant over the severely 

adverse scenario horizon.  Given that some decline in demand by creditworthy borrowers for 

loans is inevitable in a serious recession, this simpler assumption would still achieve the 

macroprudential policy objective that any such decline in lending during a recession is 

attributable to the impact of the recession, rather than to capital constraints at the large banks. 

This change would also make the treatment of balance sheets and risk-weighted assets simpler 

and more transparent.  

Toward a more macroprudential stress testing regime 

 The second major objective in our stress testing review was to integrate more 

macroprudential elements into the program.  Of course, combining the GSIB surcharge with the 



17 
 

SCB approach promotes an important macroprudential aim, since the surcharges are calibrated to 

force large, interconnected banks to internalize the additional costs their distress would impose 

on the financial system.  The surcharges are thus at least a partial surrogate for inclusion of 

various macroprudential features in the stress test.  

We are also considering a couple of relatively modest revisions we are considering to the 

Board’s “Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing”16 that are 

motivated by the macroprudential consideration of reducing procyclicality.  The first would be to 

make the severity of the change in the unemployment rate less severe during downturns.  The 

second would be to replace the current judgmental approach to setting the hypothesized path of 

house prices by tying this variable to disposable personal income.  The result would be a more 

countercyclical path of house prices and increased transparency into how we determine the 

severity of this very important element of the scenario.  

 Beyond these steps, we heard many ideas during our review on how we might pursue our 

macroprudential objective by adding new features to the stress test, especially from official 

sector representatives and academics.  We also reviewed the growing academic literature on this 

topic.  We concluded that, to this point, even the most conceptually promising of the ideas are a 

good ways from being realized in specific and well-supported elements of our economic models.  

Many macroprudential risks involve the spread of stress from one firm or market to others.  As 

such, macroprudential elements of stress tests often must estimate not just first-round losses, but 

also the knock-on effects, which depend significantly on the vulnerabilities and responses of all 

other major actors in the financial system, including many that we do not regulate.  Modelling 

                                                 
16 See 12 CFR part 252, appendix A. 



18 
 

these effects requires information about the behavior of those actors that may not be observable 

either to a firm or to us.   

Notwithstanding these and other practical challenges, many of the suggestions we 

received have focused on important potential risks that bear further inquiry by regulators.  Hence 

we will be undertaking a research program to pursue these ideas in order to better understand the 

quantitative consequences of new risks and business activities, potential amplification channels 

such as fire sales by which stress could migrate from the large banks to the rest of the financial 

system, and important dynamics between capital and liquidity positions.  At a minimum, this 

research should inform scenario design and the overall regulatory and financial stability 

functions of the Board.  And at least some of the ideas might eventually be translated into 

features of the stress testing regime.  Over the medium term we view three related areas as the 

highest priorities: funding shocks, liquidity shocks, and spillovers from the default of common 

counterparties.   

Funding shocks 

Funding stresses are a natural starting point. As banks incur losses and their capital base 

erodes, some of their creditors will demand additional compensation and bank funding costs will 

increase.  This kind of “direct” funding shock is really microprudential because the resulting 

losses depend largely on the bank’s own decisions about its capital base, asset risk, and reliance 

on short-term wholesale funding.  As such, it should be more straightforward to integrate direct 

funding shocks into our main stress testing framework than to integrate systemwide effects, and 

we will consider whether, and how, to do so in the relatively near term. 

In a “systemic” funding shock, by contrast, each bank’s cost of funds depends on the 

capital position of the system as a whole.  By taking the overall solvency of the system into 



19 
 

account, this element captures a key amplification channel evident during the last financial crisis.  

As the banking system experienced capital losses, the cost of funding increased and some 

wholesale funding markets shut down even for relatively healthy banks.  The potential for this 

kind of funding shock means that the presence of a poorly capitalized bank might increase 

funding costs for all banks--a classic kind of macroprudential concern. 

Liquidity shocks and fire sale dynamics 

As we saw during the last financial crisis, repo and other funding markets can simply 

close to distressed institutions, which are then unable to access certain kinds of funds at any 

price.  Such a firm may then be forced to make up the funding shortfall by turning to market 

sources of liquidity by selling assets--both high-quality liquid assets like Treasury securities and 

less liquid assets.  During the financial crisis, distressed firms sold large amounts of securities as 

quickly as possible.  The fire sale price discounts required for such rapid execution in turn 

imposed mark-to-market losses on other firms with similar holdings.  To understand better this 

channel of financial contagion, we intend to continue our work on the ability of markets to 

handle large quantities of asset sales under stress, the capacity and willingness of firms to tap 

their buffers of high-quality assets, and the susceptibility of bank capital to mark-to-market 

losses from fire sales.  

Many commentators have drawn attention to these concerns, and some have advocated an 

integrated approach to capital and liquidity stress testing.  We may or may not be able to achieve 

this end point.  At a minimum, though, research in this area will allow us to move in this 

direction, perhaps by using the conclusions reached in the annual stress test as a starting point for 

our annual Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review (CLAR), or vice versa.  The results 

could also shed light on the current calibration of our liquidity rules.   



20 
 

Default of a common counterparty and the reaction of central counterparties 

Currently, the annual stress test incorporates a counterparty default scenario component 

for the eight G-SIBs that measures direct credit loss.  However, this component does not 

consider the potentially large second-round effects of the default of a major financial institution, 

including an increase in the probability of default of other counterparties as a result of the initial 

default and requirements for larger margins from derivatives counterparties.  Of particular 

interest is the role of central counterparties (CCPs) in alleviating or transmitting stress from the 

default of one of their members.  By regulatory design, CCPs have increased in prominence in 

the post-crisis environment because they can lead to greater efficiency and transparency in 

trading.  But this increased role makes it important to understand the impact they may have in 

stressed conditions.  For example, CCPs collect prefunded resources that can mitigate the impact 

of a default, but also can call on surviving clearing members for additional financial resources if 

those pre-funded resources are exhausted.  

Promoting transparency 

Transparency has played an important role in making stress testing such a key part of 

post-crisis prudential regulation.  Transparency of the scenarios and results gives investors and 

analysts valuable information about the condition of the tested banks, thereby contributing to 

market discipline.  It also allows the public to evaluate the job that the Federal Reserve is doing.  

For example, analysts can compare our loss estimates for specified portfolios under specified 

stress conditions with their own evaluations--an exercise that can inform both the analysts and 

us.   

There are three areas in which transparency considerations need to be applied.  First is the 

set of scenarios applied in the annual exercise.  We release essentially all details of the scenarios 



21 
 

and, further, have published a policy statement exploring the aims and factors relevant to 

development of the scenarios.17   

Second is the set of results of the DFAST and CCAR exercises themselves.  Right from 

the start--during the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) in 2009--we adopted what 

was then the controversial practice of publishing post-stress capital ratio results for each 

participating firm, along with a breakdown of the projected losses by loan type.  Since then, we 

have substantially increased the breadth of the disclosed results, including a summary of the 

reasons for any qualitative objection or conditional non-objection to firms’ capital plans.  During 

the course of our review, suggestions were made for more granular disclosures, such as 

providing more details on different components of projected net revenues.  We will make this 

change, and possibly a few others, over the course of the next cycle or two of stress testing.18 

The third area for transparency involves the supervisory models used in the stress tests.  

Banks involved in DFAST/CCAR have regularly requested more disclosures so that they can 

better understand the likely impact on their firms.  One argument has been that banks will have a 

difficult time in their capital planning if they cannot predict how loss functions and other model 

features will affect their stress losses.  In part to remove the possibility that a bank would receive 

a quantitative objection to its capital plan because of a large gap between their loss estimates and 

those produced by the supervisory model, a few years ago we began allowing banks to revise 

their capital distribution requests following receipt of their DFAST results.  Under the SCB 

                                                 
17 See 12 CFR 252, appendix A; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Policy Statement on 
the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing,” Final Rule; Policy Statement, November 29.   
18 Quite recently some banks have also suggested disclosing some version of the supervisory letters we send 
following the annual CCAR to each participating firm detailing our assessment of their capital planning processes.  
These banks believe that analysts and investors could benefit from knowing more detail on the concerns of the 
supervisors.  We had already been considering how to increase the information provided around qualitative 
objections or conditional non-objections and will factor these latest observations into this decision. 



22 
 

approach, a bank could also adjust its planned capital distributions after receiving the stress test 

results to avoid having its baseline capital distribution projections fall into the buffer. 

We have already taken a number of steps to respond to these requests.  We currently 

publish descriptions of all models used in the stress test, including the key risk drivers and 

scenario variables for each key modeling area.  We host an annual conference about modelling 

practices.  We disclose a description of the most material changes to stress test models before 

each stress test.  We are considering further steps, such as disclosing descriptions of changes 

well in advance of the stress test, and phasing in the most material model changes over two 

years, so as to smooth somewhat the effects of the changes on projected losses or revenues.  

Finally, and a bit more tentatively, we are assessing the feasibility of publishing data that 

represent typical bank portfolios of loans and securities with the losses we would project for 

those portfolios under various stress scenarios.  This kind of information could also help the 

public trace how changes in risk drivers alter loss projections. 

Having said all this, let me now say that we do not intend to publish the full computer 

code in the supervisory model that is used to project revenues and losses.  Full disclosure would 

permit firms to game the system--that is, to optimize portfolio characteristics based on the 

parameters of the model and take risks in areas not well-captured by the stress test just to 

minimize the estimated stress losses.  In part for this reason, full disclosure could promote a 

“model monoculture” in which both supervisors and firms use the same models to evaluate risks.  

A critical part of the DFAST/CCAR process is that firms use their own models to assess their 

risks.  We do not want them simply to copy the supervisory model and thereby increase the 

vulnerability of the financial system to the inevitable blind spots in even the best models. 



23 
 

In short, this is not like using a model to develop a regulation that, for example, limits 

emissions of polluting substances.  In such a case, adherence to the precise model output would 

itself achieve the regulatory purpose.  Here, by contrast, the very purpose of the regulatory 

regime would be undermined.  Remember, this is a stress test.  The shifts in activities of banks 

and in the economy create a dynamic set of risks.  Effective prudential regulation must be 

equally dynamic and should try to avoid pushing major financial firms toward measuring all of 

their risk positions in exactly the same way. 

 There is, however, one additional consideration.  Because the stress tests would be 

undermined by giving the models to the banks, there are of course limited opportunities for 

external parties to assess the models.  To promote the integrity of the models in these 

circumstances, we established a Model Validation Group, which is composed of modelling 

experts who are not involved in the design and application of the stress test models.  They make 

regular assessments and offer suggestions for improvement.  We expect to be providing the 

public greater information on our internal validation processes. 

Eliminating the qualitative CCAR exercise for smaller firms 

 As you can already tell, our responses to the need for better alignment of the stress test 

with our capital rules and to the desirability of more macroprudential emphasis each required a 

good bit of explanation.  In contrast, our response to the issue of the unnecessary burden on 

smaller, less complex CCAR firms is both simply stated and simply achieved. 

 In a notice of proposed rulemaking that the Board is releasing today we are proposing 

that banks with less than $250 billion in assets that do not have significant international or 

nonbank activity would no longer be included in the annual CCAR qualitative review.  As noted 

earlier, many of these firms have already met supervisory expectations.  We do not intend for 



24 
 

less complex firms to invest in stress testing capabilities on par with the most complex firms and, 

given their profile, we feel these firms can maintain the progress they have made through the 

normal supervisory process, supplemented with targeted horizontal reviews of discrete aspects of 

capital planning.   

This shift will reduce the intensity of supervision of their capital planning processes, 

remove any uncertainty as to supervisory expectations for their firms relative to the largest firms, 

and eliminate the possibility of a public objection to their capital plans on qualitative grounds.  

They would still be included in the quantitative side of the stress test and the proposed stress 

capital buffer.  But we are also proposing to reduce the amount of data these firms are required to 

submit for the purpose of running the stress test, on what we call the Y-14 regulatory reports.  

Unlike the other substantial changes we are contemplating to CCAR and our stress test, we are 

proposing that these changes would be effective next year, for CCAR 2017. 

 Conclusion 

This set of changes we are considering for our stress testing regime has been motivated 

by somewhat different considerations, against the backdrop of what we intend to remain a 

dynamic regulatory instrument whose procedures will be regularly refined and whose substance 

will be regularly adapted to changing economic conditions and industry practices.  Still, in 

pulling this package of modifications together, we have consciously shaped them in accordance 

with the principle that financial regulation should be progressively more stringent for firms of 

greater importance, and thus potential risk, to the financial system.  Two features of the package 

reflect this principle. 



25 
 

First, of course, is the elimination of the qualitative portion of CCAR for nearly all the 

firms with less than $250 billion in assets, along with some record keeping and reporting 

requirements.   

The second key feature is the differential impact the better alignment of CCAR with our 

capital regulations will have on the roughly 30 firms that are covered.  Let me note at the outset 

that the precise effects on the capital requirements of individual firms cannot be determined 

because of the very nature of the stress test regime.  The scenarios vary from year to year, and 

the resulting projected effects on losses and revenues may also vary materially depending on the 

composition of a firm’s balance sheet and activities.  However, to provide some idea of what the 

impact may be, we assessed how the various changes I have mentioned would have affected 

capital requirements in the two most recent CCAR cycles.  On average for the eight GSIBs, 

integration of the surcharge with the post-stress requirements would have been somewhat less 

than half offset by the simplifying changes in the prefunding of capital distributions and balance 

sheet assumptions.  The impact on capital requirements will likely be greater for firms with 

larger GSIB surcharges. 

For the other CCAR firms, for which there are no capital surcharges, these simplifying 

assumptions will result in some reduction of post-stress capital requirements.  We estimate that 

the aggregate impact of these changes for the CCAR firms as a whole should be a modest 

increase in the total amount of required capital.  But this increase will be totally due to the 

impact on the eight GSIB firms, whose increased capital requirements will more than offset the 

reductions for the other firms. 

 In short, the GSIBs will see their capital requirements rise.  All other CCAR firms will 

see some reduction in their capital requirements.  And firms that have less than $250 billion in 



26 
 

assets and do not have extensive international or nontraditional banking activities will also 

transition to a more tailored set of capital planning expectations outside the CCAR process.
