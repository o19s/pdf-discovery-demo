The Great Recession:  Moving Ahead 




Remarks by 


Stanley Fischer  


Vice Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at 


“The Great Recession--Moving Ahead”  


a Conference Sponsored by the Swedish Ministry of Finance 


Stockholm, Sweden 








August 11, 2014 





The recession that began in the United States in December 2007 ended in June 

2009.  But the Great Recession is a near-worldwide phenomenon, with the consequences 

of which many advanced economies--among them Sweden--continue to struggle.  Its 

depth and breadth appear to have changed the economic environment in many ways and 

to have left the road ahead unclear.   

Today I will discuss three key aspects of the challenges policymakers face as they 

seek to move ahead.  These are:  (1) The impact of the Great Recession and the 

associated Global Financial Crisis on the growth of output, both in the short term and 

over the longer term.  (2) The reform of the financial sector--in other words, how much 

progress have we made in creating a safer and more stable post-crisis financial 

environment?  (3) The impact of the crisis on the conduct of monetary policy--in 

particular, how to balance the goals of achieving stable inflation and full employment 

while also taking into account the need to maintain financial stability.  I will leave it to 

others to address the important challenges facing fiscal policymakers as they determine 

the appropriate roles and paths for fiscal policy at both the macro- and micro-levels.   

To keep the focus sharp, I will deal primarily with the economy of the United 

States.  But policymakers around the world confront related challenges and I will draw 

also on the post-crisis experiences of other economies.  And I should make it clear that 

my comments today are mine alone and do not necessarily represent the views of other 

members of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or the Federal Open 

Market Committee.1

Challenges Arising from the Growth Slowdown  

I begin by reviewing recent global economic developments and the questions they 

raise about where we are likely to go from here.  There has been a steady, if 

unspectacular, climb in global growth since the financial crisis.  For example, based on 

recent IMF data from the World Economic Outlook, which uses purchasing power parity 

weights, world growth averaged 3 percent during the first four years of the recovery and 

as of July was expected to be 3.4 percent this year.2  The IMF expects global growth to 

reach 4 percent next year--a rate about equal to its estimate for long-run growth.  This 

global average reflects a forecast of steady improvement in the performance of output in 

the advanced economies where growth averaged less than 1 percent during the initial 

phase of the recovery to an expected 2-1/2 percent by 2015.  In contrast, the recovery in 

the emerging market economies started strong but has since fallen off, in part, as fiscal 

policy stimulus has been pared back.  

But--and this is no small “but”--the global recovery has been disappointing.  With 

few exceptions, growth in the advanced economies has underperformed expectations of 

growth as economies exited from recession.  Year after year we have had to explain from 

mid-year on why the global growth rate has been lower than predicted as little as two 

quarters back.  Indeed, research done by my colleagues at the Federal Reserve comparing 

previous cases of severe recessions suggests that, even conditional on the depth and 

duration of the Great Recession and its association with a banking and financial crisis, the

recoveries in the advanced economies have been well below average.3  In the emerging 

market economies, the initial recovery was more in line with historical experience, but 

recently the pace of growth has been disappointing in those economies as well.  This 

slowing is broad based--with performance in Emerging Asia, importantly China, stepping 

down sharply from the post-crisis surge, to rates significantly below the average pace in 

the decade before the crisis.  A similar stepdown has been seen recently for other regions 

including Latin America.  

These disappointments in output performance have not only led to repeated 

downward revisions of forecasts for short-term growth, but also to a general reassessment 

of longer-run growth.  From the perspective of the FOMC, even in the heart of the crisis, 

in January 2009, the central tendency of the Committee members’ projections for longer-

run U.S. growth was between 2-1/2 and 3 percent.  At our June meeting this year, these 

projections had fallen to between roughly 2 and 2-1/4 percent.  This downward revision 

is not unique to our institution or to the United States.  Indeed, the IMF’s expectation for 

long-run global growth is now a full percentage point below what it was immediately 

before the Global Financial Crisis.4  This reconsideration reflects lower projected growth 

for both the advanced and the emerging market economies. 

This pattern of disappointment and downward revision sets up the first, and the 

basic, challenge on the list of issues policymakers face in moving ahead: restoring 

growth, if that is possible.  In some respects, we should not have been surprised at the

prolonged hit to output growth following the global financial crisis.  As Cerra and Saxena 

and Reinhart and Rogoff, among others, have documented, it takes a long time for output 

in the wake of banking and financial crises to return to pre-crisis levels.5  Possibly we are 

simply seeing a prolonged Reinhart-Rogoff cyclical episode, typical of the aftermath of 

deep financial crises, and compounded by other temporary headwinds.  But it is also 

possible that the underperformance reflects a more structural, longer-term, shift in the 

global economy, with less growth in underlying supply factors.   

Separating out the cyclical from the structural, the temporary from the permanent, 

impacts of the Great Recession and its aftermath on the macroeconomy is necessary to 

assessing and calibrating appropriate policies going forward.  The difficulty in 

disentangling demand and supply factors makes the job of the monetary policymaker 

especially hard since it complicates the assessment of the amount of slack, or 

underutilized productive capacity, in the economy.  Over the longer term it will be 

possible to disentangle the amount of slack on the basis of the behavior of prices and 

wages as the levels of resource utilization in economies rise, but it would be better to 

understand why growth has been so slow without experiencing either a runup in inflation 

or a descent into deflation.   

In the United States, three major aggregate demand headwinds appear to have 

kept a more vigorous recovery from taking hold.  The unusual weakness of the housing

sector during the recovery period, the significant drag--now waning--from fiscal policy, 

and the negative impact from the growth slowdown abroad--particularly in Europe--are 

all prominent factors that have constrained the pace of economic activity.    

The housing sector was at the epicenter of the U.S. financial crisis and recession 

and it continues to weigh on the recovery.  After previous recessions, vigorous rebounds 

in housing activity have typically helped spur recoveries. In this episode, however, 

residential construction was held back by a large inventory of foreclosed and distressed 

properties and by tight credit conditions for construction loans and mortgages.  Moreover, 

the wealth effect from the decline in housing prices, as well as the inability of many 

underwater households to take advantage of low interest rates to refinance their 

mortgages, may have reduced household demand for non-housing goods and services.    

Indeed, some researchers have argued that the failure to deal decisively with the housing 

problem seriously prolonged and deepened the crisis.6  Growth in other countries that 

experienced financial crises, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Spain, has been 

weighted down by struggling residential sectors.  More recently, many of these factors 

have abated in the United States and yet, after encouraging signs of improvement in 2012 

and in early 2013, over the past year the growth of residential construction has faltered 

and home sales have fallen off.  The sharp rise in mortgage interest rates in mid-2013 

likely contributed to this setback. 

The stance of U.S. fiscal policy in recent years constituted a significant drag on 

growth as the large budget deficit was reduced.  Historically, fiscal policy has been a 

support during both recessions and recoveries.  In part, this reflects the operation of

How We Can Prevent It from Happening Again (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).

automatic stabilizers, such as declines in tax revenues and increases in unemployment 

benefits, that tend to accompany a downturn in activity.  In addition, discretionary fiscal 

policy actions typically boost growth in the years just after a recession.  In the U.S., as 

well as in other countries--especially in Europe--fiscal policy was typically expansionary 

during the recent recession and early in the recovery, but discretionary fiscal policy 

shifted relatively fast from expansionary to contractionary as the recovery progressed.  In 

the United States, at the federal level, the end of the payroll tax cut, the sequestration, the 

squeeze on discretionary spending from budget caps, and the declines in defense 

spending have all curtailed economic growth.  Last year, for example, the Congressional 

Budget Office estimated that fiscal headwinds slowed the pace of real GDP growth in 

2013 by about 1-1/2 percentage points relative to what it would have been otherwise.  

Moreover, state and local governments, facing balanced budget requirements, have 

responded to the large and sustained decline in their revenues owing to the deep recession 

and slow recovery by reducing their purchases of real goods and services.  Job cuts at 

federal, state, and local governments have reduced payrolls by almost 3/4 of a million 

workers, resulting in a decline in total government civilian employment of 3-1/4 percent 

since its peak in early 2009.7  The fiscal adjustments of the last few years have reduced 

the federal government deficit to an expected level of 3 percent of GDP in 2014 and 

fiscal drag over the next few years is likely to be relatively low.  

A third headwind slowing the U.S. recovery has been unexpectedly slow global 

growth, which reduced export demand.  Over the past several years, a number of our key 

                                                 
7 None of this is to deny that it was necessary to reduce the large fiscal deficits in many countries that 

resulted from the combined effects of the recession and of expansionary fiscal policies at the early stages of 

the crisis; it simply reaffirms that the short-run impacts of contractionary fiscal policies are contractionary.

trading partners have suffered negative shocks.  Some have been relatively short lived, 

including the collapse in Japanese growth following the tragic earthquake in 2011.  

Others look to be more structural, such as the stepdown in Chinese growth compared to 

its double digit pre-crisis pace.  Most salient, not least for Sweden, has been the impact of 

the fiscal and financial situation in the euro area over the past few years.  Weaker 

economic conditions in Europe and other parts of the world have weighed on U.S. 

exports and corporate earnings; added to the risks that U.S. financial institutions, 

businesses, and households considered when making lending and investment decisions; 

and at times depressed U.S. equity prices.   

The housing market, fiscal consolidation, and unexpectedly anemic foreign 

demand all play a significant role in explaining the weakness of aggregate demand in the 

U.S. economy, weakness that could not have been accurately predicted based on past 

recession experiences or by the fact that this recession started with a massive financial 

crisis.  But, turning to the aggregate supply side, we are also seeing important signs of a 

slowdown of growth in the productive capacity of the economy--in the growth in labor 

supply, capital investment, and productivity.  This may well reflect factors related to or 

predating the recession that are also holding down growth.   

How much of this weakness on the supply side will turn out to be structural--

perhaps contributing to a secular slowdown--and how much is temporary but longer-than-

usual-lasting remains a crucial and open question.    

Looking at the aggregate production function, we begin with labor supply.  The 

considerable slowdown in the growth rate of labor supply observed over the past decade 

is a source of concern for the prospects of U.S. output growth.  There has been a steady 




- 8 - 

decrease in the labor force participation rate since 2000.  Although this reduction in labor 

supply largely reflects demographic factors--such as the aging of the population--

participation has fallen more than many observers expected and the interpretation of these 

movements remains subject to considerable uncertainty.  For instance, there are good 

reasons to believe that some of the surprising weakness in labor force participation 

reflects still poor cyclical conditions.  Many of those who dropped out of the labor force 

may be discouraged workers.  Further strengthening of the economy will likely pull some 

of these workers back into the labor market, although skills and networks may have 

depreciated some over the past years.  

Another factor that may be contributing to a slowdown in longer-run output 

growth is a decline in the rate of investment.  As is typical in a downturn, movements in 

investment were important to the cyclical swings in the economy during the Great 

Recession.  And, as would be expected given the depth of the downturn, investment 

declines were especially large in this episode.  However, in the United States, and in 

many other countries as well, the growth rate of the capital stock has yet to bounce back 

appreciably--despite historically low interest rates, access to borrowing for most firms, 

and ample profits and cash--causing concerns over the long-run prospects for the 

recovery of investment. 

Turning next to productivity growth, Solow’s famous result over fifty years ago 

was that over eighty percent of growth in output per hour in the period 1909-1949 came 

from technical change.8  Between 1964 and 2003 total factor productivity growth in the 

United States averaged around 1-1/2 percent, contributing to a 2 percent expansion per

year in U.S. GDP per capita.  At this rate, American standards of living would double 

every 35 years. 

However, productivity growth in recent years has been disappointing.  Over the 

past decade, U.S. total factor productivity growth declined to 1 percent, which some 

argue may represent the real norm for the U.S. economy.9  In this view, the long period of 

rapid productivity growth spurred by the technological innovations of the first and second 

Industrial Revolutions ended in the 1970s and the economy has continued at a lower 

productivity growth rate since then, except for a brief burst in the mid-1990s.  In 

particular, these authors argue that the information technology (IT) revolution of the past 

several decades--including the diffusion of computers, the development of the internet, 

and improvements in telecommunications—was an anomaly and is unlikely to generate 

the productivity gains prompted by earlier innovations such as electrification and mass 

production. 

Obviously, future productivity growth in the United States and in the world is yet 

to be determined.  Possibly we are moving into a period of slower productivity growth--

but I for one continue to be amazed at the potential for improving the quality of the lives 

of most people in the world that the IT explosion has already revealed.  Possibly,

productivity could continue to rise in line with its long-term historical average.10  After 

all, as the experience of the 1990s shows, productivity cycles are extremely difficult to 

predict and, even considering the slowdown of the past decade, U.S. total factor 

productivity growth fluctuated around 1-1/2 percent in the postwar period. In addition, 

the recent weakness could reflect Reinhart-Rogoff cyclical factors associated with the 

financial crisis, and pent up improvements could be revealed once confidence returns.11  

Finally, fears about the end of productivity gains are based on evidence from the United 

States and other advanced economies.  Globally, however, there is tremendous scope for 

productivity gains reflecting technological catch up, infrastructure investment, and the 

potential for human capital increases due to improvements in education and nutrition, and 

the incorporation and inclusion of women into the labor force.  These gains should 

benefit not just the emerging market economies but also the rest of world more generally, 

including the United States.   

At the end of the day, it remains difficult to disentangle the cyclical from the 

structural slowdowns in labor force, investment, and productivity.  Adding to this

uncertainty, as research done at the Fed and elsewhere highlights, the distinction between 

cyclical and structural is not always clear cut and there are real risks that cyclical slumps 

can become structural;  it may also be possible to reverse or prevent declines from 

becoming permanent through expansive macroeconomic policies.12  But three things are 

for sure: first, the rate of growth of productivity is critical to the growth of output per 

capita; second, the rate of growth of productivity at the frontiers of knowledge is 

especially difficult to predict; and third, it is unwise to underestimate human ingenuity.   

The Post-Crisis Regulatory and Supervisory Environment 

The severity of the Great Recession and its ongoing fallout, importantly including 

its influence on public opinion, has heightened the focus on the challenge of avoiding 

another such crisis.  Indeed, financial sector reform proposals by groups such as the Basel 

Committee on Banking Supervision, the Financial Stability Board, and the Group of 

Thirty were circulating within a few months of the Lehman Brothers’ failure.  Since then, 

policymakers, acting in their own countries and in coordination with others, have enacted 

financial sector regulatory reforms on a scale and scope not seen since the Great 

Depression.   

 Designing, implementing, and understanding the consequences of these 

important reforms are major challenges for policymakers in a post-Global Financial 

Crisis world. Most of the initial proposals incorporated some or most of the following 

goals:

1. To strengthen the stability and robustness of financial firms, “with particular 

emphasis on standards for governance, risk management, capital and liquidity”;13   

2. To strengthen the quality and effectiveness of prudential regulation and supervision, 

with higher standards for systemically important firms;  

3. To build the capacity for undertaking effective macroprudential regulation and 

supervision;  

4. To develop suitable resolution regimes for financial institutions;  

5. To strengthen the infrastructure of financial markets, including markets for derivative 

transactions;  

6. To improve compensation practices in financial institutions;  

7. To strengthen international coordination of regulation and supervision, particularly 

with regard to the regulation and resolution of global systemically important financial 

institutions, later known as G-SIFIs;  

8. To better monitor risks within the shadow banking system, and find ways of dealing 

with them; and  

9. To improve the performance of credit rating agencies, which were deeply involved in 

the collapse of markets for collateralized and securitized lending instruments, 

especially those based on mortgage finance. 


More than six years later, policymakers around the globe have made substantial 

progress in strengthening the financial system and reducing the probability of future 

financial crises.  Globally, the minimum tier 1 capital ratio has been increased, and a 

capital conservation buffer has been put in place.  In addition, a countercyclical capital 

buffer has been created that enables regulators to raise risk-based capital requirements 

when necessary, and a minimum international leverage ratio has been set.  Finally, global 

systemically important banks will face a risk-based capital surcharge based on their

systemic risk.  Global bank regulators have also developed, for the first time, liquidity 

regulations designed to improve the funding durability and overall liquidity resiliency of 

internationally active banks. 

Additional steps have been taken in some countries.  For example, in the United 

States, capital ratios and liquidity buffers at the largest banks are up considerably, and 

their reliance on short-term wholesale funding has declined considerably.  Work on the 

use of the resolution mechanisms set out in the Dodd-Frank Act, based on the principle of 

a single point of entry--though less advanced than the work on capital and liquidity 

ratios--holds the promise of making it possible to resolve banks in difficulty at no direct 

cost to the taxpayer.  As part of this approach, the United States is preparing a proposal to 

require systemically important banks to issue bail-inable long-term debt that will enable 

insolvent banks to recapitalize themselves in resolution without calling on government 

funding--this cushion is known as a “gone concern” buffer. 

At the same time, the introduction of macroeconomic supervisory stress tests in 

the United States has added a forward-looking approach to assessing capital adequacy, as 

firms are required to hold a capital buffer sufficient to withstand a several-year period of 

severe economic and financial stress. The stress tests are a very important addition to the 

toolkit of supervisors, one that is likely to add significantly to the quality and 

effectiveness of financial sector supervision, and one that should spread internationally as 

a best practice.    

Still, more remains to be done.  Although the Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision and the FSB reached impressively rapid agreement on needed changes in 

regulation and supervision, progress in agreeing on the resolution of G-SIFIs and some 




- 14 - 

other aspects of international coordination has been slow. It will also be important to 

ensure that coordination among different regulators of the financial system is effective 

and, in particular, will be effective in the event of a crisis.    

In addition, policymakers still have a good deal to learn about how these various 

reforms will change financial market structure and functioning, how effective they will 

be in enhancing stability, and whether there will be unintended consequences.  Among 

the most important of the possible unintended consequences is that toughened regulation 

of banks will move some financial activity out of the banking system and into the shadow 

banking system.  

In summary, considerable progress has been made in strengthening bank capital 

and liquidity; in improving the quality and effectiveness of prudential regulation and 

supervision; in developing suitable resolution regimes for financial institutions; and in 

strengthening the infrastructure for the clearing and trading of derivative contracts.  It is 

clear that further progress is needed with respect to goals 6-9, relating respectively to: 

improving compensation practices; strengthening international coordination, especially 

with regard to the resolution and regulation of G-SIFIs; finding ways of dealing with the 

shadow banking system; and improving the quality of credit rating agencies.   

That leaves aside the question of the capacity for effective macroprudential 

supervision, an issue we will take up as we begin to discuss the optimal conduct of 

monetary policy in the wake of the crisis, given the heightened attention of monetary 

policymakers to the importance of maintaining financial stability.

Issues Facing Monetary Policymakers in the Wake of the Crisis and Recession 

Prior to the global financial crisis, a rough consensus had emerged among 

academics and monetary policymakers that best-practice for monetary policy was flexible 

inflation targeting.  In the U.S., flexible inflation targeting is implied by the dual mandate 

given to the Fed, under which monetary policy is required to take into account deviations 

of both output and inflation from their target levels.  But even in countries where the 

central bank officially targets only inflation, monetary policymakers in practice also aim 

to stabilize the real economy around some normal level or path.    

Much has changed in the world of central banking since the onset of the Great 

Recession.  With short-term interest rates near zero, many central banks considerably 

expanded their balance sheets, for instance through large-scale purchases of assets or 

significant liquidity injections.  They also engaged in forward guidance to put downward 

pressure on interest rates and support aggregate demand.   

I consider quantitative easing to have been largely successful, and that data 

dependent forward guidance consistent with the central bank’s expectations of its future 

intentions can also be successful.  But the use of these tools--particularly as reflected in 

the size of central bank balance sheets--will make the conduct of monetary policy more 

complicated during the recovery.  In the United States, we have a number of tools to 

control short-term rates, despite the large level of reserves in the system.  Raising the rate 

of interest paid on excess reserves should play a central role in the eventual normalization 

of short-term interest rates.  An overnight reverse repo facility could also play a useful 

part in setting a floor under money market rates.  With these and other possible tools, we

will be able to raise rates and maintain them near their targeted level at the appropriate 

time.   

Another important question is whether monetary policymakers should alter their 

basic framework of flexible inflation targeting to take financial stability into account.  My 

answer to that question is that the “flexible” part of flexible inflation targeting should 

include contributing to financial stability, provided that it aids in the attainment of the 

main goals of monetary policy.  The main goals in the United States are those of the dual 

mandate, maximum employment and stable prices; in other countries the main goal is 

stable prices or low inflation.  

What can the central bank do when financial stability is threatened?  If it has 

effective macroprudential tools at its disposal, it can deploy those.  If it does not itself 

have the authority to use such tools, it can try to persuade those who do have the tools to 

use them.  If no such tools are available in the economy, the central bank may have to 

consider whether to use monetary policy--that is, the interest rate--to deal with the threat 

of financial instability.  At the moment in the U.S., though there may be some areas of 

concern, I do not think that financial stability concerns warrant deviating from our 

traditional focus on inflation and employment.   

A decision on whether to use the interest rate to deal with the threat of financial 

instability is always likely to be difficult--particularly in a small open economy, where 

raising the interest rate is likely to produce an unwanted exchange rate appreciation.  So a 

critical question must be whether effective macroprudential policies are to be found in the 

country in question.

I had some experience with these issues while at the Bank of Israel.  In Israel, 

three separate regulators deal with different aspects of macroprudential policy, but there 

is no formal financial stability committee.  The Bank of Israel is also the supervisor of 

banks, so has considerable power over housing finance, which essentially is available 

only from the banks.  Starting in 2010, the Bank of Israel adopted several 

macroprudential measures to address rapidly rising house prices, including higher capital 

requirements and provisioning against mortgages; limits to the share of any housing 

financing package indexed to the short-term (central bank) interest rate to one-third of the 

total loan, with the remainder of the package having to be linked to either the five-year 

real or five-year nominal interest rate; and, on different occasions, limits to the loan-to-

value (LTV) and payment-to-income (PTI) ratios.  Additional precautionary measures 

were also implemented in the supervision of banks.   

The success of these policies was mixed. The limit of one-third on the share of 

any housing loan indexed to the short rate substantially raised the cost of housing finance 

and was the most successful of the measures.  Increases in both the LTV and PTI ratios 

were moderately successful.  Increasing capital charges and risk weights appeared to 

have little impact in practice.   

This experience led me to three conclusions on the effectiveness of 

macroprudential policies.  First, we were very cautious in using these new tools because 

we did not have good estimates of their strength and effectiveness.  Quite possibly, we 

should have acted more boldly on several occasions.  Second, use of these tools is likely 

to be unpopular, for housing is a sensitive topic in almost every country.  And third, 

coordination among different regulators and authorities can be complicated.

The difficulty of coordinating among different independent regulators makes it 

likely that the degree to which macroprudential policies can be successful depends 

critically on the institutional setup of financial supervision in each country.  Different 

countries have structured their macroprudential policymaking institutions in different 

ways.  In the U.K., the Financial Policy Committee has been set up within the Bank of 

England, with the power to make financial policy--including macroprudential policy--

decisions.  In the U.S., the Financial Stability Oversight Council is a coordinating 

committee of the major regulators.  And in Sweden, responsibility for macroprudential 

oversight and financial stability lies with the Financial Supervisory Authority, which is 

separate from the Riksbank.   

Overall, it is clear that we have much to learn about both the effectiveness of 

different macroprudential measures, and about the best structure of the regulatory system 

from the viewpoint of implementing strong and effective macroprudential supervision 

and regulation.  And, while there may arise situations where monetary policy needs to be 

used to deal with potential financial instability, I believe that macroprudential policies 

will become an important complement to our traditional tools.  Learning how best to 

employ all of our potential policy tools, and arrive at a new set of best practices for 

monetary policy, is one of the key challenges facing economic policymakers.   

Concluding Remarks 

As we continue to move forward in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and 

the Great Recession, policymakers around the world are dealing with new challenges that 

these historically important events have raised.  In addition to the difficulties of assessing 

the relative importance of cyclical (short-term) versus structural (long-term) factors

affecting the global economy, and in thinking about how to return to higher output and 

productivity growth, policymakers are focusing on the uses of monetary policy in 

attaining the dual goals of maximum employment and stable prices and in maintaining 

financial stability.  They need also to strengthen financial sector regulation and 

supervision to reduce the probability of another crisis.   

At the same time, and although I earlier foreswore discussion of fiscal policy, it is 

clear that fiscal policies can be used both to increase growth and to deal with potential 

problems of financial stability. 

I look forward to hearing your views on the best way to move ahead on these and 

the other important issues we have gathered to discuss.   

Thank you.
