March 27, 2012 





I am pleased to participate in the ninth biennial National Interagency Community 

Reinvestment Conference.  Since its inception in 1996, this conference has fulfilled its 

mission to train bankers and community development professionals on the requirements 

of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) by providing cutting-edge information about 

regulations, policies, and best practices in community development.  In addition, it has 

become a source of inspiration for CRA-related community development activities.  As 

this year’s agenda demonstrates, this interagency conference has grown to encompass all 

aspects of community development, including discussions of community amenities that 

provide both quality of life and economic resilience for low- and moderate-income 

residents.   

Before I begin, I would like to thank the thousands of community development 

professionals I have met in the course of my work with the Federal Reserve for helping 

me to understand the breadth of the work that they do.  In fact, many of you are here 

today.  You have shown me your projects, shared your triumphs and frustrations, testified 

at hearings on the future of CRA, served on our Consumer Advisory Council, and 

actively participated in Federal Reserve conferences. Your counsel has given me a deeper 

appreciation of the complexities involved in creating and maintaining strong 

communities, particularly in times of economic stress.  In my remarks today, I would like 

to share some of these insights.    

Background 

With the enactment of CRA in 1977, Congress directed financial regulators to 

assess each depository institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its entire 

community, including its community’s low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  In the 


 - 2 -

early years, even though CRA evaluations considered an institution’s provision of all 

types of credit in lower-income communities, most were primarily focused on mortgage 

credit.  This was in part due to the availability of Home Mortgage Disclosure Act 

(HMDA) data which made robust analysis of mortgage lending possible.  In addition, the 

focus of community development advocates on housing issues, including the redlining 

practices that prompted CRA’s passage, eclipsed the law’s broad scope in public 

perception.  Only over time have community stakeholders come to appreciate the broader 

context of CRA.   

Today, financial institutions have become partners in community development, 

bringing with them an important source of capital and financial expertise.  By working 

together, bankers, community development practitioners, state and local governments, 

and other community stakeholders have learned a great deal, and the community 

development field has matured significantly.   

Places and People 
 

At one time, policy discussions revolved around whether community development 

was about people or places.  I would argue that the debate is over and both sides won.  

Successful community development is based on attention to both the physical 

infrastructure, whether housing or commercial spaces, and the health and welfare of the 

residents therein.  CRA supports community development by requiring financial 

institutions to identify and address the financial needs of the communities they serve.   

Safe and affordable housing will always be an important concern for lower-

income Americans, but the recent recession and resulting damage to communities across 

the country make it clear that communities are more than physical structures.  Sustainable

communities--those that can weather economic downturns--not only provide decent 

housing, but also have the resources to support individuals and families and to create a 

dynamic business environment.  For this reason, community development today is a 

multidisciplinary exercise that challenges us to think holistically about how housing 

relates to jobs, educational opportunities, transportation, healthcare, and other services 

and amenities. 

Neighborhood Stabilization 

Taking a well-rounded approach is essential now, as weak national economic 

conditions have caused particular hardships in lower-income communities, and have 

stretched the federal, state, and local resources available to address neighborhood 

stabilization and revitalization.  In some areas, high rates of vacant and abandoned 

properties resulting from foreclosures have depressed housing values, drained the coffers 

of local governments, and created breeding grounds for crime and other social ills in what 

were otherwise stable, albeit low-income, communities.  The result has been a shift in 

focus in community development, from building new housing to preserving or disposing 

of existing housing. 

In recent years, local governments and community-based organizations have 

struggled to counter the effects of foreclosures on neighborhoods.  Some communities 

have found success by establishing land banks to manage low-value properties that might 

otherwise sit vacant if left to the private market. 1  Land banks are typically public or

Acquisition Problems,” in REO and Vacant Properties: Strategies for Neighborhood Stabilization,

nonprofit entities, often with a limited lifespan and sunset provisions.  The notion of a 

land bank, as opposed to a land trust, is that properties are brought in and moved out of a 

land bank’s portfolio rather than permanently preserved.  While part of the land bank’s 

portfolio, foreclosed properties can be physically rehabilitated, rented, sold to new 

owner-occupants or responsible investors, or, in some cases, demolished.  Using this kind 

of mechanism, a community can gain control of vacant properties and keep them from 

causing problems for the surrounding neighborhood until market conditions are more 

conducive to redevelopment or sale.   

Land banks are just one example of the new approaches to housing issues that are 

being pursued across the country, many with the assistance of the Neighborhood 

Stabilization Program (NSP) administered by the Department of Housing and Urban 

Development.  The NSP program offers some funding to tackle these issues, but it also 

provides a structure to bring community stakeholders together to identify the best 

strategies for addressing foreclosures given the particular circumstances of each 

community.  Whether a community decides to purchase and rehabilitate homes for resale, 

demolish vacant homes, or create land banks to help control the destiny of these 

properties, the collaborative problem-solving approach used by NSP is one that can make 

the most of limited resources.   

Neighborhood stabilization is doubtless the precursor to community development 

in some communities and, in recognition of this, the federal banking agencies amended 

CRA regulations to specifically recognize neighborhood stabilization activities in 

designated NSP areas as appropriate for CRA consideration.2  In addition, the Federal

Reserve has identified and shared a number of promising practices for dealing with 

foreclosed and vacant homes.3  While some cities are pioneering with land banks, others, 

such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Baltimore, are using data to plan for the future in ways 

that city governments wouldn’t have imagined just a few years ago.  Partnering with local 

foundations, universities, and community organizations, these cities are collecting 

extensive property data to identify neighborhood assets and build on those strengths.4  In 

Phoenix, local officials and non-profits are partnering with local realtors to match 

families with affordable homes for sale. 

Unemployment 

The foreclosure crisis that resulted from unsustainable subprime lending has 

persisted largely because of high unemployment rates.  Thus, in order to be successful, 

any effort to stabilize and revitalize lower-income neighborhoods will need to consider 

housing through the lens of access to jobs and educational opportunities.  The Federal 

Reserve System currently has an initiative underway to better understand the relationship 

between community development activities and successful workforce development 

strategies.  We anticipate that this research will provide valuable information for bankers 

and their community partners as they address the needs of their communities. 

                                                                                                                                                 
activities that meet the “eligible uses” criteria in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 and are 
conducted in designated target areas identified in NSP plans approved by the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development.

Of course, having a job is one thing.  Getting to it is another.  With good reason, 

transportation considerations have become more common in community development 

plans in recent years.   More communities are taking public transportation into account 

when planning residential projects.  Given the high cost of owning and operating a car, 

transportation options are a significant factor in a neighborhood’s overall affordability.  

Demographic shifts over the last decade have resulted in the suburbanization of poverty, 

and now dictate that communities work together to create transportation options, 

including buses, light rail, and even car-sharing arrangements.   

Even so, as the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond has discovered in its work on 

car ownership for low-income workers, public transportation is not always sufficient to 

solve the transportation problems of the poor.  Some jobs, such as construction work, 

require that workers report to different locations.  Shift workers, whether security guards, 

airport baggage handlers, or hospital workers, may not have easy access to public 

transportation at night.  Supporting nonprofit organizations, such as Vehicles for Change, 

which takes donated cars and refurbishes them for sale to low-income workers for a very 

small fee, may be the most effective means for some communities to overcome the 

barriers to car ownership.5   

One of the more innovative solutions to this issue that I have seen was developed 

by an organization in Dallas that aims to move the jobs to the workers, rather than vice 

versa.  Lone Star Investment Advisors LLC is a private equity fund that invests in Texas 

companies located in, or willing to move to, low-income census tracts.  The fund's 

managers have focused on manufacturing and distribution companies that can create jobs

in the state's lower-income communities.  One of the businesses in the fund’s portfolio, 

PrimeSource Food Service Equipment, moved from an affluent northern Dallas suburb to 

South Dallas, where the poverty rate was higher than 40 percent, relocating more than 

100 employees and hiring new employees from South Dallas.  I raise this example 

because it demonstrates what a little imagination can do to solve the problem of 

connecting people with jobs.  Moreover, this double bottom-line approach to 

investments--making a profit while benefitting the community--makes this kind of 

activity attractive to bankers with CRA obligations and other socially-minded investors. 

Community Development:  An Entrepreneurial Enterprise  

This innovative example serves as a reminder that successful community 

development is an entrepreneurial enterprise.  Thinking about community development 

this way reminds me of a presentation made at a recent Federal Reserve research 

conference on small business and entrepreneurship.6  Amy Wilkinson, Senior Fellow at 

Harvard’s Kennedy School Center for Business and Government, has conducted research 

to identify the skill sets of high-impact entrepreneurs and small business leaders.  The 

skills she identified are, not surprisingly, applicable to community development.  They 

include being able to spot opportunities that others don’t see, managing complexity, 

reiterating ideas and revamping plans repeatedly, experimenting and failing wisely, 

networking to create solutions, and, as Amy put it, “unleashing generosity” in ways that 

create reciprocity within the network.

No doubt these sound familiar.  Community development is an ongoing process 

of identifying and understanding the complicated interaction of people and places.  

Solutions are found through the cycle of experimentation and adjustment.  Successes look 

easy but they mask hard work and, often, failed attempts.  Transformational changes in 

communities rarely happen without the involvement and support of a network that 

includes residents, business owners, community organizations, financial institutions, and 

local government.   Sustained interaction among these stakeholders is what makes the 

opportunity known and the solution successful.   

The city of Rochester, New York, put these principles to work and managed to 

weather the bankruptcy of the city’s largest employer.  Eastman Kodak once employed 

some 61,000 Rochester residents and invested significantly in the city’s educational and 

cultural institutions; three decades later, it employs fewer than 7,000 people and recently 

filed for bankruptcy protection.7 This is not an uncommon story, except for the fact that 

Rochester managed to gain a net of 90,000 jobs during the three decades of employment 

decline at Kodak.   

How did Rochester manage this transition so successfully?  The city recognized 

early on the need to diversify its economic base and, some 20 years ago, created a 

network of private and nonprofit partnerships to leverage the city’s assets, the same 

universities and cultural institutions Kodak had supported.  Together with local 

government, this network trained entrepreneurs and supported new business ventures, 

many of which are in optics and photonics.  Through foresight and the collaboration of 

government, private and nonprofit partners, and committed citizens, Rochester was able

to build on the Kodak legacy, effectively turning lost jobs at Kodak into new local 

opportunities.  

Healthy Communities 

In addition to housing and employment, residents need communities that support 

their health and well-being in a variety of ways.  Community developers play a critical 

role in supporting healthy lifestyles by planning for sidewalks, parks, and other open 

spaces connecting housing and commercial areas in ways that also provide places for 

people to meet and children to play.  Renovation and new construction plans increasingly 

adhere to standards that incorporate “green” materials and technologies not only because 

they lower utility costs, which is important, but also because they improve health results, 

such as asthma rates, among residents.   

One of the most obvious ways to support healthy lifestyles in lower-income 

neighborhoods is by making healthy food accessible.  In the face of increasing rates of 

obesity, low-income neighborhoods are notably underserved by grocery stores.  This is 

beginning to change because of programs like The Pennsylvania Fresh Food Financing 

Initiative, which is supported by a partnership between The Reinvestment Fund, a 

nonprofit developer, and two community organizations, The Food Trust and the Greater 

Philadelphia Urban Affairs Coalition.  This partnership stepped in to fill a financing need 

where infrastructure costs were not met by conventional financial institutions.  Their 

original objective was to make fresh food available in low-income neighborhoods.  But 

they have achieved much more.  The grocery stores the partnership helped to establish 

create an anchor for other retail needs in the area.  Moreover, the stores hire local workers 

and train them in both the required job skills and in the workplace etiquette necessary to 


 - 10 -

succeed in any job.  One of the original groceries financed under the program has also 

added in-store financial services and a health clinic.  As this grocery operator discovered, 

access to healthcare is another critical need in many low-income communities.   

In Chicago, residents have taken it upon themselves to fill the need for primary 

and specialty healthcare by establishing the Lawndale Christian Health Center.  

Ownership in the Center is retained by residents to ensure that it continues to meet the 

needs of its neighborhood.  In another example of a community facility meeting more 

than one need, the Center has expanded over time to provide leadership development and 

organizational capacity building services to its members in addition to health services. 

Conclusion  

I could go on to recite more examples of programs that respond to community 

needs, but I think you get my point:  Taking an entrepreneurial approach to community 

development results in innovative and effective programs, making communities more 

desirable places to live and more resilient in hard times.  The CRA regulations encourage 

banks and thrifts to invest in activities that provide affordable housing or financial 

services for individuals, promote economic development, or revitalize or stabilize low- or 

moderate-income areas.   

At a time when the needs of these communities are so great and the resources 

available to meet those needs are so scarce, it behooves financial institutions to think 

broadly about their CRA obligations.  By partnering with other community stakeholders, 

these institutions can help address existing community needs and lay the groundwork for 

stronger credit demand in the future.   


 - 11 -

 I don’t want to underestimate the difficulty of the task.  The recession damaged 

communities of all types, but particularly lower-income neighborhoods, and economic 

recovery has been stubbornly slow.  Nonetheless, the commitment and innovation 

demonstrated in communities all across the country is encouraging.  Taking an 

entrepreneurial approach to community development and thinking about the needs of 

both people and places will, I believe, make for stronger, more resilient communities in 

the future.
