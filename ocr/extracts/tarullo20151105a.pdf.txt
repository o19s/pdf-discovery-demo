The regulation of financial institutions is necessarily a dynamic exercise.  Growth or 

innovations in banking may create new risks that prompt regulatory change.  The new 

requirements, in turn, incentivize or disincentivize certain actions by financial institutions, 

including shifts in activity that may start anew the process of regulatory response.  The 

regulation of international banking reflects this general pattern, but because internationally active 

banks can quickly transmit financial problems across national boundaries, it also features the 

question of who should be doing the regulating in a dynamic financial environment.   

Following the financial crisis, during which some internationally active banks posed 

special problems for both home and host countries, this issue has commanded attention 

reminiscent of the aftermaths of the Herstatt failure of the 1970s and the Bank of Commerce and 

Credit International (BCCI) failure of the early 1990s.  Unlike those earlier instances, though, 

this renewed prominence of the “who does the regulating” question has accompanied a major 

reconsideration of what regulation is appropriate.  Today I would like to address both the “who” 

and the “what” issues in the regulation of international banking.  My theme is hardly an original 

one--namely, that in the absence of either a global regulator or completely insular national 

banking systems, we must continue to work toward a system of shared responsibilities to assure 

both home and host regulators that internationally active banks are subject to adequate oversight 

and controls. 

I will begin by reviewing briefly the benefits and risks associated with international 

banking and then identifying the different models for allocating responsibility for the oversight 

of international banks.  After noting the shortcomings of the system for regulating internationally 

active banks that prevailed before the financial crisis and developments in the intervening years, 


 2  
 

I will turn to a consideration of the challenges that remain, with a few suggestions on how we 

might make more progress.   

Benefits and Risks of International Banking  

It is worth at least briefly reminding ourselves of some of the more salient advantages 

and risks associated with cross-border banking as they help inform development of regulatory 

options.1   

 Among the potential advantages are facilitating productive capital flows, diversifying 

risks associated with growth in host countries, diversifying the earnings and thus the stability of 

the global bank, offering counter-cyclical lending through support from the parent when host 

country economic conditions constrain domestic banking operations, enhancing efficiency in 

financial intermediation in host countries, providing specialized financial services,2 and 

providing price or product competition for banking services in host countries.  The magnitude of 

these benefits obviously differs from country to country, depending on a variety of factors.  

Some of these benefits can be greater if foreign banks have the freedom to deploy capital and 

liquidity to whatever markets offer the most attractive opportunities, whereas others are 

achievable simply through the bank’s expertise, existing business relationships, and range of 

services.   

                                                 
1 By “cross-border banking,” I mean to refer broadly to activities carried on outside of a bank’s home country 
through subsidiaries and branches.  I do not include direct lending or other financial transactions across national 
borders, whether or not facilitated by an agency in the country of the bank’s customer or counterparty.  While such 
activities can raise concerns pertaining to investor protection, the volatility of financial flows, or foreign exchange 
policies, relevant prudential considerations will generally be limited to the country(ies) from which the bank is 
initiating the transaction and raising any funds needed to fund it.  

For references to many individual studies examining one or more the advantages or risks, see Stijn Claessens and 
Neeltje van Horen (2014), “The Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Banking Globalization,” IMF Working 
Papers 14/197 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, October). 
2 For an example, see Stijn Claessens, Omar Hassib, and Neeltje van Horen (2015), “The Role of Foreign Banks in 
Trade,” mimeo, (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and De Nederlandsche Bank, 
March).

 On the other side of the ledger are the risks associated with foreign banking that are 

distinct from risks associated with banking more generally.  These risks tend to be related to the 

parent bank’s capacity to support the larger organization.  Reversals in the home market or other 

significant foreign operations may reduce the ability of the parent to support its foreign affiliates 

with needed capital and liquidity.  Even if the foreign affiliate is not itself under great stress, the 

weakened overall condition of the parent because of problems in other parts of the world may 

prompt it to retrench--often rather abruptly--by reducing activity in foreign markets in which it is 

active.  This response may be driven either by bank management itself or at the instance of home 

country officials who want the bank to continue to lend in its home market.  Especially in 

countries where foreign banks account for a significant part of financial intermediation and 

where the underlying problems are not idiosyncratic to a specific bank, the result may be a 

significant diminution in intermediation beyond what would have taken place because of 

macroeconomic developments. 

 Even more serious is the risk that the foreign bank will fail, and that the home country 

will lack the resources or the will to ensure either that it is recapitalized and continues to function 

or that it fails in an orderly fashion.  If the foreign operation has been thinly capitalized and is 

lacking in liquidity, host country officials may face an unpleasant choice between supporting a 

foreign bank (including operations for which they have not had consolidated supervisory 

responsibility) or allowing it to fail in a disorderly fashion, with potentially serious knock-on 

effects in the host country’s financial system.   

 Thus, what might have been economic advantages for host countries from foreign banks 

in reasonably good times can turn into substantial disadvantages in periods of idiosyncratic or 

generalized stress.  As with the benefits of foreign banking, the risks vary considerably among 


 4  
 

host countries.  Obviously, countries without well-developed domestic banking systems will both 

benefit more and be at greater risk.  Yet even the most sophisticated domestic financial systems 

can be affected significantly.  For example, the risks can be exacerbated by funding patterns and 

currency mismatches, as happened in the United States during the financial crisis.  Foreign banks 

that had been using their U.S. branches to raise dollars in short-term markets for lending around 

the world were suddenly left without access to this funding and, as a result, made substantial 

and--relative to their assets--disproportionate use of the Federal Reserve’s discount window. 

Approaches to the Regulation of Internationally Active Banks 

 As I mentioned at the outset, international banking raises the question of who should do 

the regulating, as well as the question of what regulation is appropriate.  The two questions are 

related, of course.  As I will explain shortly, the nature of regulations in part depends upon the 

perspective and aims of the regulator.  There are essentially four models, each of which has 

benefits and shortcomings. 

 First, the home jurisdiction can have dominant or exclusive regulatory responsibility for 

all of its banks’ global operations through application of consolidated regulation and supervision.  

Second, host jurisdictions can have dominant regulatory responsibility for all foreign banking 

operations within their borders.  This approach requires foreign banks to charter locally and to 

meet the same regulatory and supervisory standards applicable to domestic banks.  Third, there 

can be shared authority between home and host jurisdictions, whereby host countries do some 

regulating and supervising of foreign banks within their borders but do not require all foreign 

banking activities to be locally chartered and subject to regulation identical to that of home 

banks.  Finally, there could be one global regulator to oversee all the operations of 

internationally active banks around the world. 


 5  
 

 There is an almost unlimited number of variations on the shared approach and, in fact, 

one or another variants on that approach have been adopted by most jurisdictions during the 

modern banking era (though there have been instances of countries severely limiting or 

prohibiting foreign banking altogether).  Before turning to a discussion of how the shared 

approach has evolved and may be further modified, I think it useful to identify both the appeal 

and the problems with the other three, conceptually purer, approaches. 

 Both the attraction and limitations of the host country model are fairly apparent.  On the 

one hand, the host country is most likely to be attentive to the risks posed to its financial system 

by foreign banks.  More generally, the host jurisdiction is at least presumptively best positioned 

to craft a regulatory and supervisory framework to protect its financial system from the particular 

risks engendered by economic and financial conditions.  Having all foreign banking operations 

meet local capital and other standards helps achieve that end.  The risks of abrupt shifts of capital 

and liquidity out of the country can be minimized, and depositors can be better protected.   

On the other hand, a fully local regulatory system would make the costs of entry very 

high.  For example, if no foreign branches were allowed, or were required to operate as if they 

were separately chartered and capitalized, the commitment of resources needed to enter a foreign 

market would be considerably higher than those typically associated with opening a branch.  In 

addition, even complete local subsidiarization might not protect a foreign banking operation 

from suffering some contagion if its parent is under stress.  Thus, the quality of home country 

regulation may have some bearing even under the host country model. 

 Not surprisingly, the home country model presents essentially the obverse set of 

advantages and limitations.  Having a consolidated set of capital requirements and a single 

supervisor allows for the quickest deployment of capital and liquidity where it is most in 


 6  
 

demand, or most needed to relieve stress, and minimizes compliance costs.  However, as has 

often been pointed out, the home country regulator will be most responsive to the impact of both 

regulation and distress of its banks on its own market.  In its regulatory and resolution activities, 

it is likely to undervalue the potential risks and costs for host countries.  In periods of stress, the 

home country regulator, accountable primarily to home country legislators or government 

officials, may concentrate on stabilizing its own financial markets and be more inclined to allow, 

or even demand, a sharp reduction in activity abroad.  The result would, at a minimum, be an 

abrupt decrease in intermediation at particularly sensitive times.  At worst, foreign operations 

could default on obligations and exacerbate financial stress.3   

 At first glance, it might seem that the home country and global regulatory approaches 

would yield similar substantive results, since in each case, there would be consolidated 

regulation and supervision.  A global regulator, however, would at least in theory take the 

interests of all jurisdictions into account in regulating, supervising, and resolving a global bank.  

Of course, how to balance those interests--particularly in the face of unanticipated 

circumstances--would be a difficult, and almost invariably political, judgment.  This reality 

raises the thorny issue of the accountability of a global regulator. 

The political factor is one of many reasons why jurisdictions are likely to remain 

unwilling to cede much authority to global, as opposed to international, financial institutions.  

                                                 
3 Mindful of the considerations lying behind the limitations of both models, Dirk Schoenmaker has offered his 
theory of the “financial trilemma,” which states that a jurisdiction can only have two of the three objectives of a 
stable financial system, international banking, and national regulatory policies. Professor Schoenmaker introduced 
his theory at a conference in 2008 and subsequently formalized it in Dirk Schoenmaker (2011), “The Financial 
Trilemma,” Economics Letters, vol. 111 (April), pp. 57–59; and Dirk Schoenmaker (2013), Governance of 
International Banking: The Financial Trilemma (Oxford: Oxford University Press). See also Richard J. Herring 
(2007), “Conflicts between Home and Host Country Prudential Supervisors,” in Douglas D. Evanoff, George G. 
Kaufman, and John R. LaBrosse, eds., International Financial Stability: Global Banking and National Regulation, 
(Hackensack, N.J: World Scientific), pp. 201–20.

Indeed, quite apart from political considerations, there may be good reasons not to do so.  For 

one, a single global regulator of internationally active banks would presumably be something 

close to a regulatory monopolist, whose policies and practices could be inappropriately uniform 

across quite different national markets and slow to adapt to changing conditions.  Also, as with 

dominant or exclusive reliance on home country consolidated supervision, it seems unlikely that 

a global regulator--no matter how well-staffed--would be fully informed on the varieties of 

financial risks posed to regulated institutions across national markets. 

A limited exception to the general disinclination to cede financial sovereignty, as in 

various other areas, lies within the European Union or, more precisely, the euro zone.  With the 

creation of a Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) in the European Central Bank and a 

freestanding Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM), there have been important transfers of 

authority, though national regulators continue to play a supporting role.  Interesting and 

important as this regional initiative is, however, the unique European arrangement of shared 

sovereignty makes it less a model for the world as a whole than an extension of the single 

currency project, responding to some of the difficulties encountered during the financial crisis. 

The Shared Model and Lessons of the Crisis 

  The shortcomings of each conceptually “pure” model explains why some version of a 

shared home/host model has prevailed over time.  Given the range of variations in this model, 

however, it is useful to bear in mind the relative advantages and disadvantages of the cleaner 

models in choosing the elements of a specific shared approach.  In considering recent 


 8  
 

developments, as well as what remains to be done, it is also useful to begin by recalling the 

situation that prevailed at the onset of the financial crisis.  

In its early years, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s work focused on 

elaborating the responsibilities of home and host regulators of internationally active banks.  The 

principle of consolidated supervision was developed in the early 1980s, and reinforced following 

the failure of the BCCI in the early 1990s, in an effort to ensure that some regulatory authority 

had an overview of a global bank’s consolidated assets and liabilities.  At the same time, though, 

the Basel Committee set out expectations for host country prudential oversight of foreign banks 

that would be similar to that for domestic banks.4   

The financial crisis painfully demonstrated the inadequacy of both home and host country 

regulation.  Home country regulators of some large, internationally active banks clearly did not 

appreciate the risks those firms were assuming overseas.  Host country regulators, including 

those in the United States, had not exercised prudential oversight of some foreign bank activities 

and had not sufficiently appreciated the risks associated with the funding models and other 

activities of some foreign banks that were subject to consolidated prudential regulation.  And 

there were indeed instances of international bank failures in which the home country authorities 

seemed to focus on domestic interests to the possible detriment of the interests of host countries.5  

Of course, regulatory failures were far more pervasive than inattention to the specifically 

cross-border activities of banks.  The substantive rules governing capital and other requirements 

for all banks were woefully inadequate, although the fact that most very large banks around the 

                                                 
4 The current version of this obligation is set forth in Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2012), “Core 
Principles for Effective Banking Supervision” (Basel, Switzerland: Bank for International Settlements, September), 
www.bis.org/publ/bcbs230.htm.  I have addressed the issue of host state responsibility at somewhat greater length 
elsewhere.  Daniel K. Tarullo (2014), “Regulating Large Foreign Banking Organizations,” speech delivered at the

York, March 27, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20140327a.htm.

world have significant cross-border operations exacerbated the shortcomings.  While banks were 

growing in size, integrating traditional lending and capital markets in ever more complicated 

ways and relying increasingly on vulnerable short-term wholesale funding models, many 

regulators around the world were at best failing to keep up with these changes.  At worst, they 

removed older prudential limitations without substituting new measures designed to address the 

new realities of banking.  The Basel Committee spent most of the decade before the crisis 

dominantly focused on the Basel II framework, which was intended to reduce somewhat 

effective regulatory capital levels for large banks in return for their transition to an internal-

models-based approach to capital requirements.  This was a choice made by national regulators, 

led by those in the United States, and not a byproduct of the structure of the Basel Committee 

itself.  

Adding the lessons of the 2007–09 financial crisis to those of earlier episodes of financial 

stress, I think we can infer some guidelines on host and home responsibilities to help shape 

expectations for practice.  For host countries, the overarching guideline is that each jurisdiction 

should take responsibility for protecting the financial stability of its own markets as its 

contribution to achieving global financial stability.  The extent of this responsibility obviously 

increases with the size and significance of the jurisdiction’s financial markets.  Thus the United 

States and the United Kingdom--which currently have the greatest concentrations of capital 

markets activities--have a particular obligation to oversee the local activities of both domestic 

and foreign banks that could pose particular risks to financial stability and are likely to be 

especially difficult to observe for a home country supervisor less familiar with those markets. 

A corollary of this general guideline is that the scope of host country regulation might 

sensibly vary with the size and systemic importance of foreign banks.  This notion is consistent 


 10  
 

with the principle embodied in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 

Act that prudential regulation should be progressively more stringent as banks pose greater risks 

to financial stability.  As I will discuss in a moment, this principle also lies behind some of the 

post-crisis frameworks developed by the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board 

(FSB).   

For home countries, the relatively longstanding principle that regulators should exercise 

effective consolidated supervision remains critical, though I would emphasize that the regulation 

imposed by home jurisdictions is of equal--if not greater--importance.  It is important to 

emphasize that this obligation is not a substitute for host country regulation and supervision of 

foreign banking organizations.  The home jurisdiction regulatory structure must ensure that the 

banks are fundamentally safe and sound, and that the parent will generally be able to support its 

operations around the world.  Here, of course, a major shortcoming of the pre-crisis regime 

becomes apparent, in that capital and other regulatory requirements for internationally active 

banks were simply not strong enough.   

Consolidated supervision must contain the risks to the financial system created by 

banking activity that is not fully captured by regulations.  It must also ensure that banks do not 

hide problems by shifting assets or liabilities around their global operations and, more generally, 

that the banks are fundamentally safe and sound so as to forestall possible contagion risk to 

foreign operations.   

Within these admittedly broad guidelines, there is obviously room for host countries to 

balance the benefits and risks presented by foreign banking organizations in a number of 

different ways.  Their choices will be affected by policy preferences, the characteristics of their 

domestic financial systems, and the relative importance of foreign banks in those systems.  The 


 11  
 

host country choices will also inevitably be affected by how home countries are carrying out 

their regulatory and supervisory roles.  This consideration includes, of course, not just 

regulations that are nominally applicable, but the manner in which those regulations are 

enforced.   

Branching presents a particularly instructive example of the tension between assuring 

financial stability and permitting foreign banking operations that may carry economic benefits.  

Because branches are not separately chartered and capitalized, a bank can relatively easily enter 

a foreign market by opening a branch, through which it can make loans--often initially to 

companies from its home country--using funds from the home bank.  Particularly where (as in 

the United States) foreign branches are forbidden by local law from accepting retail deposits, it 

might seem that there are minimal risks to the host country if the parent bank (and thus the local 

branch) fails.  However, U.S. experience with foreign branches in the decade prior to the crisis 

shows the very real risks that can arise when a branch is used to raise funds in the host country 

(in the United States, in dollars) through short-term wholesale borrowing, and then directs those 

funds out of the host country for loans or asset purchases by other parts of the bank.  As noted 

earlier, when short-term funding dried up, many foreign branches were left seriously short of 

liquidity and had to turn to the discount window. 

A shared feature of the U.S. and European Union regulatory systems for foreign banks is 

that branching is permitted without requiring separate capitalization.  Many other jurisdictions 

have similar policies.  Thus opportunities for foreign bank entry and market access are provided.  

In the United States, larger branches do have to meet some liquidity requirements, though they 

are less restrictive than the standards applicable to domestic banks and intermediate holding 

companies.  This requirement is an important example of a prudential measure that balances 


 12  
 

financial stability and the benefits of international banking.  The degree to which we or, I 

presume, other jurisdictions will remain comfortable with this balance will depend on two 

factors.  The first factor is the degree to which local branches are used by foreign banks as 

significant sources of unstable funding or for other risky purposes.  While this has been a 

significant issue in the United States, it is less clear that other jurisdictions face similar risks.  

The second is the confidence host jurisdiction regulators have that the parent banks are subject to 

effective regulatory and supervisory oversight. 

Developments since the Crisis 

The profound shift in political and policy environments as a result of the financial crisis 

has led to considerable strengthening of minimum international standards for internationally 

active banks, at both national and international levels.  Basel III enhanced the quantity and 

quality of capital requirements and introduced, for the first time, quantitative liquidity standards.  

Following completion of Basel III, the Basel Committee developed a structure of slightly 

misleadingly named capital “surcharges,” which requires global systemically important banks 

(GSIBs) to maintain higher capital levels.6   

The Federal Reserve supported all these measures but was a particularly strong advocate 

of the capital surcharges, which established the new principle that some international prudential 

standards should be progressively more stringent as the systemic importance of a bank increases.  

In meeting its responsibility to promote domestic financial stability, the Federal Reserve last year 

followed the lead set by the European Union some years previously and adopted a regulation 

requiring subsidiaries of GSIBs engaged in traditional banking as well as those engaged in 

                                                 
6 I say “misleadingly” called capital surcharges because that term implies the banks are faced with a “charge” that 
has to be paid to someone.  In fact, of course, the requirement is that the bank retain higher capital buffers in order to 
increase its resiliency. 


 13  
 

capital markets activities be covered by local capital requirements consistent with Basel III.  But 

neither in the United States nor the European Union do the GSIB capital surcharges imposed at 

the consolidated level apply to foreign banking operations in their jurisdictions.7  So even if the 

global bank has local capital requirements for most or all of its foreign operations, the parent still 

has some flexibility as to where the additional capital buffer can be maintained.  More generally, 

our requirements for other prudential regulations applicable to foreign banking organizations 

(FBOs) are calibrated to the relative importance of the FBOs in the U.S. financial system.  Thus 

the structure of surcharges also help to create a good mechanism for balancing host country 

interests in assuring financial stability and in realizing the benefits that can come from global 

banking.   

Even with good standards, regulators in host jurisdictions will want assurance that these 

standards are being rigorously implemented and enforced.  The relative opaqueness of bank 

balance sheets makes capital, liquidity, and other common banking regulations difficult to 

monitor effectively.  This argues for complementing fairly complex regulation that seeks to track 

the often-complex activities of large banks with simpler regulations, such as the leverage ratio 

and a standardized risk-weighted capital floor.  But it also argues for existing international fora 

such as the Basel Committee and the FSB to provide effective monitoring mechanisms.  Even 

with higher standards in place, supervisors in home and host jurisdictions will still face 

challenges in assessing cross-jurisdiction vulnerabilities.  More regular sharing of information 

and assessments among home and key host jurisdictions both formally and informally should be 

high on our shared agenda.    

                                                 
7 See 79 FR 17240 (March 27, 2014); and Tarullo, “Regulating Large Foreign Banking Organizations.” 


 14  
 

At present, both those groups have useful processes for overseeing the implementation of 

agreed upon international standards.  But they tend to be a bit formalistic, concentrating on 

comparing the language of domestic implementation to that of the international standards, rather 

than examining whether domestic practice in fact ensures substantive compliance or gaining a 

shared understanding of the unique risks in each market.   

It would, I believe, be counterproductive to establish in either the Basel Committee or the 

FSB the kind of adversarial dispute settlement process associated, for example, with the World 

Trade Organization.  It is in the interest of all members of those bodies to cooperate in the shared 

task of overseeing internationally active banks.  Thus, the better approach to compliance would 

be one that simultaneously provides regulators with a way to work with one another and to gain 

deeper insight into how their counterparts in other jurisdictions are applying prudential 

standards.   

For example, there has been considerable documentation of the interjurisdictional 

divergence in risk weights for similar exposures under the internal models-based capital 

approaches of Basel II.8  While the Basel Committee has been working on this issue,9 I suspect 

that one of the most effective ways of promoting broadly comparable risk weighting would be to 

have technically competent supervisory staff from other jurisdictions participate with home 

regulators in the actual bank model validations, oversight, and related supervisory functions.  

Similarly, as stress testing becomes a more important global financial stability tool, it will be 

useful to have staff experienced in stress testing at home participating in the stress testing

Paper 12/90 (Washington: International Monetary Fund, March).

 15  
 

exercises of other jurisdictions.  These kinds of interactions, along with the more traditional 

device of supervisory colleges, can help foster confidence among host jurisdictions in both the 

regulatory and supervisory activities of home country authorities.  

Another useful practice for furthering mutual confidence would be a program for regular 

contact among the very top officials of key regulators.  The original Basel Committee brought 

together these officials for what were usually relatively informal meetings.  As one of the early 

participants in those meetings once told me, the relationships he built with his counterparts 

through these regular contacts served everyone well when issues concerning international banks 

arose.  But with the concentration of the Basel Committee on sometimes highly technical 

standards, participation has generally drifted down to the senior staff level.  The FSB was created 

in part to compensate for this change in the Basel Committee.  And the FSB usually does garner 

higher levels of participation.  However, other features of the FSB--such as including market 

regulators and finance ministries in order to provide a broader range of views on financial 

stability issues--mean that the FSB cannot serve the original Basel Committee purpose either.  

Moreover, even when the right member agencies are represented, the actual individuals 

participating may not be the most senior officials in the supervisory function of those agencies.  

Finally, the near doubling in size of both the Basel Committee and the FSB, while again critical 

for ensuring a representative group to consider financial stability issues, further complicates the 

matter. 

Thus, while a regular, high-level interaction among all key regulators would be optimal, 

for the foreseeable future, we will probably have to live with something less than optimal.  Ad 

hoc meetings around the fringes of various Basel convocations and bilateral interactions may 

have to suffice.  In this regard, I note the importance of the creation of the SSM within the 


 16  
 

European Central Bank as the supervisor for all larger banks in the euro zone.  The Federal 

Reserve has already established instructive and productive relationships with the experienced 

and committed group of supervisors that have been brought in to lead the SSM. 

The Limits of Shared Responsibility 

It is important to recognize, though, that even with the best of intentions and actions in 

home country regulatory and supervisory regimes, there will be limits to how much 

responsibility can appropriately be shared for international banking activities.  These limits are 

most apparent in the context of the possible insolvency of a major foreign banking 

organization.10  The work of the FSB in promoting effective resolution regimes around the world 

and in seeking an international framework for building the total loss absorbing capacity (TLAC) 

of GSIBs are very good examples of cooperative efforts that promote the aim of ensuring that 

even the largest banks can fail without either causing financial disorder or requiring injection of 

public capital.  My expectation is that the FSB’s framework for TLAC will incorporate the 

principle of an extra buffer of loss absorbing capacity at the consolidated level beyond what may 

be required in the aggregate at local levels.11  But the margin may be a little thinner here, 

precisely because of the circumstances in which the loss absorption capacity may be needed. 

With respect to going concern prudential requirements such as capital levels, host 

countries have a continuing opportunity to observe how home country officials are regulating 

and supervising their banks.  Particularly if effective monitoring mechanisms are developed, host 

countries may become comfortable with limited oversight of some or all domestic operations of 

                                                 
10 Indeed, Dirk Schoenmaker developed his notion of the financial trilemma around the conflicts of interest that arise 
in the context of the insolvency of a global bank. 
11 The TLAC proposal of the FSB contemplates that host authorities will set internal TLAC requirements at 75 to 90 
percent of applicable external TLAC requirements. 
 


 17  
 

foreign banks.  If they see the rigor of home consolidated oversight waning, they will have a 

chance to intensify their own supervision.  But with the prospect of a failed bank, there will be 

no time for such adjustments or, as a practical matter, the capacity to impose new requirements 

may become limited by the time the prospect of failure is looming.  The imposition of 

requirements in the midst of a crisis would in any event likely exacerbate stress.  Even with the 

best of intentions, today’s home country regulators cannot effectively bind their successors’ 

response to the insolvency of one of their globally important banks when political and economic 

pressures are likely to be high.   

The gone-concern loss absorbency requirement for FBO intermediate holding companies 

proposed by the Federal Reserve Board on October 30 should enhance the prospects for an 

orderly firmwide global resolution of an FBO by its home country resolution authority through 

increasing confidence that the U.S. operations of the FBO will obtain their appropriate share of 

the loss absorbency capacity of the consolidated foreign bank.  Past experience suggests that host 

supervisors are most likely to ringfence assets when there is doubt that the local customers and 

counterparties of foreign banks will be adequately taken into account.  Yet if, for any reason, the 

home jurisdiction resolution is unsuccessful, the internal long-term debt will be available to U.S. 

authorities for orderly resolution and recapitalization of the intermediate holding companies.   

We have calibrated our proposed internal TLAC requirements slightly below our 

proposed external TLAC requirements for U.S. GSIBs.  This slightly lower calibration for 

internal TLAC recalls the difference between local going-concern capital requirements and the 

GSIB surcharge, but the gap is somewhat smaller, reflecting the concerns I mentioned a moment 

ago.  The proposal thus balances support for the preferred resolution strategy of the home

resolution authority of the foreign GSIB with assurance of U.S. financial stability if that strategy 

cannot be executed successfully.12 

Conclusion 

 My view of shared responsibility for overseeing international banks emphasizes the 

importance of financial stability even as it allows for benefits specific to international banking.  

For the reasons I have explained, in the end host countries need to make the judgments on the 

tradeoffs between these goals.  But I have also explained how a strong set of international 

prudential standards and good institutional relationships among regulators could help tilt this 

balance toward greater flexibility for internationally active banks. 

 In response to positions akin to what I have presented today, one often hears complaints 

that the emphasis on financial stability will result in the balkanization of international banking.  I 

would note first that it is not at all clear that developments since the crisis have on net balkanized 

banking, so much as shifted some international banking assets from the Organisation for 

Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries whose banks were 

disproportionately affected by the financial crisis to banks from some emerging market and 

developing countries.13  This development probably reflects both needed changes in some of the 

OECD nation banks and a logical reflection of the increasing economic importance of the non-

OECD countries.   

 Second, I wonder how these critics can think that the pre-crisis situation of supposedly 

consolidated oversight and substantial bank flexibility was a desirable one.  At least some of the 

                                                 
12 Our internal TLAC proposal effects this balance principally by not including parent GSIB surcharges in the 
calibration for FBO intermediate holding companies but also by lowering the baseline TLAC requirement for U.S. 
intermediate holding company subsidiaries of single-point-of-entry strategy FBOs from 18 percent of risk-weighted 
assets to 16 percent of risk-weighted assets.

Banking Globalization.”

flexibility enjoyed by banks in shifting capital and liquidity around the globe was deployed in 

pursuit of unsustainable activity that eventually ran badly aground.   

 Third, as I suggested earlier, even where concerns about “trapped” capital or liquidity are 

more sensibly based, reasonable ex ante constraints by host country authorities in pursuit of a 

sound and stable domestic financial system are likely to be far preferable to ex post constraints--

for example, ringfencing--that are imposed when the foreign bank is under the greatest pressure.
