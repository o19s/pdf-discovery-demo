Thank you for the opportunity to speak here at the Economic Club of New York.  

Today I will discuss the ongoing progress of our economy and the prospects for returning 

both the federal funds rate and the size of the Fed’s balance sheet to more normal levels.  

As always, the views I express here are mine and not necessarily those of the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC). 

Economic Developments 

The Federal Reserve is committed to fulfilling our statutory mandate of stable 

prices and maximum employment.  To begin with the labor market, many indicators 

suggest that the economy is close to full employment.  In April, the unemployment rate 

was 4.4 percent, a level not reached since May 2007 and below most current estimates of 

the natural rate of unemployment (figure 1).1  Estimates of the natural rate are inherently 

uncertain, but other labor market measures are also near their pre-crisis levels, including 

a broader measure of labor market underutilization that includes those who would like to 

work but have not recently looked for a job and those working part time who want full-

time work.2  The labor force participation rate, which had declined sharply after the 

crisis, has now been roughly stable for 3-1/2 years, which represents an improvement 

                                                 
1 For example, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the natural rate of unemployment is 
currently 4.7 percent.  The March 2017 Blue Chip Economic Indicators reported that the consensus forecast 
for the unemployment rate over 2024 to 2028 was 4.7 percent, with the top 10 projections averaging 
5.1 percent and the bottom 10 averaging 4.3 percent.  The median estimate of the longer-run normal rate of 
unemployment in the March 2017 Summary of Economic Projections was 4.7 percent.  The uncertainty 
around these estimates is large. The canonical paper by Staiger, Stock, and Watson puts the 95 percent 
confidence interval at 1-1/2 percentage points on either side of the point estimate; see Douglas Staiger, 
James H. Stock, and Mark W. Watson (1997), “How Precise Are Estimates of the Natural Rate of 
Unemployment?” in Christina D. Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation:  Motivation and 
Strategy (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press).  
2 The broader measure is the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ U-6 alternative measure of labor underutilization.

against its estimated downward trend (figure 2).  Participation is now close to estimates 

of its trend level.3  

Wage data have gradually moved up, consistent with a tightening labor market.  

Although average hourly earnings are rising only about 2.5 percent per year, slower than 

before the crisis, much of that downshift may reflect the slowdown in productivity 

growth we have experienced.  For example, over the past three years, unit labor costs--

that is, nominal wages adjusted for increases in productivity--have been generally rising a 

bit faster than prices.4   

Turning to inflation, the FOMC interprets price stability to mean inflation of 2 

percent as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE).5  

This objective is symmetric, so the Committee would be concerned if inflation were to 

run persistently above or below this target.  Inflation has run below 2 percent for most of 

the period since the financial crisis, reflecting generally soft economic conditions as well 

as transitory factors such as the earlier declines in energy prices.  But over the past two 

years, inflation has moved gradually closer to our objective.  Prices rose 1.6 percent over 

                                                 
3 The labor force participation rate is currently slightly below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate 
of trend and slightly above trend estimates based on the methodology of Aaronson and others.  See 
Congressional Budget Office (2017), The Budget and Economic Outlook:  2017 to 2027 (Washington:  
CBO, January), https://www.cbo.gov/publication/52370; and Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce 
Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith, and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation:  
Recent Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 197-275, 
https://www.brookings.edu/bpea-articles/labor-force-participation-recent-developments-and-future-
prospects. 
4 There are several other measures of nominal wage growth in addition to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ 
(BLS) average hourly earnings.  The BLS employment cost index measure of year-over-year wage and 
salary growth was also 2.5 percent in the first quarter, while the BLS measure of compensation per hour 
rose to 3.9 percent.  Compensation per hour is quite volatile and subject to large revisions.  The unit labor 
cost measure is based on the BLS measures of compensation per hour and productivity for the business 
sector.  All of these measures indicate that compensation has picked up in recent years.

the 12 months ending in April, compared with only 0.2 percent two years earlier 

(figure 3).  But much of that movement reflects price changes in the often-volatile energy 

and food components of the index.  Core inflation, which excludes food and energy 

prices, has proven historically to be a better indicator of where overall inflation is 

heading, although it, too, can be affected by transitory factors such as import prices.  

Core inflation was 1.5 percent for the 12 months through April.  This measure has also 

risen since 2015, although its gradual increase appears to have paused because of weak 

inflation readings for March and April.  Some of the recent weakness can be explained by 

transitory factors.  And there are good reasons to expect that inflation will resume its 

gradual rise.  Incoming spending data have been relatively strong, and the labor market 

should continue to tighten, exerting some upward pressure on wages and prices.  

Nonetheless, it is important that the Committee assess incoming inflation data carefully 

and continue to demonstrate a strong commitment to achieving our symmetric 2 percent 

objective. 

Despite strong job gains, very weak productivity gains have led to disappointingly 

slow economic growth of only about 2 percent over the course of this expansion 

(figure 4).  While monetary policy can contribute to growth by supporting a durable 

expansion in a context of price stability, it cannot reliably affect the long-run sustainable 

level of the economy’s growth.6  The success of monetary policy should be judged by the 

                                                 
6 I have argued elsewhere that we need to find ways to increase our long-term growth and spread that 
prosperity broadly if we are to avoid this “low growth trap.”  We need policies that support business 
investment, labor force participation, and productivity growth.  Increased spending on public infrastructure 
may raise private-sector productivity over time.  Greater support for public and private research and 
development, encouragement of workers to increase their skills, and policies that improve product and 
labor market dynamism may also be fruitful.  See Jerome H. Powell (2016), “Recent Economic 
Developments and Longer-Run Challenges,” speech delivered at the Economic Club of Indiana,

economy’s performance against our statutory mandates of price stability and maximum 

employment.  Today, the economy is as close to our assigned goals as it has been for 

many years (figure 5).   

My baseline expectation is that the economy will continue on a path of growth of 

about 2 percent, strong job creation and tightening labor markets, and inflation moving 

up toward our 2 percent target.  I expect that unemployment will decline a bit further and 

remain at low levels for some time, which could draw more workers into the workforce, 

put upward pressure on wages, or cause businesses to invest more as labor costs rise, all 

of which I would view as desirable outcomes.  Risks to the forecast now seem more 

balanced than they have been for some time.  In particular, the global picture has 

brightened as growth and inflation have broadly moved up for the first time in several 

years.  Here at home, risks seem both moderate and balanced, including the downside 

risk of lower inflation and the upside risk of labor market overheating.      

Monetary Policy Normalization 

The healthy state of our economy and favorable outlook suggest that the FOMC 

should continue the process of normalizing monetary policy.  The Committee has been 

patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends.  While the recent 

performance of the labor market might warrant a faster pace of tightening, inflation has 

been below target for five years and has moved up only slowly toward 2 percent, which 

argues for continued patience, especially if that progress slows or stalls.  If the economy 

performs about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise 

rates.  I would also see it as appropriate to begin the process of reducing the size of the 


 - 5 - 

balance sheet later this year.  Of course, both decisions will depend on the performance 

of the economy. 

To put this process in context, consider where we have come from.  Ten years 

ago, in the summer of 2007, we were just entering the most painful economic crisis since 

the Great Depression.  The crisis and its aftermath prompted large-scale policy 

interventions by the Federal Reserve and other authorities to avert the collapse of the 

financial system and prevent the economy from spiraling into depression. 

Most of the Federal Reserve’s targeted financial measures--such as liquidity 

facilities to ensure the flow of credit to households and businesses--were withdrawn soon 

after the crisis as orderly conditions resumed in financial markets.  In contrast, the 

FOMC’s easing of monetary policy increased over time as the longer-term economic 

effects of the crisis gradually became clear.  From 2007 through 2013, the FOMC added 

ever greater support for the economy.7  From late 2008, with rates pinned at the zero 

lower bound, the Committee resorted to unconventional policies to put additional 

downward pressure on long-term rates, including strong calendar-based forward guidance 

regarding the likely future path of the federal funds rate, and several rounds of large-scale 

asset purchases (often referred to as quantitative easing (QE)).8   

Both the federal funds rate and the balance sheet are currently set at levels 

intended to provide significant support to economic activity.  Normalization of the stance 

                                                 
7 A chronology of changes in the FOMC’s target federal funds rate is available on the Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/openmarket.htm. 
8 The FOMC’s purchases of longer-term securities (U.S. Treasury securities, agency debt obligations, and 
agency-guaranteed mortgage-backed securities) reduced the outstanding stock of these securities available 
in the market and therefore tended to put upward pressure on bond prices and downward pressure on their 
yields--specifically, on the term premium component of longer-term interest rates.  This unconventional 
monetary policy was an appropriate means of providing a boost to spending by households and firms 
during a period of economic slack, when our ability to provide accommodation by conventional means was 
limited by the fact that the federal funds rate had reached almost zero. 


 - 6 - 

of monetary policy will return both tools to a more neutral setting over time.  That 

process can be said to have begun in 2014, when the FOMC ended its asset purchases and 

began active discussions on lifting the federal funds rate from its lower bound.9  Our first 

rate hike came in December 2015, with another in December 2016, and one additional 

increase so far this year.  The normalization process is projected to have several years left 

to run. 

In the case of the federal funds rate, the endpoint of that process will occur when 

our target reaches the long-run neutral rate of interest.  Estimates of that rate are subject 

to significant uncertainty.  The median estimate of its level by FOMC participants in 

March was 3 percent, more than a full percentage point below pre-crisis estimates.  This 

decline in the long-run neutral rate, and an even larger decline in the short-run neutral 

rate, imply that even the very low rates of recent years may be providing less support to 

the economy than may appear.  At present, the median FOMC participant estimates that 

we will reach a long-run neutral level by year-end 2019 if the economy performs about as 

expected (figure 6).    

The Balance Sheet 

In September 2014, the FOMC outlined its plans for the balance sheet.  That 

initial guidance has been supplemented over time in other FOMC communications, most 

recently in the minutes of the May meeting.  Here is a summary of the key points: 

                                                 
9 Over this period, the size of the balance sheet has been maintained by our reinvestment policy, which I 
will consider later in the remarks. 


 - 7 - 

• Normalization of the balance sheet will commence only after the 

normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.10  Most 

FOMC participants think that this condition will be satisfied later this year if 

the economy continues broadly on its current path.11   

• The balance sheet will be allowed to shrink passively as our holdings of 

Treasury and agency securities mature (or prepay) and roll off.12   

• The process will be gradual and predictable.  As noted in the May minutes, 

although no decisions have been made, the Committee has discussed 

preannouncing a schedule of gradually increasing caps on the dollar value of 

securities that would be allowed to run off in a given month.   

• The Committee will continue to use the federal funds rate as its principal tool 

for adjusting the stance of monetary policy.13     

• Once the process of balance sheet normalization has begun, it should continue 

as planned as long as there is no material deterioration in the economic 

outlook.14

• In the long run, the balance sheet should be no larger than it needs to be to 

allow the Committee to conduct monetary policy under its chosen 

framework.15 

Taken together, the Committee’s communications present the broad outline of our 

likely approach to normalizing the balance sheet.  Although the process of normalizing 

the size of the balance sheet will be in the background, that process will interact with the 

Committee’s decisions regarding the federal funds rate.  As the Fed’s balance sheet 

shrinks, so debt held by the public will grow, which in theory should tighten financial 

conditions by putting upward pressure on long-term rates.  Any such tightening could 

affect the Committee’s decisions on the federal funds rate.  But how big is this effect 

likely to be? 

Model-based approaches to that question estimate changes to financial conditions 

through increases in the term premium as the balance sheet shrinks.  These estimates vary 

but are generally modest.16  One reason is that, for several years, the FOMC has signaled 

its intention to normalize the balance sheet as economic conditions allow, and so some of 

the effects of normalization should already be priced in.  A recent research paper by 

Federal Reserve staff estimated that unconventional policies are holding down term

and Plans,” in note 12.

premiums by about 100 basis points, but that these effects should decline to about 

85 basis points by the end of 2017 as market participants see the normalization process 

approaching.17  The same approach suggests that bringing forward the date of the start of 

the anticipated phasing out of the Federal Reserve’s reinvestments from mid-2018 to the 

end of 2017 should have raised the term premium by only about 5 basis points.18  Of 

course, markets sometimes react quite differently than expected, as the 2013 taper 

tantrum showed.   

The market’s response to recent changes in expectations for reinvestment policy 

also suggests that there need not be a major reaction when the Committee begins to phase 

out reinvestments.  Long-term rates did not react strongly to the reinvestment discussions 

in the minutes for the FOMC’s March and May meetings, which led market participants 

to bring forward their expectations about the starting date for this process by about six 

months (figure 7).19  A recent survey of economists also suggests that they expect that a 

gradual, well-telegraphed reduction in the Fed’s balance sheet should have modest 

effects.20  These results augur well for an orderly phaseout of reinvestments.  If changes 

to reinvestment policy do tighten financial conditions more than anticipated, then I expect 

that the FOMC would take that into account.     

                                                 
17 See Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei, “Effect of the Federal Reserve’s Securities Holdings,” in note 16. 
18 Of course, estimates of the effects of monetary policy on term premiums often differ.  Engen, Laubach, 
and Reifschneider estimated that the Federal Reserve’s asset purchases are currently holding down term 
premiums by about 60 basis points, less than the estimate of Bonis, Ihrig, and Wei, but their findings still 
imply a similar small effect of bringing forward the date of normalization by six months; see Bonis, Ihrig, 
and Wei, “Effect of the Federal Reserve’s Securities Holdings,” and Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider, 
“Macroeconomic Effects,” in note 16.

The Long-Run Framework 

Over the next few years, the runoff of assets acquired through QE is expected to 

reduce the balance sheet substantially below its current level of $4.5 trillion.  In the long 

run, the ultimate size of the balance sheet will depend mainly on the demand for Federal 

Reserve liabilities--currency, reserves, and other liabilities--and on the Committee’s long-

run framework for setting interest rates.21   

The next slide compares the Fed’s balance sheet of May 2007 with that of May 

2017 (figure 8).  On the asset side, the balance sheet increased by about $3.5 trillion as 

the FOMC acquired securities in its QE programs.  These assets were matched on the 

liability side of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet by a $2.2 trillion increase in reserve 

balances held by commercial banks, a $700 billion increase in currency outstanding, and 

a $500 billion increase in other liabilities.   

As can be seen more clearly in the next slide, prior to the crisis, currency was the 

Fed’s main liability (figure 9).  Currency outstanding has nearly doubled over the past 10 

years to $1.5 trillion, growing at a compound annual rate of 6.8 percent.  This growth 

reflects strong domestic and international demand for U.S. currency, which is expected to 

continue.  The eventual level of demand for reserves is less certain but is highly likely to 

exceed pre-crisis levels when reserve balances averaged only about $15 billion.  Reserves 

are the ultimate “safe asset,” and demand for safe assets has increased substantially over 

time because of long-run trends, including regulatory requirements.  Other liabilities 

                                                 
21 For a more detailed discussion of the longer-run framework, see Lorie K. Logan (2017), “Implementing 
Monetary Policy:  Perspective from the Open Market Trading Desk,” speech delivered at the Money 
Marketeers of New York University, New York, May 18,

include the Treasury General Account, the foreign repurchase agreement (or repo) pool, 

balances held at the Fed by designated financial market utilities, and other items.   

To gain a sense of the possible long-run size of the balance sheet, the next slide 

shows simulations under three different assumptions for the ultimate level of reserve 

balances:  $100 billion, $600 billion, and $1 trillion (figure 10).22  These simulations 

show that, due to the growth of currency and other liabilities, the balance sheet will 

remain considerably above its pre-crisis levels even if reserves were to fall back to $100 

billion (the black line).  At its current growth rate, currency in circulation would reach $2 

trillion by 2022 and $2.8 trillion in 2027.  Even in the low case in which reserves decline 

to $100 billion, our balance sheet would be about $2.4 trillion in 2022 and would grow 

from there in line with currency demand.  If the long-run level of reserves is $600 billion 

in 2022, then the balance sheet would be about $2.9 trillion.23  

The appropriate long-run level of reserves will also depend on the operating 

framework the Committee chooses.  Before the crisis, reserves were scarce, and the 

Committee used open market operations to control the federal funds rate by managing 

                                                 
22 The intermediate figure of $600 billion is based on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s May 2017 
surveys of primary dealers and market participants.  Following the 2017 study by Ferris, Kim, and 
Schlusche, the federal funds rate path used in the balance sheet simulations consists of the modal path 
given in the FOMC participants’ Summary of Economic Projections (SEP); see Erin E. Syron Ferris, Soo 
Jeong Kim, and Bernd Schlusche (2017), “Confidence Interval Projections of the Federal Reserve Balance 
Sheet and Income,” FEDS Notes (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, 
January 13), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/2380-7172.1875.  In the simulations shown here, the SEP used 
pertains to the projections submitted in conjunction with the March 2017 FOMC meeting.  All three of the 
simulated balance sheet paths shown are predicated on a 12-month reinvestment phaseout commencing in 
late 2017.  The FRB/US model is used to generate the associated paths of the 10-year Treasury yield as 
well as the paths of other financial and macroeconomic variables.  Different paths of these variables imply 
different trajectories of the balance sheet, in part by changing the implied path of currency in circulation.  
Other assumptions used in generating the simulations are like those described in Ferris, Kim, and Schlusche 
(2017).  The time of balance sheet normalization is defined as the point at which reserve balances decline to 
their assumed terminal value.  Both in Ferris, Kim, and Schlusche (2017) and in the illustration here, the 
evolution of the balance sheet is represented by the path of the Federal Reserve’s System Open Market 
Account holdings. 
23 In the simulations from which these values are obtained, it is assumed that some prominent items in the 
“Other liabilities” category diminish to zero by the end of 2022.

reserve supply.  This process was operationally and resource intensive for the Desk and 

its counterparties.  As a consequence of QE, however, reserves have been highly 

abundant and will remain so for some years.  To affect financial conditions, the Federal 

Reserve has therefore used administered rates, including the interest rate paid on excess 

reserves (IOER) and, more recently, the offering rate of the overnight reverse repurchase 

agreement (ON RRP) facility.  This approach, sometimes referred to as a “floor system,” 

is simple to operate and has provided good control over the federal funds rate.  In 

November 2016, when the Committee discussed using a floor system as part of its 

longer-run framework, I was among those who saw such an approach as “likely to be 

relatively simple and efficient to administer, relatively straightforward to communicate, 

and effective in enabling interest rate control across a wide range of circumstances.”24  

Some have advocated a return to a framework similar to the pre-2007 system, in 

which the volume of reserves would likely be far below its present level and the federal 

funds rate would be managed by frequent open market operations.25  This “corridor” 

framework remains a feasible option, although, in my view, it may be less robust over 

time than a floor system.   

Concluding Remarks 

After a tumultuous decade, the economy is now close to full employment and 

price stability.  The problems that some commentators predicted have not come to pass.  

Accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather,

it helped restore full employment and return inflation closer to our 2 percent goal.  The 

current discussions of the normalization of monetary policy are a result of that success.
