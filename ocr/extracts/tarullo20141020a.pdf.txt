Good Compliance, Not Mere Compliance 


Remarks by

Federal Reserve Bank of New York Conference, “Reforming Culture and Behavior in the 

Financial Services Industry” 



New York, N.Y.





In the aftermath of the financial crisis, ongoing increases in capital buffers, reductions in 

funding vulnerabilities, improvements in risk management, and attention to orderly resolution 

are producing a substantially more resilient financial system.  Yet even as the financial position 

of firms has been strengthened, headlines describing misconduct in financial firms have appeared 

with disturbing regularity.  For a time, these stories were the legacy of pre-crisis errors and 

misdeeds, with a focus on the mortgages and mortgage-related products that lay at the heart of 

the crisis.  But soon they were accompanied by allegations of post-crisis actions: rigging of 

LIBOR (London interbank offered rate) and foreign exchange rates, facilitation of tax evasion, 

inadequate controls on money laundering, and front running through dark pools, among others. 

A pattern of antitrust, market regulatory, and consumer protection problems would of 

course be troubling in any firm or industry.  From a prudential regulatory perspective, such a 

pattern in financial institutions creates additional concerns, particularly as it poses a threat to 

continued progress toward a safer and more stable financial system.  It is noteworthy that 

supervisory assessments of risks to the earnings and balance sheets of major financial institutions 

have, like those of many private analysts, placed increasing emphasis on exposure to public fines 

and private litigation losses.  And senior management is surely diverted from the challenges of 

fashioning sound business strategies when major legal problems arise. 

Behind much of this malfeasance lies something other than the excessive credit and 

market risk that led to the crisis itself, although there may be some common roots of these 

problems.  The hypothesis that this is all the result of “a few bad apples,” an explanation I heard 

with exasperating frequency a year or two ago, has I think given way to a realization within 

many large financial firms that they have not taken steps sufficient to ensure that the activities of 

their employees remain within the law and, more broadly, accord with the values of probity,


- 2 - 




customer service, and ethical conduct that most of them espouse on their websites and in their 

television commercials.  

Today’s conference addresses the sources of the problems and some of the corrective 

measures that have been, or might be, taken by both firms and regulators.  While the title of the 

conference refers to both “culture” and “behavior,” I am going to focus mostly on the behavior 

that regulators and the public can observe, since culture is a somewhat contested academic 

concept and, however defined, is difficult to observe and assess from the outside.  It is the 

behavior of the employees of banking organizations with which we, as regulators, are ultimately 

concerned, since it is only through its employees that a firm can act.  Where there is significant 

incidence of behavior that violates laws or regulations, or runs afoul of supervisory guidance, 

then we will need to consider some combination of tougher sanctions, additional regulation, or 

more intrusive supervisory oversight.   

After stating a few general premises relating to the manifold influences upon behavior in 

financial firms, I will briefly address two topics: first, what regulators have learned about the 

shaping of behavior within the firm from our work on risk management and, second, the role of 

reward and punishment systems in affecting employee behavior. 

Influences on Behavior 

Without attempting a rigorous definition of “culture” or “corporate culture,” I think we 

can usefully posit that in every organization there is a set of norms that appear to inform 

behavior of those within the organization, even in the absence of explicit and specific rules or 

instructions.  These norms are of course related to the rules, guidelines, structures, incentives, 

and punishments that the organization creates.  Indeed, one important determinant of behavior is 

the shared expectation as to which of the stated values and rules of an organization will be 


- 3 - 




supported and reinforced by management action, and which are generally regarded as window 

dressing.  The identifiable norms may well differ within an organization, especially a large one 

in which different functions are performed in pursuit of overall organizational ends.   

Debates over the sources and nature of these norms are the stuff of the academic 

literature to which I referred a moment ago.  I will not attempt to synthesize this learning, much 

less to fashion my own theory.  Again, though, I think one can pragmatically note that these 

norms are shaped by both internal choices and external influences and constraints.   

For a private, profit-making corporation the most important internal choices are 

obviously made by management under the oversight of the board of directors.  However, the 

revealed preferences and choices of employees will also affect a firm’s culture.  For a financial 

institution, external influences and constraints include shareholders and market analysts, 

regulators, prosecutors, elected officials, the media, and the public.  Market conditions and the 

actions of competitors can also be significant.   

Nature of Risk Management 

Financial risk-taking is arguably the fundamental activity of financial intermediaries.1  

Unlike most non-financial firms, a financial institution more or less continually makes risk 

decisions, whose implications can vary significantly based on the nature of the asset involved, 

market conditions, counterparty identity, and many other factors.  The processes by which risk 

appetites are set and activity managed so as to conform to these risk appetite decisions are central 

to determining outcomes, and thus the firm’s near-term profitability and longer-term stability. 

For these reasons, there is considerable regulatory interest in these processes, an interest 

that has been formalized in the Federal Reserve’s annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and

assuming risk, but they are creating it for their investors.

Review (CCAR) and informs the emphasis of our supervision throughout the year.  Each year, in 

conjunction with our supervisory stress tests, we provide an assessment to every participating 

firm of their risk-management and capital planning processes, indicating where specific 

improvements are needed.  The interactions between supervisors and firms on these matters are 

extensive, focused, and consequential.  For this reason, I think we have gained considerable 

insight into, if not precisely the “culture” of the firms, then at least the attitudes of senior and 

mid-level management toward these risk functions.  

In some firms the attitude we perceive is one of a mere compliance exercise.  The firm 

proceeds to address the deficiencies identified by the Fed in a discrete, almost check-the-box 

fashion.  To oversimplify a bit, I would say that our sense is that management at these firms 

wants the hurdle to capital distribution removed, but once the specific problems have been 

remedied, they want to move on.  If this is the attitude we perceive, I suspect the working level 

employees of such firms do the same.  The supervisory reaction in such cases is quite likely to be 

an inclination toward greater scrutiny. 

Other firms, by contrast, seem to have internalized the aims of the risk-management 

processes and systems that we expect of them.  In these firms the dialogue can be quite different, 

with supervisors observing that, even as a specific problem is addressed, such as deficiencies in 

estimating losses for a particular loan portfolio in a tail event, the firm has gone back to think 

about how the identified shortcomings fit into their overall risk decision-making and 

management processes.  These firms will, on their own, then consider whether changes in other 

areas are needed.  Again, I suspect that the line employees in these firms are also hearing a 

different message and presumably, to at least some degree, will behave in accordance with that 


- 5 - 




message when they encounter risk-management issues not covered specifically by Fed 

communications. 

Needless to say, nothing here is meant to suggest that a focus on compliance is 

problematic.  On the contrary, particularly as applied to areas like antitrust, securities laws, and 

consumer protection, well-crafted compliance programs are essential.  But what we want to see 

is good compliance, not mere compliance.  As in financial risk management, the perceived 

importance of what appear to be similar compliance efforts can vary greatly across firms.  Are 

compliance programs put in place by risk managers or general counsels understood as a kind of 

background noise that should not drown out the voices urging employees to “make their 

numbers,” or are they seen as reflecting the views and priorities of senior management? 

A related question is whether compliance with applicable law or regulations is 

understood to be just that, and that alone.  Do employees understand their job to be maximizing 

revenues in any way possible so long as they do not do anything illegal, or do they understand 

their job to be maximizing revenues in a manner consistent with a broader set of considerations?  

In the former case, the message is that the law is a constraint to be observed, but that the 

purposes or values that underlie it have no additional importance for determining corporate 

activity.  It may not be too great a leap from this attitude to a conscious weighing of the 

profitability of a particular practice that violates laws or regulations against the penalty that 

would be assessed for the violation, discounted by the probability of enforcement.   

In the latter case, the message to employees is that constraints on practices or products 

may be self-imposed as well as external.  The potential sources of such internal constraints are 

manifold.  For example, there might be a fear that always running close to the line will inevitably 

result in swerving over it at some point.  Or management may worry that reputational harm will

result if clients and customers believe the firm is always seeking an advantage over them that, 

literally or metaphorically, is buried in the fine print.   

This second concern recalls the much-discussed issue of whether a trading mentality has 

migrated to other parts of large financial firms, so that the position communicated by 

management to both employees and others is that the firm has no “customers” or “clients,” only 

counterparties.  While such an attitude is typical for trading in anonymous markets or with 

equally sophisticated institutions, it hardly seems designed to engender trust on the part of those 

who have ongoing relationships with the firm.  This tendency may pose another challenge in 

managing complex banking organizations—the need to foster different kinds of norms and 

expectations across the different parts of the firm, which may do business with individuals and 

institutions of widely varying financial expertise. 

To encourage behavior among their employees that reflects something other than a 

narrow mentality of compliance and constraint, firms need to take tangible steps that reinforce 

stated norms such as respect for customers.  Some interesting possibilities along these lines are 

suggested in a recent book by Thomas Huertas, a former U.K. banking regulator.2  Although 

Huertas focuses directly on how banks can avoid suffering losses from conduct and operational 

risks, his proposals would also serve the purpose just noted.  One idea is that firms develop a 

score for conduct risk.  While analogous to long-established scoring systems for credit risk, this 

method would, in his words, “include ranking the business or product against factors that 

frequently give rise to conduct issues, including without limitation the sophistication of the 

customer, the complexity of the product, the level of training of the staff, and so on.”  A second, 

complementary idea is for the firm to have a formal system in place to, again in Huertas’ words,

“monitor adherence to the original product approval criteria, especially where the product is 

growing rapidly and/or is generating extraordinary profits.” 

These particular ideas may or may not be best for specific firms.  The point, though, is 

that some concrete organizational systems are needed for firms to carry into effective action the 

goals or values that they nominally espouse. 

Before leaving this topic, I want to observe that regulators can unwittingly reinforce what 

I have termed a mere compliance mentality.  I would first note that the detail of many regulations 

means that attention to narrow issues of compliance is sometimes wholly understandable and, 

indeed, essential.  Banks, like other regulated entities, need to be able to determine how a 

regulation actually applies to them.  Beyond that kind of unavoidable focus on narrow 

compliance, however, management and line employees are more likely to adopt a mere 

compliance mentality where regulations appear to them to have been poorly drafted or 

implemented.   

Sometimes this too is unavoidable, since regulators may simply conclude that the public 

interest requires a form of regulation opposed by the firm and most of its employees.  Sometimes 

regulated firms are really complaining about the type or purpose of regulation, even when they 

say they are only criticizing its specifics.  But in cases where those inside a firm would stipulate 

the stated objective of the regulation and still find a regulation badly conceived or implemented, 

there will be less possibility of internalization or integration into a broader set of firm norms and 

expectations.  This is an outcome that regulators can avoid, and something with which the 

regulated firms themselves can assist by pointing out what they would regard as more sensible 

methods for achieving stated regulatory purposes.

Rewards and Punishments 

 An important determinant of behavior in any organization is the system of rewards and 

punishments applicable to its employees.  Assuming that they are able to discern factors that 

generally explain patterns of hiring, raises, promotions, demotions, and dismissals, employees 

receive very strong signals as to what those running the organization actually value.  This set of 

signals has, I suspect, considerably more influence on employee behavior than a corporate 

statement of values or purposes, particularly if the system of rewards and punishments appears at 

odds with that statement.   

Indeed, the significance of reward and punishment signals is probably magnified by their 

role in shaping the composition of the firm’s workforce—by influencing which people are 

attracted to work at the firm in the first place, which acquire more authority over time, and which 

are asked to leave.  To take one example: if a financial firm’s recruitment of young professionals 

is driven almost entirely by promises of the large amounts of money they can make and the 

speed with which they can make it, then the firm should not be too surprised when those same 

young professionals give short shrift to values such as respect for customers, or skirt risk-

management guidelines, or perhaps even ignore regulatory and legal compliance requirements.   

One topic within this broader area of reward and punishment that has received 

considerable attention is incentive compensation.  The deleterious effects of many incentive 

compensation arrangements were recognized by firms well before regulators began to focus on 

them in earnest following the financial crisis, as reflected in a survey conducted early in 2009 on 

behalf of the Institute of International Finance, which reported that all but one of 37 large 

banking organizations believed that compensation practices were a factor underlying the crisis.3

for Change (Washington: IIF, March).

Compensation arrangements that created high-powered incentives using rewards 

dominantly based on equity had their origins in efforts to align better management and 

shareholder interests.  And compensation arrangements that rewarded incentives for loan officers 

to write more loans or traders to generate more trading revenue were grounded in efforts to 

increase firm profitability.  But the revenues that served as the basis for calculating bonuses were 

generated immediately, while the risks associated with these revenues might not have been 

realized for months or years after the transactions were completed.  When these or similarly 

misaligned incentive compensation arrangements were common in a firm, the very purpose of 

sound risk management could be undermined by the actions of employees seeking to maximize 

their own pay. 

Since the financial crisis, both firms and regulators have devoted considerable attention 

to incentive compensation practices for senior managers and others with substantial decision-

making authority.  Several years ago the bank regulatory agencies issued guidance on incentive 

compensation and then began a horizontal monitoring of practices at large banking 

organizations.4  Prior to the crisis, incentive compensation arrangements at many firms 

incorporated virtually no adjustment for risk.  Today, firms routinely take into consideration 

adverse outcomes.  A greater proportion of pay is deferred, and a greater proportion of that pay is 

at risk of a variety of clawback and forfeiture provisions.   

There is still considerable work to be done in developing and implementing incentive 

compensation arrangements that truly give appropriate incentives to employees.  In many cases 

risk metrics need to be better targeted to specific activities, and risk adjustments should be more

Supervision, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2010), “Federal Reserve, OCC, OTS, FDIC Issue Final

consistently applied.  And it is important that compensation arrangements, including clawback 

and forfeiture provisions, cover risks associated with market conduct and consumer protection, 

as well as credit and market risks.  These kinds of improvements would give more precise 

signals to employees as to the risk calculus expected of them in making decisions that affect the 

firm.  I hope the long-awaited interagency final rule implementing section 956 of the Dodd-

Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act will be forthcoming in the not-too-

distant future, so as to provide a common objective baseline for incentive compensation 

programs. 

Beyond regulatory and supervisory requirements, however, there is obviously more that 

firms can do to use their compensation practices to encourage certain practices and conduct by 

employees.  For example, firms might reward employees with increased compensation or 

promotion not just for increasing revenues, but also for forestalling losses, such as by identifying 

non-obvious risks in proposed transactions or products.  In order to be effective signals, though, 

the fact of these rewards, and the standards under which they were granted, need to be 

transparent. 

Punishment systems provide the complement of negative incentives to the positive 

incentives created by compensation and promotion practices (even where qualified by clawback 

or similar provisions).  Here the role of the government differs.  With respect to positive 

incentives, regulators affect individuals only by way of requirements or expectations for firms.  

When it comes to disincentivizing egregious bad behavior, however, the government can play a 

more direct role.  Because of the required standard of proof and other constitutional protections, 

criminal prosecutions of individuals are harder to bring successfully than criminal prosecutions 

of firms.  But, as I think was learned decades ago when individuals were criminally prosecuted 


- 11 - 




and imprisoned for antitrust law violations, it is difficult to imagine a more effective deterrent to 

such conduct. 

Banking regulators do not have criminal enforcement powers, of course.  But we can, and 

do, require dismissal of employees as part of our enforcement actions against firms.  And we do 

have the authorities to remove malefactors from their positions in any institution that we regulate 

and to prohibit them from working in the banking industry.  Somewhat like criminal 

prosecutions, these are not easy cases to make.  But it is important that we be willing to expend 

the resources to initiate such actions in appropriate cases.   

For quite some time, large banking organizations usually dismissed employees who had 

engaged in significant misconduct or exercised very bad judgment in a quiet, almost surreptitious 

way.  This was particularly true of someone in a responsible position, who would be ushered out 

the door discreetly, with no recognition internally or externally of the fact of dismissal, or the 

reasons behind it.  Frequently, this person would turn up at another financial firm not long 

thereafter.  The dismissing firm’s reasoning was that any public awareness of the dismissal could 

hurt the reputation of the firm and perhaps cause customers or counterparties to rethink their 

willingness to do business with it.  But the effect of this private way of doing things was to signal 

the rest of the firm’s employees that dismissal, even for very serious reasons, carried quite 

manageable consequences. 

At least some firms are rethinking this traditional approach, though different banks seem 

to be reaching different conclusions about what to put in its place.  Some are moving toward a 

more public system of dismissals, so as to let employees, regulators, and other potential 

employers know of the consequences of malfeasance and the identity of the responsible 

individual.  Others are inclined toward the view that, because most serious infractions in a firm 


- 12 - 




involve failures by many people and systems, there should not be excessive emphasis on the 

culpability of just one or two individuals.  They are opting instead for a more transparent internal 

process to dissect the failures of action, judgment, and oversight that lay behind a significant 

problem, and then act more broadly in applying disciplinary or remedial measures.  Whatever 

approach a firm takes, it is important that the consequences of violations of a firm’s norms and 

expectations, much less regulations and laws, be well-specified and clearly communicated to 

employees. 

Conclusion 

In these very selective remarks on the factors that affect employee behavior, I have 

intentionally concentrated on the roles of management and regulators.  I realize, of course, that 

there are other forces at work.  There is, for example, an interesting debate among corporate law 

professors as to the merits of giving shareholders more direct influence over firm policies, in 

order to reduce agency costs within the firm.  Some fear that this would focus employees of 

financial firms even more on short-term equity market movements, with potential bad effects on 

both conventional risk management and the kinds of conduct problems noted at the outset of my 

remarks.   

Those broader concerns are relevant, to be sure, but they implicate a broader set of actors 

than the banks themselves, or even bank regulators.  My expectation is that if banks do not take 

more effective steps to control the behavior of those who work for them, there will be both 

increased pressure and propensity on the part of regulators and law enforcers to impose more 

requirements, constraints, and punishments.
