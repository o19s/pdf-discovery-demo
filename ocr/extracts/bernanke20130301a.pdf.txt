Long-Term Interest Rates 




Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


Annual Monetary/Macroeconomics Conference:  The Past and Future of Monetary Policy 


Sponsored by Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco 


San Francisco, California 








March 1, 2013 





I will begin my remarks by posing a question:  Why are long-term interest rates so 

low in the United States and in other major industrial countries?   

At first blush, the answer seems obvious:  Central banks in those countries are 

pursuing accommodative monetary policies to boost growth and reduce slack in their 

economies.  However, while central banks certainly play a key role in determining the 

behavior of long-term interest rates, theirs is only a proximate influence.  A more 

complete explanation of the current low level of rates must take account of the broader 

economic environment in which central banks are currently operating and of the 

constraints that that environment places on their policy choices. 

Let me start with a brief overview of the recent history of long-term interest rates 

in some key economies.  Chart 1 shows the 10-year government bond yields for five 

major industrial countries:  Canada, Germany, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the 

United States.  Note that the movements in these yields are quite correlated despite some 

differences in the economic circumstances and central bank mandates in those countries.  

Further, with the notable exception of Japan, the levels of the yields have been very 

similar--indeed, strikingly so, with long-term yields declining over time and currently 

close to 2 percent in each case. The similar behavior of these yields attests to the global 

nature of the economic and financial developments of recent years, as well as to the broad 

similarity in how the monetary policymakers in the advanced economies have responded 

to these developments.  Of course, Japanese yields are clearly a case apart, as Japan has 

endured an extended period of deflation, while inflation in the other four countries has 

been positive and generally close to the stated objectives of the monetary authorities.  But

even Japanese yields have shown some tendency to fluctuate along with other benchmark 

yields, and they have also declined over the period shown.   

In my comments, I will delve more deeply into the reasons why these long-term 

interest rates have fallen so low.  This examination may be useful both for understanding 

the current stance of policy and also for thinking about how rates may evolve.  In short, 

we expect that as the economy recovers, long-term rates will rise over time to more 

normal levels.  A return to more normal conditions in financial markets would, of course, 

be most welcome.  Many commentators have noted, however, that both an extended 

period of low rates and the transition back toward normal levels may pose risks to 

financial stability.  In the final portion of my remarks, I will discuss some aspects of how 

the Federal Reserve is approaching these risks. 

Why Are Long-Term Interest Rates So Low? 

So, why are long-term interest rates currently so low?  To help answer this 

question, it is useful to decompose longer-term yields into three components:  one 

reflecting expected inflation over the term of the security; another capturing the expected 

path of short-term real, or inflation-adjusted, interest rates; and a residual component 

known as the term premium.  Of course, none of these three components is observed 

directly, but there are standard ways of estimating them.  Chart 2 displays one version of 

this decomposition of the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield based on a term structure model 

developed by Federal Reserve staff.

  The broad features I will emphasize are similar to 

those found by other authors using a variety of methods.

 Estimates are based on the model of D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2010).  That model employs the “arbitrage-

free” term structure framework and jointly models real yields, nominal yields, and inflation as functions of 

four underlying latent factors.  Historical data on nominal yields, real yields, and inflation can be used to 

estimate these underlying factors and the relationship of real and nominal yields to the factors.  Based on 


 - 3 - 

All three components of the 10-year yield have declined since 2007.  The 

decomposition attributes much of the decline in the yield since 2010 to a sharp fall in the 

term premium, but the expected short-term real rate component also moved down 

significantly.  Let’s consider each component more closely.  

The expected inflation component has drifted gradually downward for many years 

and has become quite stable.  In large part, the downward trend and stabilization of 

expected inflation in the United States are products of the increasing credibility of the 

Federal Reserve’s commitment to price stability.  In January 2012, the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) underscored this commitment by issuing a statement--since 

reaffirmed at its January 2013 meeting--on its longer-run goals and policy strategy, which 

included a longer-run inflation target of 2 percent.
3
  The anchoring of long-term inflation 

expectations near 2 percent has been a key factor influencing long-term interest rates over 

recent years.  It almost certainly helped mitigate the strong disinflationary pressures 

immediately following the crisis.  While I have not shown expected inflation for other 

advanced economies, the pictures would be very similar--again, except for Japan.  

With the expected inflation component of the 10-year rate near 2 percent and the 

rate itself a bit below 2 percent recently, it is clear that the combination of the other two 

components--the expected path of short-term real interest rates and the term premium--

must make a small net negative contribution. 

                                                                                                                                                 
this information, the model can be used to produce estimates of the components of nominal yields shown in 

chart 2.  Note that inflation in chart 2 is measured by the consumer price index; inflation measured by this 
index is close to but on average slightly higher than inflation as measured by the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures, the measure to which the Federal Open Market Committee’s 2 percent inflation 

objective refers. 
2
 For example, this decomposition as estimated based on expectations as reported in the Blue Chip 

Financial Forecasts gives broadly similar results, as do many standard term structure models.

 - 4 - 

The expected path of short-term real interest rates is, of course, influenced by 

monetary policy, both the current stance of policy and market participants’ expectations 

of how policy will evolve.  The stance of monetary policy at any given time, in turn, is 

driven largely by the economic outlook, the risks surrounding that outlook, and at times 

other factors, such as whether the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates is binding.  

In the current environment, both policymakers and market participants widely agree that 

supporting the U.S. economic recovery while keeping inflation close to 2 percent will 

likely require real short-term rates, currently negative, to remain low for some time.  As 

shown in chart 2, the expected average of the short-term real rate over the next 10 years 

has gradually declined to near zero over the past few years, in part reflecting downward 

revisions in expectations about the pace of the ongoing recovery and, hence, a pushing 

out of expectations regarding how long nominal short-term rates will remain low.
 4
  

As the persistence of the effects of the crisis have become clearer, the Federal 

Reserve’s communications have reinforced the expectation that conditions are likely to 

warrant highly accommodative policy for some time:  Most recently, the FOMC 

indicated that it expects to maintain an exceptionally low level of the federal funds rate at 

least as long as the unemployment rate is above 6.5 percent, projected inflation between 

one and two years ahead is no more than a half percentage point above the Committee’s 2 

percent target, and long-term inflation expectations remain stable.
5
 

In discussing the role of monetary policy in determining the expected future path 

of real short-term rates, I have cheated a little:  What monetary policy actually controls is 

                                                 
4
 Real interest rates are not constrained by the zero bound, and the fact that expected average real short-

term interest rates are near zero reflects that the nominal rate is expected, on average, to run close to the 

expected inflation rate, which is near 2 percent. 
5
 See the FOMC’s December statement at Board of Governors (2012). 


 - 5 - 

nominal short-term rates.  However, because inflation adjusts slowly, control of nominal 

short-term rates usually translates into control of real short-term rates over the short and 

medium term.  In the longer term, real interest rates are determined primarily by 

nonmonetary factors, such as the expected return to capital investments, which in turn is 

closely related to the underlying strength of the economy.  The fact that market yields 

currently incorporate an expectation of very low short-term real interest rates over the 

next 10 years suggests that market participants anticipate persistently slow growth and, 

consequently, low real returns to investment.  In other words, the low level of expected 

real short rates may reflect not only investor expectations for a slow cyclical recovery but 

also some downgrading of longer-term growth prospects.
6
 

Chart 3, which displays yields on inflation-indexed, long-term government bonds 

for the same five countries represented in chart 1, shows that expected real yields over the 

longer term are low in other advanced industrial economies as well.  Note again the 

strong similarity in returns across these economies, suggesting once again the importance 

of common global factors.  While indexed yields spiked up around the end of 2008, 

reflecting market stresses at the height of the crisis that undercut the demand for these 

bonds, these effects dissipated in 2009.  Since that time, inflation-indexed yields have 

declined steadily and now stand below zero in each country.
7
  Apparently, low longer-

term real rate expectations are playing an important role in accounting for low 10-year 

nominal rates in other industrial countries, as well as in the United States. 

                                                 
6
 Between April 2009 and October 2012, expectations for average growth over the next 10 years, as 

reported in Consensus Forecasts, have fallen about 0.2 percentage points for the United States.  This 

reduction in growth expectations is a broad phenomenon:  Between April 2009 and October 2012, the 

average prediction for growth over the next 10 years for Canada, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom 

has fallen between 0.1 and 0.6 percentage points. 
7
 It is important to note that these indexed yields are likely being pushed down by term premiums akin to 

the term premiums in nominal rates discussed in this speech. 


 - 6 - 

The third and final component of the long-term interest rate is the term premium, 

defined as the residual component not captured by expected real short-term rates or 

expected inflation.  As I noted, the largest portion of the downward move in long-term 

rates since 2010 appears to be due to a fall in the term premium, so it deserves some 

special discussion.   

In general, the term premium is the extra return investors expect to obtain from 

holding long-term bonds as opposed to holding and rolling over a sequence of short-term 

securities over the same period.  In part, the term premium compensates bondholders for 

interest rate risk--the risk of capital gains and losses that interest rate changes imply for 

the value of longer-term bonds.  Two changes in the nature of this interest rate risk have 

probably contributed to a general downward movement of the term premium in recent 

years.  First, the volatility of Treasury yields has declined, in part because short-term 

rates are pressed up against the zero lower bound and are expected to remain there for 

some time to come.  Second, the correlation of bond prices and stock prices has become 

increasingly negative over time, implying that bonds have become more valuable as a 

hedge against risks from holding other assets.
8
  

 Beyond interest rate risk, a number of other factors also affect the term premium 

in practice.  For example, during periods of financial turmoil, the prices of longer-term 

Treasury securities are often driven up by so-called safe-haven demands of investors who 

place special value on the safety and liquidity of Treasury securities.  Indeed, even during 

more placid periods, global demands for safe assets increase the value of Treasury 

securities.  Many foreign governments and central banks, particularly those with 

sustained current account surpluses, hold substantial international reserves in the form of 

                                                 
8
 See, for example, Campbell, Sunderam, and Viceira (2009).  


 - 7 - 

Treasuries.  Foreign holdings of U.S. Treasury securities currently amount to about 

$5-1/2 trillion, roughly half of the total amount of marketable Treasury debt outstanding.  

The global economic and financial stresses of recent years--triggered first by the financial 

crisis, and then by the problems in the euro area--appear to have significantly elevated the 

safe-haven demand for Treasury securities at times, pushing down Treasury yields and 

implying a lower, or even a negative, term premium.
9
   

Federal Reserve actions have also affected term premiums in recent years, most 

prominently through a series of Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programs.  These 

programs consist of open market purchases of agency debt, agency mortgage-backed 

securities, and longer-term Treasury securities.  To the extent that Treasury securities and 

agency-guaranteed securities are not perfect substitutes for other assets, Federal Reserve 

purchases of these assets should lower their term premiums, putting downward pressure 

on longer-term interest rates and easing financial conditions more broadly.  Although 

estimated effects vary, a growing body of research supports the view that LSAPs are 

effective at bringing down term premiums and thus reducing longer-term rates.
10

  Of 

course, the Federal Reserve has used this unconventional approach to lowering longer-

term rates because, with short-term rates near zero, it can no longer use its conventional 

approach of cutting the target for the federal funds rate.
11

  Accordingly, this portion of the 

                                                 
9
 There are some additional more technical features of the Treasury market that push down the term 

premium.  For example, the Treasury term premium is likely also depressed by the global demand for 

Treasury securities for use as collateral or margin in funding or derivatives markets.   
10

 See, for example, Gagnon, Raskin, Remache, and Sack (2011); Li and Wei (2012); Hamilton and Wu 

(2012); D’Amico, English, López-Salido, and Nelson (2012); Rosa (2012); Krishnamurthy and Vissing-

Jørgensen (2011); and Hancock and Passmore (2012). 
11

 Term premiums, calculated using similar methods, have also declined fairly sharply recently in Canada, 

Germany, and the United Kingdom; somewhat less so in Japan.  This result is notable in that the central 

banks of these economies, with the exception of the Bank of England, have not pursued large-scale 

purchases of longer-term securities. 


 - 8 - 

decline in the term premium might ultimately be attributed to the sluggish economic 

recovery, which prompted additional policy action from the Federal Reserve. 

Let’s recap.  Long-term interest rates are the sum of expected inflation, expected 

real short-term interest rates, and a term premium.  Expected inflation has been low and 

stable, reflecting central bank mandates and credibility as well as considerable resource 

slack in the major industrial economies.  Real interest rates are expected to remain low, 

reflecting the weakness of the recovery in advanced economies (and possibly some 

downgrading of longer-term growth prospects as well).  This weakness, all else being 

equal, dictates that monetary policy must remain accommodative if it is to support the 

recovery and reduce disinflationary risks.  Put another way, at the present time the major 

industrial economies apparently cannot sustain significantly higher real rates of return; in 

that respect, central banks--so long as they are meeting their price stability mandates--

have little choice but to take actions that keep nominal long-term rates relatively low, as 

suggested by the similarity in the levels of the rates shown in chart 1.  Finally, term 

premiums are low or negative, reflecting a host of factors, including central bank actions 

in support of economic recovery.  Thus, while the current constellation of long-term rates 

across many advanced countries has few precedents, it is not puzzling:  It follows 

naturally from the economic circumstances of these countries and the implications of 

these circumstances for the policies of their central banks. 

How Are Long-Term Rates Likely to Evolve? 

So, how are long-term rates likely to evolve over coming years?  It is worth 

pausing to note that, not that long ago, central bankers would have carefully avoided this 

topic.  However, it is now a bedrock principle of central banking that transparency about 


 - 9 - 

the likely path of policy, in general, and interest rates, in particular, can increase the 

effectiveness of policy.  In the present context, I would add that transparency may 

mitigate risks emanating from unexpected rate movements.  Thus, let me turn to 

prospects for long-term rates, starting with the expected path of rates and then turning to 

deviations from the expected path that may arise. 

If, as the FOMC anticipates, the economic recovery continues at a moderate pace, 

with unemployment slowly declining and inflation expectations remaining near 2 percent, 

then long-term interest rates would be expected to rise gradually toward more normal 

levels over the next several years.  This rise would occur as the market’s view of the 

expected date at which the Federal Reserve will begin the removal of policy 

accommodation draws nearer and then as accommodation is removed.  Some 

normalization of the term premium might also contribute to a rise in long-term rates.  

To illustrate possible paths, chart 4 displays four different forecasts of the 

evolution of the 10-year Treasury yield over coming years.  The black line is the forecast 

reported in the December 2012 Blue Chip Financial Forecasts survey.  The green line 

gives the Congressional Budget Office forecast published in February, and the blue line 

presents the median from the Survey of Professional Forecasters, as reported in the first 

quarter of this year.  Finally, the purple line shows a forecast based on the term structure 

model used for the decomposition of the 10-year yield in chart 2.
12

  While these forecasts 

embody a wide range of underlying models and assumptions, the basic message is clear--

long-term interest rates are expected to rise gradually over the next few years, rising (at 

                                                 
12

 This projection assumes that two key components of the 10-year Treasury yield shown in chart 2--the 

expected average real short-rate and the term premium--revert to their respective mean levels over the 

period 2000 to 2006 during the next 5 years; the expected average inflation component is assumed to 

remain constant near the 2 percent level prevailing at the end of 2012.  


 - 10 - 

least according to these forecasts) to around 3 percent at the end of 2014.  The forecasts 

in chart 4 imply a total increase of between 200 and 300 basis points in long-term yields 

between now and 2017.  

Of course, the forecasts in chart 4 are just forecasts, and reality might well turn 

out to be different.  Chart 5 provides three complementary approaches to summarizing 

the uncertainty surrounding forecasts of long-term rates.  The dark gray bars in the chart 

are based on the range of forecasts reported in the Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, the blue 

bars are based on the historical uncertainty regarding long-term interest rates as reflected 

in the Board staff’s FRB/US model of the U.S. economy, and the orange bars give a 

market-based measure of uncertainty derived from swaptions.  These three different 

measures give a broadly similar picture about the upside and downside risks to the 

forecasts of long-term rates.  Rates 100 basis points higher than the expected paths in 

chart 4 by 2014 are certainly plausible outcomes as judged by each of the three measures, 

and this uncertainty grows to as much as 175 basis points by 2017.  Note, though, that 

while the risk of an unexpected rise in interest rates has drawn much attention, the level 

of long-term interest rates also could prove to be lower than forecast.  Indeed, by the 

measures shown in chart 5, the upside and downside risks to the level of rates are roughly 

symmetric as of 2017.  

We also have some historical experience with increases in rates during tightening 

cycles to consider.  For example, in 1994, 10-year Treasury yields rose about 220 basis 

points over the course of a year, reflecting an unexpected quickening in the pace of 

economic growth and signs of building inflation pressures.  This increase in long-term 

rates appears to have reflected a mix of a pronounced rise in the expected path of the 


 - 11 - 

policy interest rate and some increase in the term premium.
13

  A rise of more than 200 

basis points in a year is at the upper end of what is implied by the mean paths and 

uncertainty measures shown in charts 4 and 5, but these measures still admit a substantial 

probability of higher--and lower--paths. 

Overall, then, we anticipate that long-term rates will rise as the recovery 

progresses and expected short-term real rates and term premiums return to more normal 

levels.  The precise timing and pace of the increase will depend importantly on how 

economic conditions develop, however, and is subject to considerable two-sided 

uncertainty.  

Managing Risks Associated with the Future Course of Long-Term Interest Rates 

As I noted when I began my remarks, one reason to focus on the timing and pace 

of a possible increase in long-term rates is that these outcomes may have implications for 

financial stability.  Commentators have raised two broad concerns surrounding the 

outlook for long-term rates.  To oversimplify, the first risk is that rates will remain low, 

and the second is that they will not.  In particular, in an environment of persistently low 

returns, incentives may grow for some investors to engage in an unsafe “reach for yield” 

either through excessive use of leverage or through other forms of risk-taking.  My Board 

colleague Jeremy Stein recently discussed how this behavior may arise in some financial 

markets, including credit markets.
14

  Alternatively, we face a risk that longer-term rates 

will rise sharply at some point, imposing capital losses on holders of fixed-income 

                                                 
13

 The two components were intertwined, as measures of uncertainty about the path of policy moved up 

sharply, likely contributing to a rise in term premiums.  Notably, in this episode, the rise in rates created 

some stress in financial markets but did not lead to serious financial instability, nor did it significantly 

impair economic activity.  However, one would not want to conclude from that one case that sharp rises in 

rates do not pose risks. 
14

 See Stein (2013).

instruments, including financial institutions.  Of course, the two risks may very well be 

mutually reinforcing:  Taking on duration risk is one way investors may reach for yield, 

and the losses resulting from a sharp rise in longer-term rates will be greater if investors 

have done so.
15


One might argue that the right response to these risks is to tighten monetary 

policy, raising long-term interest rates with the aim of forestalling any undesirable 

buildup of risk.  I hope my discussion this evening has convinced you that, at least in 

economic circumstances of the sort that prevail today, such an approach could be quite 

costly and might well be counterproductive from the standpoint of promoting financial 

stability.  Long-term interest rates in the major industrial countries are low for good 

reason:  Inflation is low and stable and, given expectations of weak growth, expected real 

short rates are low.  Premature rate increases would carry a high risk of short-circuiting 

the recovery, possibly leading--ironically enough--to an even longer period of low long-

term rates.  Only a strong economy can deliver persistently high real returns to savers and 

investors, and the economies of the major industrial countries are still in the recovery 

phase. 

So how can financial stability concerns--which the Federal Reserve takes very 

seriously--be addressed?  Our strategy, undertaken in cooperation with other regulators 

and central banks, has a number of elements.  

                                                 
15

 On the other hand, some risk-taking--such as when an entrepreneur takes out a loan to start a new 

business or an existing firm expands capacity--is a necessary element of a healthy economic recovery.  

Moreover, although accommodative monetary policies may increase certain types of risk-taking, in the 

present circumstances they also serve in some ways to reduce risk in the system, most importantly by 

strengthening the overall economy, but also by encouraging firms to rely more on longer-term funding, and 

by reducing debt service costs for households and businesses. 


 - 13 - 

First, we have greatly increased our macroprudential oversight, with a particular 

focus on potential systemic vulnerabilities, including buildups of leverage and unstable 

funding patterns as well as interest rate risk.
16

  Under the umbrella of our 

interdisciplinary Large Institutions Supervision Coordinating Committee, we pay special 

attention to developments at the largest, most complex financial firms, making use of 

information gathered in our supervision of the institutions and drawn from financial 

market indicators of their health and systemic vulnerability.  We also monitor the shadow 

banking sector, especially its interaction with regulated institutions; in this work, we look 

for factors that may leave the system vulnerable to an adverse “fire sale” dynamic, in 

which declining asset values could force leveraged investors to sell assets, depressing 

prices further.  We exchange information regularly with other regulatory agencies, both 

directly and under the auspices of the Financial Stability Oversight Council.  Throughout 

the Federal Reserve System, work in these areas is conducted by experts in banking, 

financial markets, monetary policy, and other disciplines, and at the Federal Reserve 

Board we have established our Office for Financial Stability Policy and Research to help 

coordinate this work.  Findings are presented regularly to the Board and to the FOMC for 

use in its monetary policy deliberations. 

Second, recognizing that our monitoring of the financial sector will always be 

imperfect, we are using regulatory and supervisory tools to help ensure that financial 

institutions are sufficiently resilient to weather losses and periods of market turmoil 

arising from any source.  Indeed, reflecting expectations embodied in the new Basel III 

and Dodd-Frank standards, the largest and most complex financial firms have 

substantially increased both their capital and their liquidity in recent years.  Our current

 - 14 - 

round of stress testing of the largest bank holding companies, to be completed early this 

month, examines whether the largest banking firms have sufficient capital to come 

through a seriously adverse economic downturn and still have the capacity to perform 

their roles as providers of credit.  In a related exercise, we are also asking banks to stress-

test the adequacy of their capital in the face of a hypothetical sharp upward shift in the 

term structure of interest rates. 

Third, our approach to communicating and implementing monetary policy 

provides the Federal Reserve with new tools that could potentially be used to mitigate the 

risk of sharp increases in interest rates.  In 1994--the period discussed earlier in which 

sharp increases in interest rates strained financial markets--the FOMC’s communication 

tools were very limited; indeed, it had just begun issuing public statements following 

policy moves.  By contrast, in recent years, the Federal Reserve has provided a great deal 

of additional information about its expectations for the path of the economy and the 

stance of monetary policy.  Most recently, as I mentioned, the FOMC announced 

unemployment and inflation thresholds characterizing conditions that will guide the 

timing of the first increase in the target for the federal funds rate.  Further, the FOMC 

stated that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is likely to remain 

appropriate for a considerable time after our current asset purchase program ends.  By 

providing greater clarity concerning the likely course of the federal funds rate, FOMC 

communication should both make policy more effective and reduce the risk that market 

misperceptions of the Committee’s intentions would lead to unnecessary interest rate 

volatility.   


 - 15 - 

In addition, the Federal Reserve could, if necessary, use its balance sheet tools to 

mitigate the risk of a sharp rise in rates.  For example, the Committee has indicated its 

intention to sell its agency securities gradually once conditions warrant.  The Committee 

also noted, however, that the pace of sales could be adjusted up or down in response to 

material changes in either the economic outlook or financial conditions.  In particular, 

adjustments to the pace or timing of asset sales could be used, under some circumstances, 

to dampen excessively sharp adjustments in longer-term interest rates. 

Conclusion 

Let me finish with some thoughts on balancing the risks we face in the current 

challenging economic environment, at a time when our main policy tool, the federal 

funds rate, is near its effective lower bound.  On the one hand, the Fed’s dual mandate 

has led us to provide strong support for the recovery, both to promote maximum 

employment and to keep inflation from falling below our price stability objective.  One 

purpose of this support is to prompt a return to the productive risk-taking that is essential 

to robust growth and to getting the unemployed back to work.  On the other hand, we 

must be mindful of the possibility that sustained periods of low interest rates and highly 

accommodative policy could lead to excessive risk-taking in some financial markets.  

The balance here is not an easy one to strike.  While the recent crisis is vivid testament to 

the costs of ill-judged risk-taking, we must also be aware of constraints posed by the 

present state of the economy.  In light of the moderate pace of the recovery and the 

continued high level of economic slack, dialing back accommodation with the goal of 

deterring excessive risk-taking in some areas poses its own risks to growth, price 

stability, and, ultimately, financial stability.  Indeed, as I noted, a premature removal of

objectives of price stability and maximum employment; and we will, of course, remain 

prepared to use all of our tools as needed to address any such developments.
