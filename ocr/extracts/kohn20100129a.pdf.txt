 I very much appreciate Chairman Bair’s invitation to participate in this symposium.  

Interest rate risk management is an especially important topic in light of current market realities.  

Following its meeting earlier this week, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) repeated 

its expectation that rates would remain at exceptionally low levels for an extended period.  I will 

say little about the outlook for interest rates, particularly just a few days after an FOMC meeting, 

but it is obvious that as the economic recovery gains traction, it will be appropriate at some point 

for the FOMC to raise rates.  One of my messages today is that the response of interest rates 

across the maturity spectrum to an actual or expected tightening of monetary policy is always 

hard to predict, but is especially so in current circumstances.  The usual uncertainty about 

changes in policy interest rates is compounded by uncertainties related to the possible special 

effects of the historically low level of interest rates in the current recession, as well as the 

unprecedented increases in the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet and bank reserves as a 

result of our credit programs and large-scale asset purchases.  This run-up in Federal Reserve 

assets and bank reserves will also need to be unwound over time, with possible consequences for 

the structure of interest rates.1   

 Another message I hope to convey today is that many banks, thrifts, and credit unions 

may be exposed to an eventual increase in short-term interest rates.  As the interest rate risk 

advisory issued by each of the financial regulators earlier this month recognized, interest rate risk 

is inherent in the business of banking.  But it is especially important now for institutions to have 

in place sound practices to measure, monitor, and control this risk.  They must not become 

distracted from this critical task by their efforts to deal with credit problems, nor can they think 

that assuming greater interest rate risk is a sound strategy for compensating for the losses they

are taking on their loan portfolios.  The recent crisis has been a stark reminder that borrowing 

short and lending long is an inherently risky business strategy.  As the financial markets became 

disrupted, the liquidity risks of this strategy became painfully evident.  Intermediaries need to be 

sure that as the economy recovers, they aren’t also hit by the interest rate risk that often 

accompanies this sort of mismatch in asset and liability maturities.      

Interest Rate Movements   

 Interest rates are difficult to forecast in the most settled or normal of times, and their path 

is especially uncertain in the current circumstances.  Short-term rates will rise at some point, but 

when, how quickly, and by how much will depend on the outlook for economic activity and 

inflation as the Federal Reserve pursues its objectives of maximum employment and stable 

prices.  The historical record shows that short-term rates have moved in a variety of patterns in 

economic recoveries from recession:  Sometimes rates began to rise shortly after the economy 

turned around; at other times it took a while for policy tightening to begin; and in other instances, 

rates continued to decline even after the economic recovery took hold, as during the 1991-92 

period and, to a much lesser extent, during the 2002-03 period.  We are now just beginning to 

recover from the deepest recession since World War II.  Most economists expect only moderate 

growth and a slow decline in the unemployment rate over the next few years, importantly 

because it will take time for banks to rebuild their capital and begin competing more vigorously 

for loan business again.  Clearly, we are in uncharted waters for monetary policy and the 

financial markets.   

 When the Federal Reserve begins to raise short-term rates, the yield curve usually 

flattens--but not always.  Longer-term rates can respond in a multitude of ways, with important 

implications for financial intermediaries.  Recall that in 1994, long-term rates actually rose more 

than short-term rates for a time, steepening the yield curve and imposing substantial capital

losses on market participants exposed to rising bond yields.  By contrast, in the second half of 

2004, long-term rates hardly rose, and in 2005 they actually declined when the Federal Reserve 

tightened monetary policy.  In my view, the decline in long-term rates partly reflected a strong 

demand for dollar-denominated assets, especially from countries running current account 

surpluses, which were, in effect, greatly adding to the global pool of savings seeking higher 

returns.  Extremely low interest rate volatility probably also contributed to investors’ willingness 

to extend duration.  No one knows what will happen to long-term rates over coming years, but 

the Group of 20 leaders have focused on emerging from this recession with better-balanced 

global growth, which suggests that foreign capital could be less plentiful for the United States.  

And volatilities are unlikely to return to their previous quiescent state.  Banks and other investors 

cannot count on a repeat of the most recent experience--the absence of capital losses when short-

term rates rise.   

 In addition, the behavior of intermediate- and longer-term interest rates over coming 

years could well be influenced by a number of unusual elements in the current circumstances.  

Short-term rates have been close to zero for a year and, if the economy follows the trajectory 

expected by the Federal Reserve, are likely to stay there for an “extended period.”  One of the 

purposes of those very low short-term rates is to induce investors to buy longer-term and riskier 

assets than they were buying over the past year, thus reducing borrowing costs for households 

and businesses.  How people will react to increases in expected, and then actual, short-term 

interest rates after such a period is hard to tell.  Moreover, to counter the financial forces 

weighing on the economy, the Federal Reserve purchased large quantities of long-term agency, 

agency mortgage-backed, and Treasury securities, putting significant downward pressure on 

longer-term interest rates.  We are now winding down those purchases.  The effects on rates of 

the cessation of our purchases are likely to be modest, but that judgment is subject to 


- 4 - 
 

considerable uncertainty.  Moreover, the purchases created a large volume of excess reserves in 

the banking system.  The reserves themselves could begin to affect the pattern of interest rates if 

depositories try to diversify out of reserves into other assets.  When it comes time to absorb those 

reserves and raise interest rates, the Federal Reserve has a variety of tools at its disposal, ranging 

from increasing the rate it pays on excess reserves, to absorbing reserves by engaging in reverse 

repurchase agreements or offering term deposits to depository institutions, to selling the assets on 

its balance sheet.  The possible mix of and sequencing in the use of those tools is under active 

consideration by the FOMC.  We will choose the combination best suited to meeting our 

macroeconomic objectives, and those choices will influence not only the general level of interest 

rates, but also the relationships among them.    

Finally, intermediate- and longer-term interest rates fluctuate in response to many forces 

in addition to changes in the stance of monetary policy; yield curves have shifted considerably at 

times in the past when monetary policy has been relatively inactive.  For example, the path of the 

federal budget deficit is likely to be an important influence over coming years.  As you know, 

under current law, the deficit is on track to remain quite large even as the economy recovers, 

pushing up the ratio of federal debt to gross domestic product substantially.  Unless the trajectory 

is changed, the competition for savings between the government, on the one hand, and 

households and businesses, on the other, could be significant as households and businesses begin 

to borrow and spend in the recovery, putting upward pressure on interest rates.  Moreover, a 

number of institutions have an unusually large amount of debt to roll over in the next few years 

as a consequence of the shortening of the maturity of borrowing that naturally occurred under the 

pressure of financial market turmoil.  I’m confident that sound institutions will find credit readily 

available to them, but the cost could be affected by the increasing competition for funds.

Interest Rate Movements and the Performance of Financial Intermediaries  

In light of the uncertain course of interest rates, financial intermediaries face significant 

challenges in managing their interest rate exposures.  Clearly, the impact of changes in market 

rates depends on the maturity and re-pricing mismatches embedded in institutions’ assets, 

liabilities, and off-balance-sheet positions.  In general, those institutions whose assets are 

expected to re-price faster than their liabilities--referred to as “asset-sensitive”--would be 

expected to benefit from a rise in rates, because higher rates, holding everything else constant, 

should increase their net interest margins.  Conversely, the net interest margins of “liability-

sensitive” institutions--those whose asset durations are longer than their liability durations--

would be expected to be negatively affected by a rise in market interest rates.  

Of course, there are more than 15,000 U.S. banks, thrifts, and credit unions, and the 

interest rate risk exposures faced by individual institutions are much more complex than these 

simple characterizations might lead us to believe.  Each institution has its own unique funding 

structure and asset-liability re-pricing mismatches, based not only on the structural 

characteristics of its particular market and product offerings, but also on the impact of the current 

crisis and government countermeasures on its credit and liquidity risk exposures.    

For example, many large banking organizations have publicly disclosed that they have 

asset-sensitive positions, suggesting an ability to benefit from increases in short-term rates.  Such 

characteristics are no doubt influenced by their significant holdings of excess reserves and other 

short-term liquid assets taken on during the crisis.  Monetary policy tightening will entail 

draining excess reserves at some point, and as institutions reconsider their liquidity 

management--subject to new, stronger liquidity requirements from supervisors, to be sure--their 

current asset-sensitivity might be expected to decline.  And the behavior of various types of 

customers and instruments may be difficult to predict as the economy and financial markets 


- 6 - 
 

emerge from this highly unusual period.  Thus, even larger asset-sensitive institutions may need 

to deal with more complex and difficult interest rate risk issues than might be thought.  

On the liability side of the balance sheet, banks and other depositories may be facing 

unusual uncertainties about the future behavior of non-interest-bearing and low-interest deposits.  

As you are well aware, these types of deposits help boost the net interest income of depository 

institutions.  A number of institutions, both large and small, posted increases in such deposits 

over the past two years as a result of a “flight to quality” by consumers and small businesses 

from less-sound intermediaries, money market funds, and other short-term investments.  

Moreover, banks themselves, aided by the expansion of deposit insurance, have competed 

heavily for such deposits as potentially more stable sources of funds in a crisis environment.  

Importantly, such newly acquired low-cost “core” deposits may not be as stable or as interest rate 

insensitive as similar deposits may have been in the past.  Without a doubt, consumers and small 

businesses are eager to raise their returns on short-term deposits, and institutions may have to 

compete even more strongly for such deposits once short-term rates begin to move higher.  

Forecasting the behavior of depositors and the business strategies of other intermediaries has 

always been a challenge for depository institutions and will be even more challenging as we exit 

from the current policy and interest rate environment.          

These challenges would seem even greater for liability-sensitive institutions--and a 

significant number of community banks appear to fall into that category.  As competition for 

low-cost deposits has increased, many community banks have been forced to increase their 

reliance on wholesale funds, including brokered deposits, which are significantly more interest 

rate sensitive and less stable than traditional core deposits.  

At the same time, many community banks--in competition with securitization markets 

and larger institutions for consumer and small business loans--face challenges in acquiring good-


- 7 - 
 

quality short- and intermediate-duration assets to match their shorter-term liabilities.  Many 

community banks have increased their holdings of longer-term mortgage assets, including 

mortgage securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae and the government-sponsored enterprises, in an 

effort to enhance both credit quality and earning asset yields.  While such holdings advance 

public policy interests in reviving the mortgage market, they nevertheless pose the potential for 

increasing interest rate risk exposures, in part because of the embedded options in residential 

mortgages.  

Additionally, some banks appear to be assuming more-complex exposures to interest rate 

risk through purchases of structured products.  The recent crisis has focused attention on the 

problems and complexity of structured products in the form of collateralized debt obligations, 

which carved up the credit risk of underlying assets into various tranches--a product that, it 

turned out, too few investors understood.  But similar lessons were learned with regard to interest 

rate risk management in the early 1990s when many institutions purchased various types of 

structured collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) with embedded interest-rate options that 

were not fully understood--and then incurred substantial and unexpected losses when interest 

rates rose in 1994.  Many CMOs turned out to have durations that fluctuated sharply in response 

to even small changes in market rates, resulting in significant declines in the value of the 

instruments and in many cases increasing the asset-liability mismatches they were intended to 

mitigate.  Capital losses as longer-term interest rates rise are a risk facing even asset-sensitive 

banks.  As bankers prepare to meet the uncertainties that lie ahead, they must not forget these 

hard-learned lessons and must make sure they fully understand how the securities they purchase 

will perform in different economic and financial market environments, including an environment 

of rising short- and long-term interest rates.

Importance of Robust Interest Rate Risk Management at All Banking Organizations  

Because of the potential complexity of interest rate risk exposures at individual 

institutions, supervisors have, for many years, pointed out the need for bankers to use sound 

practices for managing these exposures.  Employing sound practices becomes even more critical 

in light of the current uncertainties surrounding the timing and impacts of changes in interest 

rates.  It was concern about the risks to banks from interest rate changes that led the supervisors 

to issue the recent advisory on interest rate risk management.  That advisory reminded 

institutions of guidance dating back to mid-1990s.  Other speakers at this symposium will no 

doubt summarize and expand upon the guidance discussed in that advisory, but the key 

principles of risk management apply to interest rate risk, as they do to the management of other 

risks.  These principles articulate the need for (1) appropriate corporate governance, including 

actively engaged boards of directors and senior managers; (2) adequate policies, procedures, and 

limits to guide the institution’s interest rate risk management process; (3) robust interest rate risk 

measurement and reporting systems that focus heavily on stress testing of both alternative 

interest rate scenarios and the effect of key behavioral assumptions on the results of such tests; 

and (4) strong internal controls structured to ensure the integrity of all elements of the interest 

rate risk management process.  

As the recent crisis has emphasized, senior managers must actively engage in the 

measurement and assessment of risk exposures.  Given today’s technology, even some small 

banks are using reasonably sophisticated measurement techniques to assess the impact of 

different interest rate scenarios on the different types of interest rate risk that these institutions 

are exposed to.  These risks include basic re-pricing mismatches that are most sensitive to 

changes in the level of rates; exposures to different yield curve shifts, twists, and slopes; basis 

risks, which arise from re-pricing differences in instruments with similar maturities; and the risks 


- 9 - 
 

that both explicit and embedded interest rate options can pose to the performance and safety and 

soundness of an institution.   

Clearly, every financial institution, regardless of size, must understand the risks it is 

taking, and how to control and mitigate those risks.  We have seen too well and too painfully in 

the past several years, in the largest banks and in the smallest, what happens when systems and 

management understanding are not commensurate with the risks being taken.  The consequences 

fall not only on bank owners, staff, and customers, but potentially on the entire economy.  We 

cannot allow that experience to be repeated, and this conference is one step in making sure that 

interest rate risk does not undermine the safety and soundness of our nation’s most important 

lenders--banks, thrifts, and credit unions.
