July 20, 2012 







It is a pleasure to participate in this commemorative conference on the occasion of 

the 60th anniversary of the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies (CEMLA).  

Since its establishment in 1952, CEMLA has achieved a great deal on both the policy and 

research fronts to promote our understanding of monetary and banking issues in Latin 

America and the Caribbean.     

The topic I have been asked to speak about today, “Central Bank Cooperation in 

Times of Crisis,” is very important.  As we know, central banks typically work 

individually to achieve objectives for their domestic economies.  In the case of the 

Federal Reserve, monetary policy is conducted to achieve our statutory objectives of 

maximum employment and price stability.  And, of course, fostering a stable financial 

system is key to attaining these goals.  But the experience of the past few years has 

illustrated--first with the global financial crisis and more recently with the strains in 

Europe--that cooperation and coordination among central banks around the world may be 

necessary at critical junctures to achieve these domestic objectives.    

In my remarks today, I will describe the evolution of the Federal Reserve’s 

policies during and after the global recession and show how many of those policies were 

undertaken in coordination with, or in parallel to, similar actions by other central banks.  I 

will start with the monetary policy responses of the Federal Reserve and other central 

banks during the financial crisis.  I will then discuss the efforts that the Federal Reserve 

has made, often in cooperation with other central banks and international partners, to help 

enhance financial stability.  Finally, I will focus on the challenges facing Latin American

central banks, whose economies and financial systems were affected by the crisis itself, 

and by the responses of other central banks to the crisis.1   

Federal Reserve Policies and Coordination with Other Central Banks  

 Although the financial crisis that emerged in the summer of 2007 initially 

manifested itself as a sharp deterioration in U.S. mortgage markets, the roots of the 

problem ran deeper.  Indeed, the consequences of a credit boom combined with excessive 

leverage, mispricing of risk, and deficiencies in risk management became increasingly 

apparent.  And given the international extent of these vulnerabilities and 

interconnections, the crisis quickly became global.  Central banks around the world 

responded forcefully.    

From the outset, the Federal Reserve vigorously used its traditional toolkit for 

managing short-term interest rates.  The Federal Reserve reduced the target federal funds 

rate from 5-1/4 percent in August 2007 to a range of 0 to ¼ percent by the end of 2008.  

International coordination on policy rate decisions is rare, but in October 2008, the 

Federal Reserve announced a reduction in its policy rate jointly with five other major 

central banks:  the Bank of Canada, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the 

Swedish Riksbank, and the Swiss National Bank.  With clear signs of simultaneous 

economic slowing in many countries, this coordinated action sent a strong positive signal 

to financial markets about policymakers’ collective intent to mitigate the effects of the 

crisis on their economies.  Although not through directly coordinated actions, other 

central banks, including those in Latin America, were also reducing policy rates.

 The stresses in financial markets and liquidity shortages were severe.  So, in 

addition to cutting policy rates, the Federal Reserve took measures designed to provide 

liquidity first to banks and later to other financial institutions.  A third set of measures 

involved the provision of liquidity to address pressures in commercial paper markets and 

at money market funds.  These liquidity programs were largely unwound when financial 

markets improved.   

 As the Federal Reserve and other central banks worked to address liquidity 

shortages in their own markets, it became clear that, as a result of globalization, firms 

were experiencing funding shortages not only in domestic currencies, but in foreign 

currencies as well.  In particular, dollar funding shortages appeared not just in the United 

States but in countries around the world, which, in turn, exacerbated pressures in U.S. 

funding markets.  The Federal Reserve already was providing liquidity to foreign 

financial firms operating in the United States through its discount window and other 

facilities.  To further address pressures in dollar funding markets and support the flow of 

credit to U.S. families and businesses, the Federal Reserve ultimately approved bilateral 

currency swap arrangements with 14 foreign central banks, including two Latin American 

central banks.2  Under these swap arrangements, in exchange for their own currencies, 

foreign central banks obtained dollars from the Federal Reserve to lend to financial 

institutions in their jurisdictions.  These swap arrangements pose essentially no risk to the 

Federal Reserve:  They are unwound (with a fee paid by the central bank drawing on the 

swap arrangement to the Federal Reserve) at the exact same exchange rate that applied to 

the original transaction, they are conducted with major central banks with track records of

Japan, New Zealand, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

prudent decisionmaking, and they are secured by the foreign currency provided by those 

central banks.    

The success of these swap lines in alleviating funding pressures and reducing 

interbank borrowing rates is a testament to the benefits of central bank cooperation.  

Moreover, in addition to easing funding shortages, these swaps also helped to allay 

market fears--they had a preventive as well as a curative role.  For example, four of the 

central banks that participated in these arrangements--Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, and 

Singapore--did not end up drawing on the facilities, but it is generally believed that the 

existence of the lines helped prevent stresses that could have otherwise developed.  As 

the financial crisis receded, the swap lines were closed in February 2010.  However, swap 

lines with several foreign central banks were reopened in response to financial strains that 

developed in Europe.3 

 In many countries, policy rates fell to nearly zero.  With substantial economic 

slack remaining, these central banks faced the challenge of finding ways to further ease 

monetary policy.  The Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet through the purchase 

of longer-term Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities.  

The idea was to put downward pressure on longer-term yields to spur demand and also to 

encourage some portfolio rebalancing toward riskier assets and loans to the private 

sector.  More recently, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to extend the 

average maturity of its holdings of securities by selling shorter-maturity Treasury 

securities and buying longer-maturity Treasury securities.  This maturity extension

through February 2013.

program created additional downward pressure on long-term rates without expanding the 

size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet.  

In addition to using conventional monetary policy and balance sheet tools to 

provide monetary accommodation, communication is an important tool used by central 

banks to enhance the effectiveness of policy.  At the conclusion of each meeting, the 

Federal Open Market Committee issues a statement of policy actions taken and the 

rationale for those actions.  Detailed minutes are published three weeks later, and lightly 

edited transcripts are made public with a five-year lag.  In 2011, the Chairman began 

holding press conferences on a roughly quarterly basis to discuss economic projections 

submitted by participants and actions taken at the meeting.  In August 2011, the 

Committee statement included forward guidance that economic conditions are likely to 

warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013--a 

date that was later extended to late 2014--which put further downward pressure on 

longer-term interest rates.  In January 2012, the Committee released a statement of its 

longer-run goals and policy strategy.  At that same meeting, the Committee also began 

including participant projections of the appropriate path of the federal funds rate in the 

Summary of Economic Projections.  The Committee continues to discuss ways in which 

communication can be used to enhance policy.   

While these policy moves of the Federal Reserve were not coordinated with other 

central banks, other central banks shared these challenges and responded in broadly 

similar ways to expand their balance sheets.  For example, the Bank of England and the 

Bank of Japan also used large-scale purchases of medium- and long-term government 

securities to provide stimulus.  In addition, several other foreign central banks, including 




- 6 -

the Bank of Canada and the Bank of Japan, also more actively used forward guidance 

about the path of policy rates.   

Finally, the common challenges and problems of the past few years reinforced the 

importance of open discussion among the world’s central banks.  Central bank leaders 

draw on collective experience through discussion in such diverse international forums as 

the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), Group of Twenty (G-20), and CEMLA.  

CEMLA is an excellent example of what can be achieved by central bank cooperation 

through such means as courses and seminars, international meetings, technical assistance, 

publication of research studies, and exchange programs.   

Cooperation in Areas of Supervision and Regulation 
   
 Central banks around the globe have focused not just on responding to the crisis, 

but also on working to minimize the risk of future crises by improving the soundness and 

stability of the financial sector.  Indeed, the global financial crisis has underscored the 

importance of the financial stability objective of central banks.  Given the global nature 

of financial markets and large financial institutions, coordination and cooperation among 

central banks and bank supervisors and regulators more generally is crucial in achieving 

this goal.  Let me provide a few examples of such efforts.   

First, the crisis highlighted shortcomings in capital and liquidity requirements.  

Central banks with bank supervisory responsibilities have been heavily involved in 

designing and promoting international frameworks to address these shortcomings.  The 

Federal Reserve has supported the Basel Committee’s adoption of improved capital 

requirements that include raising risk-weightings for traded assets, improving the quality 

of loss-absorbing capital through a new minimum common equity ratio standard, creating 




- 7 -

a capital conservation buffer, and introducing an international leverage ratio requirement.  

The Federal Reserve has also supported the Basel Committee’s work on quantitative 

liquidity requirements and its work on capital surcharges for banks of global systemic 

importance.  

 Another example of international cooperation on the regulatory front is the 

Financial Stability Board (FSB), which consists of key financial regulators around the 

world, including the Federal Reserve.  The FSB has identified a number of challenges 

that international cooperation among central banks and financial regulators are helping to 

address.  One such challenge regards over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.  To reduce the 

systemic risk of OTC derivatives, the G-20 leaders have agreed to require that 

standardized OTC derivatives be cleared through a central counterparty.  Another 

challenge is that of cross-border resolutions, and the FSB has undertaken analytic work 

on how to improve the resolvability of financial firms that have a substantial international 

presence.  The FSB has also identified and spurred cooperative work on gaps in financial 

data and on the so-called shadow banking system.  

 As a bank supervisor, the Federal Reserve has cooperated with foreign bank 

supervisors (including other central banks) through participation in supervisory colleges, 

which are multilateral standing working groups of supervisors formed for the purpose of 

enhancing effective consolidated supervision of an international banking organization.  

Supervisory colleges enhance the information exchange and cooperation of home and 

host supervisors to help them develop a better understanding of the risk profile of a 

banking organization.

 Lastly, at the Federal Reserve we have also been working closely with other U.S. 

agencies in the recently established Financial Stability Oversight Council on the 

implementation of the financial stability reforms laid out in the Dodd-Frank Act.  One 

key aspect of this act is the focus on a “macroprudential approach” that pays attention to 

the financial system as a whole, in addition to individual financial institutions and 

markets.  The greater emphasis on macroprudential tools has been widespread.  Indeed, 

the Federal Reserve has participated in analyses of macroprudential tools and policies 

undertaken with other G-20 central banks at the BIS and with bank supervisors on the 

Basel Committee.     

One of the reasons that coordination is required for supervision and regulation is 

the substantial cross-border operations of many financial firms.  The deleveraging of 

some global financial institutions with a significant presence in Latin America and the 

potential effect on economic performance serves as a stark reminder of the interlinkages 

of financial institutions and economies.  The deleveraging of these institutions also 

highlights the need to coordinate across regulators and acts as a catalyst to spur greater 

action and information sharing. 

Latin American Central Banks:  Crisis Response and Challenges  
 

Earlier I mentioned how central banks around the world, including those in Latin 

America, lowered policy rates in response to the global financial crisis.  Although the 

crisis developed in advanced economies, Latin American central banks, such as those in 

Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, cut policy rates in 2009 as their economies were 

being hit hard through trade and financial linkages with advanced economies as well as 

through commodity price channels.  Their capacity to follow countercyclical policies was 




- 9 -

in striking contrast to many previous times of stress, when policy rates could not be 

lowered for fear of frightening off international investors.  The fact that these Latin 

American economies were able to respond by lowering policy rates and also by boosting 

fiscal support is a testament to the decisive steps taken to strengthen macroeconomic 

policies and financial systems, including improvements in the monetary frameworks 

under which their central banks operate.   

Many Latin American economies staged quick and strong recoveries from the 

global recession and subsequently started to raise policy rates to try to ward off 

overheating pressures.  Conversely, many advanced economies, with their prolonged soft 

recoveries, needed to continue to follow expansionary monetary policies.  Accordingly, 

as was also the case in emerging Asia, the monetary policy stance of several central 

banks in Latin America, such as Brazil and Chile, diverged from those of advanced 

economies.  The resulting rise in interest rate differentials, on top of the generally 

stronger growth in Latin America, helped to fuel capital inflows, which, at times, have 

proved challenging for the policymakers of these economies to manage.  Of course, more 

recently, with intensification of the crisis in Europe, some Latin American countries, 

most notably Brazil, have again lowered their policy rates in response to concerns about 

slowing growth.    

Even within Latin America, however, the experience of economies has not been 

uniform.  In particular, Mexico, with its stronger ties to the United States, was hit earlier 

and harder than many other economies in the region.  Even though Mexico’s recovery in 

the second half of 2009 was strong, it had less momentum and considerable economic 

slack remained in the country.  As such, the Bank of Mexico did not consider it necessary 




- 10 -

to raise policy rates during its recovery period, unlike many other Latin American central 

banks.   

These developments underscore an important point--that while central banks may 

benefit from coordination and cooperation, taking the same policy stance at the same time 

typically will not be the best choice for all central banks.  Accordingly, it is imperative 

for each central bank to have monetary policy tools to appropriately address domestic 

objectives independent of the actions of other central banks.     

Conclusion 
 

In this age of global financial integration, the Federal Reserve and other central 

banks often must cooperate to achieve their individual mandates.  This need for 

coordination has been especially true during the recent crisis, when the actions of central 

banks working together proved very helpful in easing financial strains and boosting 

confidence.  Indeed, closer ties and more-open lines of communication across central 

banks are some positive outcomes of these difficult times.  This spirit of cooperation 

should continue as our respective central banks work to pursue monetary policies 

appropriate for our own economies while supporting stable financial systems around the 

world.
