 By facilitating the allocation of the world’s savings to the most productive uses, 

the free flow of capital across national borders confers substantial economic benefits, 

including the promotion of economic growth.  That said, we have seen a number of 

episodes in which international capital flows have brought with them challenges for 

macroeconomic adjustment, financial stability, or both.  Such challenges have tended to 

arise in two situations:  first, when the “rules of the game” of the international monetary 

system--the policy responses that countries are expected to take to help foster a balanced 

global economy over time--are either poorly articulated or not observed by key countries; 

and second, when the financial systems of nations receiving strong capital inflows have 

not been up to the task of investing those inflows productively.  

These issues are hardly new.  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the U.S. dollar 

and French franc were undervalued, with the result that both countries experienced 

current account surpluses and strong capital inflows.  Under the unwritten but long-

standing rules of the gold standard, those two countries would have been expected to 

allow the inflows to feed through to domestic money supplies and prices, leading to real 

appreciations of their currencies and, with time, to a narrowing of their external 

surpluses.  Instead, the two nations sterilized the effects of these capital inflows on their 

money supplies, so that their currencies remained persistently undervalued.  Under the 

constraints imposed by the gold standard, these policies in turn increased deflationary 

pressures and banking-sector strains in deficit countries such as Germany, which were 

losing gold and foreign deposits.  Ultimately, the unwillingness of the United States and 

France to conduct their domestic policies by the rules of the game, together with

structural vulnerabilities in financial systems and in the gold standard itself, helped 

destabilize the global economic and financial system and bring on the Great Depression. 

The Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s illustrates a somewhat different type 

of risk associated with large cross-border flows of capital.  During the 1990s, strong 

capital inflows helped support robust growth in many Asian economies.  But Thailand’s 

devaluation in mid-1997 triggered closer scrutiny of developments in the region.  

Investors began to recognize that the financial systems of some Asian economies--

because of institutional weaknesses, inadequate regulation, or other deficiencies--had not 

effectively channeled the surge of incoming funds into productive investments.  As 

foreign investors lost confidence, capital flows into the region reversed sharply, and the 

credit-driven boom came to a precipitous end.  The Asian crisis imposed heavy costs in 

terms of financial and macroeconomic instability in the affected countries.  In this case, 

capital inflows posed a problem because of weaknesses in the financial systems and 

regulatory oversight in countries receiving foreign capital.   

Although these issues are now generally discussed in the context of emerging 

market economies, the United States--the recipient of the largest capital inflows in the 

world--has also faced challenges coping with capital inflows.  Notably, the failures of the 

U.S. financial system in allocating strong flows of capital, both domestic and foreign, 

helped precipitate the recent financial crisis and global recession.  

Why was the United States, a mature economy, the recipient of net capital inflows 

that rose to as much as 6 percent of its gross domestic product prior to the financial 

crisis?  A significant portion of these capital inflows reflected a broader phenomenon

that, in the past, I have dubbed the global saving glut.1  Over the past 15 years or so, for 

reasons on which I have elaborated in earlier remarks, many emerging market economies 

have run large, sustained current account surpluses and thus have become exporters of 

capital to the advanced economies, especially the United States.  These inflows 

exacerbated the U.S. current account deficit and were also a factor pushing U.S. and 

global longer-term interest rates below levels suggested by expected short-term rates and 

other macroeconomic fundamentals.    

My earlier comments on the global saving glut hypothesis focused on the sources 

of the capital inflows to the United States and their effects on global longer-term interest 

rates and the U.S. current account, without attention to the composition of those flows.  

My paper for the Banque de France Financial Stability Review extends the basic global 

saving glut hypothesis to consider the portfolio preferences of foreign investors in the 

United States and the implications of those preferences.2  Several researchers have argued 

that capital flows from emerging markets to advanced economies will tend to be directed 

to the safest and most liquid assets, of which, these researchers argue, there is a relative 

shortage in emerging markets.3  My paper confirms empirically that the global saving 

glut countries--principally, some emerging Asian economies and Middle Eastern oil

exporters--did indeed evince a strong preference for very safe and liquid U.S. assets in 

the middle of the past decade, especially Treasury and agency securities. 

Although a large share of the net capital inflows to the United States came from 

emerging markets, substantial gross capital inflows were received from the advanced 

economies as well.  An additional contribution of the paper is to examine the portfolio 

preferences of these advanced economy, especially European, investors.  The paper finds 

that, like the global saving glut countries, European investors placed a high value on 

safety and liquidity in their U.S. investments; however, relative to purchases by emerging 

markets, those of European investors encompassed a broader range of U.S. securities, 

including sizable amounts of private-label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as well as 

other highly rated asset-backed securities.  Unlike the global saving glut countries, which 

funded their acquisitions of U.S. assets through their current account surpluses, Europe 

on net had a roughly balanced current account and thus issued liabilities to fund 

acquisitions of U.S. assets.  However, as these liabilities were tilted toward more 

traditional securities, including sovereign debt, as well as bank deposits, the result here 

too was a net increase in the global demand for highly rated U.S. assets.  

The preferences of foreign investors for highly rated U.S. assets, together with 

similar preferences by many domestic investors, had a number of implications, including 

for the relative yields on such assets.  Importantly, though, the preference by so many 

investors for perceived safety created strong incentives for U.S. financial engineers to 

develop investment products that “transformed” risky loans into highly rated securities.  

Remarkably, even though a large share of new U.S. mortgages during the housing boom 

were of weak credit quality, financial engineering resulted in the overwhelming share of 


- 5 - 
 


private-label mortgage-related securities being rated AAA.  The underlying contradiction 

was, of course, ultimately exposed, at great cost to financial stability and the global 

economy. 

To be clear, these findings are not to be read as assigning responsibility for the 

breakdown in U.S. financial intermediation to factors outside the United States.  Instead, 

in analogy to the Asian crisis, the primary cause of the breakdown was the poor 

performance of the financial system and financial regulation in the country receiving the 

capital inflows, not the inflows themselves.  In the case of the United States, sources of 

poor performance included misaligned incentives in mortgage origination, underwriting, 

and securitization; risk-management deficiencies among financial institutions; conflicts 

of interest at credit rating agencies; weaknesses in the capitalization and incentive 

structures of the government-sponsored enterprises; gaps and weaknesses in the financial 

regulatory structure; and supervisory failures.4  In reflecting on this experience, I have 

gained increased appreciation for the challenges faced by policymakers in emerging 

market economies who have had to manage large and sometimes volatile capital inflows 

for the past several decades. 

The global financial crisis is receding, but capital flows are once again posing 

some notable challenges for international macroeconomic and financial stability.  These 

capital flows reflect in part the continued two-speed nature of the global recovery, as

economic growth in the emerging markets is far outstripping growth in the advanced 

economies.5   

In light of the relatively muted recoveries to date in the advanced economies, the 

central banks of those economies have generally continued accommodative monetary 

policies.  Some observers, while acknowledging that an aborted recovery in the advanced 

economies would be highly detrimental to the emerging market economies, have 

nevertheless argued that these monetary policies are generating negative spillovers.  In 

particular, concerns have centered on the strength of private capital flows to many 

emerging market economies, which, depending on their policy responses, could put 

upward pressure on their currencies, boost their inflation rates, or lead to asset price 

bubbles.   

Although policymakers in the emerging markets clearly face important 

challenges, such concerns should be put into perspective.  First, these capital flows have 

been driven by many factors, including expectations of more-rapid growth and thus 

higher investment returns in the emerging market economies than in the advanced 

economies.  Indeed, recent data suggest that the aggregate flows to emerging markets are 

not out of line with longer-term trends.  Second, as I noted earlier, emerging market 

economies have a strong interest in a continued economic recovery in the advanced 

economies, which accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies are 

intended to promote.  Third, policymakers in the emerging markets have a range of 

powerful--although admittedly imperfect--tools that they can use to manage their 

economies and prevent overheating, including exchange rate adjustment, monetary and

fiscal policies, and macroprudential measures.  Finally, it should be borne in mind that 

spillovers can go both ways.  For example, resurgent demand in the emerging markets 

has contributed significantly to the sharp recent run-up in global commodity prices.  

More generally, the maintenance of undervalued currencies by some countries has 

contributed to a pattern of global spending that is unbalanced and unsustainable.  Such 

imbalances include those not only between emerging markets and advanced economies, 

but also among the emerging market economies themselves, as those countries that have 

allowed their exchange rates to be determined primarily by market forces have seen their 

competitiveness erode relative to countries that have intervened more aggressively in 

foreign exchange markets.     

Our collective challenge is to reshape the international monetary system to foster 

strong, sustainable growth and improve economic outcomes for all nations.  Working 

together, we need to clarify and strengthen the rules of the game, with an eye toward 

creating an international system that more effectively supports the simultaneous pursuit 

of internal and external balance.  To achieve a more balanced international system over 

time, countries with excessive and unsustainable trade surpluses will need to allow their 

exchange rates to better reflect market fundamentals and increase their efforts to 

substitute domestic demand for exports.  At the same time, countries with large, 

persistent trade deficits must find ways to increase national saving, including putting 

fiscal policies on a more sustainable trajectory.  In addition, to bolster our individual and 

collective ability to manage and productively invest capital inflows, we must continue to 

increase the efficiency, transparency, and resiliency of our national financial systems and 

to strengthen financial regulation and oversight.

None of these changes will be easy or immediate.  To help us achieve them, we 

must continue to strengthen our mechanisms for international cooperation, including in 

the Basel Committee, the Financial Stability Board, and the Group of Twenty Mutual 

Assessment Process, and work together to enhance surveillance by the International 

Monetary Fund.       

 I am pleased that our French hosts are focusing the work of the Group of Twenty 

on these challenging, but crucially important, issues.  I am hopeful that we will make 

substantive progress on them in the year ahead--an outcome that will strengthen the 

global economy and benefit all countries.
