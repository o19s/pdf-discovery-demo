January 6, 2012 





 It is the start of a new year, the traditional time for making forecasts, so I am 

pleased to be here today to offer my perspective on recent economic developments and 

on the outlook for the U.S. economy.  After a rough patch early in 2011, the economy 

appears to have regained a little momentum near the end of the year, and I expect that 

it will most likely continue on a path of gradual recovery in 2012.  Because conditions 

in the housing market are such a strong drag on recovery, I will also outline some 

initiatives that I believe have the potential to accelerate improvement in that sector.  

Before I begin, I want to emphasize that the views that I will be presenting are my 

own and not necessarily those of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC) or the Board of Governors. 

Recent Economic Developments 

 Following the sharp downturn in 2008 and the first half of 2009, real economic 

activity has now been expanding for more than two years (chart 1).  However, the 

recovery has not been as strong as might have been expected given the steepness of 

the contraction.  Early last year it threatened to stall out altogether.  To be sure, 

economic growth in the first half of last year was depressed by some transitory factors, 

including high energy prices and the effects of the tragic earthquake in Japan on the 

production of motor vehicles.  Still, even as these influences on the economy waned 

over the second half of 2011, economic activity appears to have increased at only a 

moderate pace.   

 Perhaps the most telling measure of the subpar pace of recovery is the painfully 

slow improvement in the labor market.  Employment gains were tepid last year and 

made only a small dent in the large number of people who are still out of work (chart 


 - 2 -

2).  In recent months, there have been glimmers of hope seen in the job market.  For 

example, payroll employment rose 200,000 in December and the unemployment rate, 

which had hovered around 9 percent for most of the year, fell to 8.5 percent, a rate that 

while still far too high was the lowest in 2-1/2 years (chart 3).  That said, other 

economic data have improved more modestly, and the bulk of the evidence, including 

help-wanted advertising and surveys of employers’ hiring plans, suggests that the job 

market is not poised for marked improvement in the months ahead.  Indeed, my own 

expectation is that while the trend in unemployment will be gradually lower, the path 

to get there might be choppy.  

 On a brighter note, consumer spending looked a bit stronger in the latter part of 

last year after an anemic first half (chart 4).  The pickup in consumer spending was 

fairly widespread through November and, although we don’t yet have a full set of 

December data in hand, sales of motor vehicles remained solid at an annual rate of 

13.5 million units last month, and reports of holiday spending were upbeat.  That said, 

there are some reasons not to get too optimistic about this sector of the economy:  

Many of the underlying forces that typically support consumer spending are still quite 

weak, including the high unemployment rate, sluggish income growth, sentiment that 

remains relatively low despite recent improvements (chart 5), and the lingering effects 

of the earlier declines in household wealth. 

  Housing markets--which I will discuss in more detail shortly--have shown only 

slight signs of improvement:  Housing demand and homebuilding (chart 6) continue to 

be restrained by weak income and sentiment, tight lending standards, and a large 

overhang of vacant properties (chart 7).

 As for the business sector, the uncertain durability of the recovery appears to be 

discouraging businesses from decisively increasing their productive capacity.  

Notwithstanding a surge around mid-2011, on balance, firms appear to have increased 

their spending on equipment and structures at a less robust pace in 2011 than they did 

in the prior year.  The pace of inventory accumulation was also quite modest.  The 

most recent indicators suggest more of the same:  Orders and shipments of capital 

goods have been subdued in the past few months, commercial vacancy rates remain 

elevated (chart 8), and most indicators of business sentiment remain mediocre 

(chart 9).   

 The government sector also continues to be a substantial drag on activity, both at 

the federal level (chart 10)--where defense and nondefense spending look to have 

dropped last year--and at the state and local levels (chart 11).  The declines in state and 

local government expenditures reflect continuing cutbacks in both employment and 

construction outlays.  The budgets of these governments are quite strained by the 

ongoing phase-out of federal stimulus grants and the weakness of local tax collections. 

 One area of the economy that has been performing relatively favorably is the 

trade sector.  In the third quarter, the annualized growth rate of exports of domestically 

produced goods and services was about 5 percent, while net exports--that is, exports 

less imports--contributed nearly one half of a percentage point to the increase in real 

GDP, about one-fourth of the overall gain (chart 12).  However, in recent weeks, many 

forecasters have weakened their global outlooks substantially, which certainly does 

not bode well for U.S. exports going forward. 


 - 4 -

 Turning to inflation, after a surge early last year, the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures decelerated considerably toward the end of the year and 

rose at an annual rate of just 1/4 percent in the three months ending in November 

(chart 13).  This welcome news likely reflects the waning of the effects of the large 

run-ups in the prices of crude oil and other commodities early last year as well as 

some reversal of the increase in motor vehicle prices that followed the earthquake-

related supply disruptions last spring.  

The Economic Outlook 

 Looking forward, my baseline forecast is for economic activity to gradually pick 

up steam over the next year or so.  I recognize that some of the factors holding back 

the pace of activity are likely to persist.  For example, with sluggish employment 

growth, household income may not be strong enough to support sustained increases in 

consumer spending.  Government spending will likely continue to be a drag on 

economic growth going forward.  Under current federal law and most projected 

outcomes of congressional budget negotiations, some ongoing fiscal restraint seems 

probable at the federal level.  Moreover, state and local budgets are likely to remain 

under severe pressure for some time, leading these jurisdictions to continue to scale 

back spending.  And, as I said earlier, a weak forecast for global growth indicates that 

net exports may provide less support to the U.S. recovery going forward. 

 However, I do believe that the headwinds from tight credit conditions for 

businesses and households, with the exception of mortgage credit, are beginning to 

subside.  Financial institutions in the United States have stronger capital positions than 

they did in 2008, and the Federal Reserve continues to regularly test the ability of the 


 - 5 -

largest institutions to withstand economic stress (chart 14).  Bank deposits have grown 

substantially, thereby allowing many banks to reduce their dependence on more 

volatile wholesale funding (chart 15).  And, although loan balances have increased in 

recent months, they remain well below their peak levels, leaving banks with 

substantial liquidity.  Measures of credit stress such as reductions in nonperforming 

assets, delinquencies, and charge-off rates show steady improvement in credit quality.   

As a result, most banks are now actively seeking loan growth to improve their 

profitability.  In fact, competition for loans, along with an improving outlook for the 

economy, has caused lenders to ease their standards from the stringent ones applied 

during the recession.  In the area of business lending, the Federal Reserve’s latest 

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) (chart 16) 

and the Survey of Terms of Business Lending (chart 17) indicate improving conditions 

for corporate borrowers.1  To a lesser extent, but still showing some easing, are 

standards for small business and commercial real estate loans. 

In the household sector, I believe that high profile problems in the mortgage 

market may have distracted attention from a noticeable improvement in some 

measures of the household debt burden.  The total debt owed by households as a share 

of their income, which was rising through 2007, has been falling since then (chart 18).  

In addition, the ratio of household debt payments to income has dropped precipitously 

in recent years.  In a sign that consumers who still have debt are having less difficulty 

making their payments, delinquency and charge-off rates on credit card and auto loans

have returned to pre-crisis levels (chart 19), and even mortgage delinquency rates have 

declined somewhat from the extraordinarily high peaks reached in late 2009.  

 Of course, some of the causes of the declining debt ratios are not the kinds of 

things you would typically describe as grounds for optimism.  In particular, one reason 

that many households owe less debt today than in recent years is that banks wrote off 

an unprecedented amount of loans between 2008 and 2011, much of it as a result of 

foreclosure or bankruptcy.  However, although bankruptcies and foreclosures are 

wrenching events for the households involved, the associated discharge of debt can lay 

the foundation for a fresh start once income prospects improve.  

 While unusually high charge-offs tell part of the declining household debt story, 

a drop-off in new loans--resulting from both tepid loan demand and tight loan supply--

likely played a larger role.  Loan demand weakened during the recession as 

households delayed purchasing houses and consumer goods because of rising 

unemployment, weak income growth, and the steep declines in household wealth.  At 

the same time, lenders responded to high delinquency rates by tightening credit 

standards. 

 Although mortgage credit conditions remain tight, much of the tightening in 

other consumer credit markets appears to be unwinding.  As indicated on the SLOOS, 

the number of loan officers reporting easing standards for consumer loans now 

exceeds those reporting tightening standards and the willingness of banks to make 

consumer installment loans has rebounded (chart 20).  Standards for credit cards are 

still restrictive relative to those that prevailed before the crisis, but this may be a 

response to legislation that changed the regulations governing credit cards in addition 


 - 7 -

to economic conditions.  But, even here, fewer loan officers reported reducing credit 

card limits and raising credit card interest rates relative to their cost of funds.      

 I consider the recent signs of new life in the consumer credit markets to be cause 

for optimism because they suggest that when households do regain confidence in the 

recovery and are ready to begin spending on consumer goods again, the credit markets 

will not be as much of a constraint as they were during the recession.  Indeed, an 

upside risk to my forecast is that consumers who postponed spending during the past 

few years could decide to unexpectedly take the plunge and make those purchases.  

For example, auto purchases seem to be especially good candidates for surprise as the 

average age of cars on the road indicates pent-up demand and credit is readily 

accessible.  Moreover, as households gain confidence that job and income prospects 

are improving, that should provide a further boost to spending and loan demand. 

   Businesses are in an even better position than households to increase spending 

as confidence returns.  Corporate cash positions are at record highs, and corporate debt 

is at similarly low levels (chart 21).  Although business spending has thus far powered 

much of the recovery, businesses have still only been spending at a pace sufficient to 

replace outworn capital and to support increases in capacity that are pretty modest for 

a business cycle recovery.  As businesses become more certain of the durability of the 

recovery, I expect that they will become more willing to further expand productive 

capacity, particularly with new business equipment and software. 

Of course, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant 

downside risks to the economic outlook.  Monetary accommodation works, in part, by 

lowering interest rates, increasing equity prices, and bolstering the availability of 


 - 8 -

credit for households and firms.  But central banks around the world are finding that 

the beneficial effects of their monetary policies on financial conditions are being 

offset, to some extent, as movements in financial markets are increasingly driven by 

headlines regarding actual, contemplated, or even rumored action by European 

officials.  And the potential fallout from the sovereign debt crisis in Europe remains a 

serious concern.  Although European authorities are taking steps to address the 

region’s fiscal problems and shore up its banking system, there is some risk that 

financial difficulties in the euro zone could intensify substantially.  In such 

circumstances, the direct hit to U.S. trade associated with a deep recession in Europe 

could be considerable.  Given the significant financial linkages between the United 

States and Europe, a worsening crisis in Europe would likely lead to additional strains 

in U.S. financial markets, resulting in yet another blow to the U.S. economy.   

Proposals to Support Housing Market Recovery 

 Back on U.S. shores, I want to focus the remainder of my discussion today on 

the housing and mortgage markets, which are so important for the economic recovery.  

As I alluded to earlier, and as I am sure you are all very well aware, housing markets 

have shown little sign of improvement so far in this recovery.  This stands in sharp 

contrast to the important role that the housing sector has typically played in propelling 

economic recoveries (chart 22).  During a downturn, reduced spending on durable 

goods--including housing--generates pent-up demand, which in itself helps sow the 

seeds of recovery.  Once the cycle bottoms out, improving economic prospects and 

diminishing uncertainty usually help unleash this pent-up demand.  This upward 

demand pressure is often augmented by lower interest rates, to which housing demand 


 - 9 -

is typically quite responsive.  Moreover, spillovers from increased housing demand--

such as wealth effects from higher house prices, purchases of complementary goods 

such as furniture and appliances, as well as strengthening bank balance sheets--have, 

in the past, provided a powerful additional impetus to the recovery. 

 Thus far, however, the housing sector has not contributed to the recovery.  In 

addition to the lack of any meaningful improvement in residential construction, the 

expansion has also been hindered by the steep descent of house prices.  To date, house 

prices have fallen by nearly one-third from their peak (chart 23), pushing home equity 

as a share of personal income to its lowest level on record (chart 24) and wiping out $7 

trillion of housing equity.  Further, this decline in housing wealth--and the associated 

hit to consumer confidence--has not only been a meaningful and persistent drag on 

overall consumer spending, it has also been enough to push nearly 12 million 

homeowners underwater on their mortgages, that is their houses are now worth less 

than their mortgage balances (chart 25).  Without equity in their homes, many 

households who have suffered hardships such as unemployment or unexpected illness 

have been unable to resolve mortgage payment problems through refinancing their 

mortgages or selling their homes.  The resulting mortgage delinquencies have ended in 

all too many cases in foreclosure, dislocation, and personal hardship.  Neighborhoods 

and communities have also suffered profoundly from the onslaught of foreclosures, as 

the neglect and deterioration that frequently accompany vacant properties makes 

neighborhoods less desirable places to live and may put further downward pressure on 

house prices.2   

                                                 
2 See, for example, John Y. Campbell, Stefano Giglio, and Parag Pathak (2011), “Forced Sales and House 
Prices,” American Economic Review, vol. 101(15), pp. 2108-31; and John P. Harding, Eric Rosenblatt, and 


 - 10 -

 The problems that led to the mortgage crisis and the potential policy solutions to 

those problems are numerous and varied.  Even though time does not permit a full 

discussion of them here, I do believe that forceful and effective housing policies have 

the potential to significantly influence the speed and strength of our economic 

recovery.  The Federal Reserve has already acted to reduce mortgage rates by 

purchasing longer-term assets, in particular through the purchase of agency mortgage-

backed securities.  Indeed, low rates combined with falling house prices have 

contributed to historically high levels of housing affordability (chart 26).  At the same 

time, rents have been rising, which should make homeownership a more attractive 

option relative to rental housing (chart 27).   

Despite this record affordability, home purchase and mortgage refinancing 

activity remains muted.  The failure of home sales to respond to conditions that would 

otherwise seem favorable to home purchases indicates that there are other factors 

weighing on demand for owner-occupied homes.  High levels of unemployment and 

weak income prospects are likely precluding many households from purchasing 

homes.  In addition, some potential buyers may be delaying house purchases out of 

fear of purchasing into a falling market.  Weak prices also contribute to the reportedly 

large number of purchase contracts that are canceled due to appraisals that come in too 

low to support financing. 

 Finally, many households are unable to purchase homes because of mortgage 

credit conditions, which are substantially tighter now than they were prior to the 

recession.  Some of this tightening is appropriate, as mortgage lending standards were

lax, at best, in the years before the peak in house prices.  However, the extraordinarily 

tight standards that currently prevail reflect, in part, new obstacles that inhibit lending 

even to creditworthy borrowers.  These tight standards can take many forms, including 

stricter underwriting, higher fees and interest rates, more stringent documentation 

requirements, larger required down payments, stricter appraisal standards, and fewer 

available mortgage products.  This tightening in mortgage credit can be seen in the 

increase in the credit scores associated with newly originated prime and Federal 

Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage originations (charts 28 and 29), which 

suggests that borrowers who likely had access to mortgage credit a few years ago are 

now essentially excluded from the mortgage market. 

Tight standards are an obstacle to mortgage refinancing as well.  The credit 

scores on new refinancings have risen in line with the credit scores on home purchase 

loans.  Low or negative home equity presents an additional barrier to refinancing, with 

perhaps only about half of homeowners who could profitably refinance having the 

equity and creditworthiness needed to qualify for traditional refinancing.  Although 

government programs have facilitated refinancing for many borrowers, many others 

have still not benefited from the low levels of interest rates. 

 Surprisingly, this tightness persists even when guarantees from the government-

sponsored enterprises (GSEs) or the FHA are available to shield lenders from credit 

risk.  Estimates by Federal Reserve staff suggest that less than half of lenders currently 

offer purchase mortgages to borrowers whose credit metrics fall into the lower range 

of GSE purchase parameters (chart 30).  Lenders reportedly attribute this hesitancy to 

concerns about the high cost of servicing in the event of loan delinquency, and to fears 


 - 12 -

that the GSEs could force lenders to repurchase loans if the borrower defaults.  

Although this ability of the GSEs to “put back” loans to lenders helps protect the 

taxpayers from losses, an open question is whether the costs of the associated 

contraction in credit availability outweigh the benefits of risk mitigation.   

At the same time that housing demand has weakened, the number of homes for 

sale is elevated relative to historical norms, due in large part to the swollen inventory 

of homes held by banks, guarantors, and servicers after completion of foreclosure 

proceedings. 3  These properties are known as real estate owned, or REO, properties.     

Furthermore, sales by REO owners are often characterized as distressed sales because 

the regulatory and contractual constraints they face affect their options and incentives 

for disposing of the properties and may affect their willingness to improve the 

properties or to sell them at a discount, which in turn would affect home prices beyond 

the increase in overall supply.   

Since 2008, distressed sales have consistently accounted for one-third or more of 

existing home sales, compared with only a small fraction of sales in preceding decades 

(chart 31).  In addition to increasing the supply of homes for sale, these distressed 

sales may have an effect on all house prices in a given area if appraisers do not adjust 

for the differences between distressed and nondistressed sales.  And as these 

discounted transactions go on the books, they can effectively contribute to tighter 

credit conditions both because they might lower mortgage appraisals for nearby 

nondistressed properties and because mortgage lenders are motivated to offer tighter 

                                                 
3 Although the numbers are difficult to measure precisely, estimates by Federal Reserve staff suggest that 
perhaps as many as one-fourth of the 2 million houses for sale in the second quarter of 2011 were REO 
properties, with an anticipated future inflow of foreclosures perhaps as high as 1 million units in both 2012 
and 2013.

credit terms in declining markets.  Taken together, these mechanisms create a negative 

feedback loop between prices, credit terms, and inventories of distressed property in 

falling markets that may cause prices to overshoot their underlying values. 

Given the severity of problems with supply and demand in the housing market, 

it is unlikely that any single policy solution will provide the full answer, but a number 

of different policies each have the potential to yield incremental improvement in 

housing and economic recovery.  In the long term, policymakers will need to decide 

the future role, if any, that the government will play in housing finance.  And they will 

need to decide how to best wean the GSEs away from government conservatorship.  In 

the short term, however, I believe policymakers should at least consider policies that 

take into account the role the GSEs could play in hastening the healing of the housing 

market rather than focusing entirely on minimizing losses to the GSEs.  In the end, 

breaking the current logjam created by large numbers of loans severely past due or in 

foreclosure and high levels of distressed sales should help reduce losses to the GSEs 

by breaking the downward cycle in prices.  And, I think it is plausible that a faster 

recovery in the housing markets could speed, rather than slow, the end of GSE 

conservatorship.   

In recent months, a group of staff at the Federal Reserve has been studying ways 

in which the housing market is hindering the economic recovery and possible 

remedies for those difficulties.  This week we published a white paper that discusses 

issues and trade-offs to consider in developing policies that would facilitate recovery 


 - 14 -

in the housing market.  It contains discussions of a number of policies that I believe, if 

implemented effectively, could result in better economic performance.4  

For example, policies that increase credit availability for homeowners or 

investors seeking to purchase a home or to refinance an existing mortgage would 

allow more borrowers to access lower interest rates and thus improve the transmission 

of monetary policy to the economy.  Renewed attention to a broad menu of options to 

modify existing mortgages would provide aid to struggling homeowners and would 

help to reduce the flow of foreclosed homes into distressed inventory.  When 

foreclosure cannot be avoided, incentives provided to homeowners that encourage 

short sales and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure can reduce the time and costs of 

foreclosure and minimize negative effects on communities.   

In addition, expanding the options available for holders of foreclosed properties 

to dispose of their inventory responsibly could reduce the number of distressed sales 

and the effect of those sales on home prices.  For example, in many housing markets 

the demand for rental housing is much stronger relative to supply than in the market 

for owner-occupied homes.  Reducing some of the barriers to converting foreclosed 

properties to rental units will help to redeploy the existing stock of houses in a more 

efficient way.  Along the same lines, aggressive neighborhood stabilization efforts, 

including transferring low-value properties to public or nonprofit entities, such as land 

banks, that can manage properties that are not dealt with adequately through the

Conditions and Policy Considerations,” white paper (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal 
Reserve System, January).  www.federalreserve.gov/publications/other-reports/files/housing-white-paper-
20120104.pdf.

private market, could lessen the effect of foreclosures on the prices of homes in the 

surrounding neighborhoods. 

 Finally, the housing crisis highlighted the destructive power of weak 

underwriting, inadequate disclosure, conflicting incentives, incomplete data, and 

uneven infrastructure.  Any long-term solution must address all of these issues through 

regulation, standardization of contracts, and effective use of technology.  Private 

investors are not likely to return to mortgage markets until there are common 

standards as well as consistency and transparency in both mortgage securitization and 

mortgage servicing.  A modern national lien registry that clearly identifies the current 

servicer of a mortgage and all the liens that encumber the property could increase 

transparency, improve the quality of mortgage servicing, and facilitate loan 

modifications.  

 As I noted earlier, I believe that continued weakness in the housing market poses 

a significant barrier to a more vigorous economic recovery.  Although there is no 

miracle cure here, these actions have the potential to help the economy recuperate 

more quickly than I currently expect it to, moving us closer to full employment sooner 

and improving the lives of many Americans. 

Conclusion 

 To sum up, I expect continued moderate recovery in 2012.  My forecast is for 

the unemployment rate to gradually (and perhaps fitfully) move lower and for inflation 

to settle over coming quarters at or below levels consistent with the Federal Reserve’s 

dual mandate.  In this environment, I believe that the current stance of monetary 

policy is appropriate.  However, the economic situation remains very uncertain, and I 


 - 16 -

see considerable risks, on both the downside and the upside, to the forecast I’ve laid 

out here.  While potential spillover from the situation in Europe certainly represents a 

downside risk to this forecast, I also believe that the steadily improving consumer debt 

picture represents an upside risk.  And any acceleration in the repair of housing and 

mortgage markets could add even stronger momentum to recovery.  As always, the 

FOMC will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information, 

and we are prepared to employ our tools as appropriate to foster economic recovery in 

a context of price stability.
