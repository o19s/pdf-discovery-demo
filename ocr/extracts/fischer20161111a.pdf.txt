I am grateful for the invitation to speak to you today about how U.S. monetary 

policy affects the global economy and how foreign economic events affect U.S. monetary 

policy.  Given the importance of the United States in international trade and in the global 

financial system, the monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve influence the global 

economy through a wide range of trade and financial channels.  As I will discuss, each 

foreign economy may be affected quite differently by U.S. monetary policy actions, and 

each may view spillovers from U.S. monetary policy as desirable or undesirable.  Even 

so, I am reasonably confident that the spillovers from ongoing U.S. monetary policy 

normalization will generally prove manageable for foreign economies.1   

While most of my discussion will focus on monetary policy spillovers, I will 

begin by underscoring a different aspect of the interconnectedness of the U.S. economy--

namely, how foreign developments have an important influence on U.S. output and 

inflation, and hence on the conduct of U.S. monetary policy.  

How Foreign Developments Influence U.S. Monetary Policy 

The U.S. economy is affected significantly by foreign developments through both 

trade and financial channels.  Given that about one-eighth of the goods and services 

produced in the United States are exported, a sizable component of U.S. aggregate 

demand depends on foreign consumption and investment decisions, and hence ultimately 

on the economic health of foreign economies.  The high degree of interconnectedness 

between domestic and foreign financial intermediaries--banks, the nonbank financial 

sector, and insurers, among others--means that developments in foreign financial markets

Committee.

tend to reverberate quickly back to the United States, including through changes in asset 

prices and risk tolerance.  The pronounced tightening of U.S. financial conditions during 

the euro-area sovereign debt crisis that occurred from 2011 to 2012 illustrated the 

strength of these financial ties.  

During the past couple of years, foreign developments have at times been a 

substantial headwind for the U.S. economy.  Although financial conditions have 

improved markedly in the advanced foreign economies and their monetary policy has 

been highly accommodative, these economies have yet to break out from the tepid growth 

they have experienced since the global financial crisis.  Growth in the emerging market 

economies has also been disappointingly slow.  For example, gross domestic product 

(GDP) growth in Latin America declined to zero last year, far below the 3 to 4 percent 

growth rates achieved in the first few years of this decade.2  The emerging market 

economies (EMEs) have weathered several bouts of financial market turbulence, 

including earlier this year, due to market concerns about economic growth in China and 

about its exchange rate system.  With foreign growth relatively weak, the prospect of a 

gradual normalization of U.S. monetary policy contributed to a large appreciation of the 

dollar since mid-2014, with the real effective exchange value of the dollar rising around 

17 percent.   

 These global developments materially slowed progress toward the Federal 

Reserve’s employment and inflation objectives.  The sizable appreciation of the dollar 

has been a substantial drag on U.S. exports over the past two years, and hence subtracted 

from economic growth.  The stronger dollar, in concert with lower oil and other

Outlook and report GDP growth for Latin America and the Caribbean.

commodity prices, has also markedly reduced import price inflation and has been a factor 

keeping inflation well below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 percent 

goal.3  These developments have influenced the FOMC’s decisions to maintain a very 

accommodative monetary policy longer than members of the FOMC had expected in 

2014 and through the end of 2015.    

Financial market conditions have generally improved relative to earlier in the 

year, with even the initial market turbulence following the Brexit vote appearing fairly 

short lived.  I am cautiously optimistic that the drag on the U.S. economy and inflation 

from past dollar appreciation may have mostly worked itself out, and that foreign 

economies are on a somewhat more secure footing that poses smaller downside risks to 

the U.S. economy.  It is also possible that foreign economies may outperform forecasts, 

which would provide a boost to U.S. employment prospects and also to inflation.  While 

forecasts are inherently uncertain, we will, as always, pay close attention to foreign 

developments, given their significant consequences for the U.S. economy, and take such 

developments into account in determining the appropriate stance of U.S. monetary policy.  

 
Key Channels through Which U.S. Monetary Policy Affects Foreign Economies 

I have focused thus far on the effects of global developments on the U.S. 

economy and financial markets and argued that these developments may have an 

important influence on U.S. monetary policy actions.  I will next consider how U.S. 

monetary policy actions tend to affect foreign economies.  Spillovers from the policy 

                                                 
3  My 2015 speech “The Transmission of Exchange Rate Changes to Output and Inflation” provides some 
quantitative assessment of how changes in the dollar affect U.S. output and inflation, including estimates 
from the staff’s empirical model of U.S. trade described in a recent IFDP Notes article by Gruber, 
McCallum, and Vigfusson (2016).

actions of major central banks, including especially those of the Federal Reserve, have 

been the focus of analysis and debate for decades and have attracted considerable 

attention since the global financial crisis.4   Foreign economies were affected when the 

Fed engaged in unconventional monetary policy stimulus and will likely experience some 

effects of the Fed’s ongoing normalization of policy.  

The Federal Reserve’s focus on supporting domestic objectives for inflation and 

employment has sometimes been criticized as having potentially undesirable effects on 

the global economy.  The unconventional policies that the Federal Reserve implemented 

following the global financial crisis, and particularly our large-scale asset purchases, have 

been characterized by some observers as supporting the U.S. economy by putting 

downward pressure on the dollar and thus hurting our trading partners.5  

My reading of the evidence is that, overall, Federal Reserve policies during that 

period probably boosted foreign economic output.  It is indeed likely that the depreciation 

of the dollar that accompanied U.S. asset purchases and forward guidance reduced 

foreign net exports and thus weighed on foreign GDP through the exchange rate channel.  

However, our accommodative policies also increased U.S. domestic demand, a second 

key channel of transmission that operated to boost the net exports of our foreign trading 

partners.  Empirical estimates suggest that these countervailing effects roughly canceled 

                                                 
4 Exchange rate issues leading up to the Great Depression were prominent, particularly vis-à-vis the French 
franc, which was returned to the gold standard at what was seen at the time as a highly favorable rate 
(Irwin, 2012).  The pioneering analysis of Mundell (1963) and Fleming (1962) provides the standard 
framework for post-World War II analysis of the channels through which monetary policy actions are 
transmitted abroad.  In recent years, there has been a rapidly expanding empirical literature assessing 
spillovers from Federal Reserve policy actions, including those from unconventional policies such as large-
scale asset purchases--for example, Fratzscher, DeLuca, and Straub (2013); Rogers, Scotti, and Wright 
(2014); and Neely (2015).   
5 Bernanke (2015) discusses some of these critiques of Fed policy in the context of a more general analysis 
of how Fed policies have affected the global economy since the financial crisis.

each other out, on average, for our trading partners so that their net exports were not very 

much affected.6  Moreover, insofar as our unconventional policies reduced global interest 

rates and boosted asset prices--a third channel that tended to expand foreign as well as 

domestic demand--these actions were probably mildly stimulative for the global 

economy.  

It may be helpful to provide some ballpark numerical estimates of how these 

different channels are likely to play out in determining the overall spillovers to foreign 

GDP by drawing on the research of my Federal Reserve colleagues.7  Specifically, they 

considered the spillovers from a hypothetical easing of Fed policy scaled to cause the 

yield on a 10-year U.S. Treasury note to fall 25 basis points.8  This easing by the Fed 

raises U.S. GDP about 0.5 percent, and--based on event-study analysis--causes the U.S. 

dollar to depreciate by about 1 percent or perhaps a bit less.  While foreign exports are 

hurt due to the implied appreciation of foreign currencies--reducing foreign GDP about 

0.15 percent, according to their estimates--foreign exports are boosted by nearly the same 

amount due to the policy-induced expansion of U.S. domestic demand.  Thus, the overall 

effect on foreign GDP arising through these two trade channels is negligible.  However, 

given that the fall in U.S. interest rates tends to reduce foreign interest rates--at least on 

average--by around half as much, my colleagues concluded that U.S. monetary stimulus 

likely has noticeable positive spillovers to foreign economies.       

                                                 
6 See Ammer and others (2016) for both a detailed discussion of these channels and estimates of the effects 
of U.S. monetary policy actions on foreign economies.   
7 See the discussion in section II of Ammer and others (2016).   
8 The policy rate would have to decline by much more than 25 basis points in order to induce the yield on a 
10-year U.S. Treasury note to fall by this amount. 


 - 6 - 

Of course, there is considerable variation in how Fed policy actions--whether 

easing or tightening--affect the output of different foreign economies.  Economies with 

more open capital accounts and that keep their exchange rate relatively stable against the 

dollar experience larger positive effects on their GDP of an expansionary Fed monetary 

policy action.  The larger positive spillovers reflect the fact that their own interest rates 

move more in lockstep with U.S. interest rates, while the effects on their traded goods 

sector from the exchange rate channel are smaller.  For example, Hong Kong, which has 

pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate since 1983, is an extreme 

illustration of an economy in which Fed actions pass through almost one to one to 

domestic interest rates.  Conversely, spillovers from U.S. policy actions tend to be 

smaller to economies that have flexible exchange rates and adjust their policy rates based 

on domestic conditions; or, alternatively, to economies with less open capital accounts 

such as China.  

Most of the advanced foreign economies eventually welcomed the positive 

spillovers to their domestic output that were due to U.S. unconventional monetary policy 

easing.  Because these economies generally experienced slower recoveries than the 

United States as well as undesirably low inflation, their central banks also wanted to 

pursue highly accommodative policies and took complementary actions--including 

forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases--to spur economic recovery.      

By contrast, the Fed’s monetary easing presented the EMEs with more difficult 

tradeoffs.  Output in many EMEs expanded rapidly during the recovery from the global 

financial crisis, fueled by strong capital inflows and a boom in oil and commodity prices.  

Given that the Fed’s easing raised equity prices and strengthened the demand for risky 


 - 7 - 

assets around the globe, it probably contributed to the growing resource pressures in 

some of these economies.  EMEs had to choose between an accommodative monetary 

policy that was more in line with the United States and other advanced economies versus 

a tighter policy stance likely to cause their exchange rates to appreciate markedly and 

possibly cause a relatively sharp contraction in the tradable sectors of their economies.  

While the more accommodative stance had the attractive feature that it would lessen the 

hurt to the export sector, the downside was that it was more likely to lead to overheating 

and high inflation that could be costly to correct.    

My sense is that most EME central banks had considerable latitude to keep 

inflation near target and output near potential through maintaining a relatively tight 

policy, and thus to limit spillovers from easing by the advanced economies.  But while I 

think that there is a strong case for focusing on a limited set of objectives, including to 

ensure that inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, it is also important to 

recognize the tough tradeoffs faced by EME central banks given their understandable 

desire to avoid causing a sharp slowdown in exports.  The tradeoff faced by EME central 

bankers helps illustrate some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence 

between the United States and other economies closely tied to it through economic and 

financial channels. 

Notwithstanding these challenges, I should underscore that the Federal Reserve’s 

aggressive monetary easing contributed to a faster stabilization and recovery of the U.S. 

economy.  This benefited the global economy by mitigating a major source of downside 

risk, thus improving global risk sentiment and confidence.  Moreover, the Fed’s monetary 

policy actions were reinforced by many steps to help safeguard the U.S. financial system

and increase its resilience to shocks.  These efforts included strengthening the banking 

system’s capital buffers, implementing stress tests, reforming short-term wholesale 

funding markets, and developing swap lines with foreign central banks to help alleviate 

shortages of dollar liquidity during periods of financial stress.  While ultimately aimed at 

the well-being of U.S. households and firms in pursuit of our domestic objectives, these 

efforts to improve U.S. financial stability also had favorable externalities for the global 

financial system and thus helped the global recovery.    

U.S. Monetary Policy Going Forward:  Prospective Divergence 

Policy divergence remains a familiar theme today, but the focus has obviously 

shifted to the consequences of a tightening in U.S. monetary policy on the rest of the 

global economy.  In my view, the Fed appears reasonably close to achieving both the 

inflation and employment components of its mandate.  Accordingly, the case for 

removing accommodation gradually is quite strong, keeping in mind that the future is 

uncertain and that monetary policy is not on a preset course.  By contrast, the major 

foreign economies--including the advanced foreign economies and many EMEs--are at a 

different state of their business cycle and likely to maintain a high level of 

accommodation for some time or even ease further.  So there is likely to be considerable 

policy rate divergence for some time.  What are the likely consequences of this 

divergence for the foreign economies?   

The “taper tantrum” that occurred in the middle of 2013 is interpreted by many 

observers as illustrating how monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve can exert a 

strong contractionary effect on our foreign trading partners through its effect on global 

financial conditions, just as the high level of Fed accommodation after the financial crisis 


 - 9 - 

provided a net boost to the global economy.  Indeed, the large rise in U.S. bond yields 

during this episode precipitated a nearly commensurate rise in interest rates in many 

foreign economies and caused the prices of risky assets to fall globally.  EMEs with weak 

fundamentals experienced sharp capital outflows, an abrupt tightening of financial 

conditions, and large exchange rate depreciations.9  The EME experience in 2013 seemed 

reminiscent of past episodes of U.S. tightening--including in the 1980s and again in the 

mid-1990s--that had sizable adverse spillovers to EMEs, particularly in Latin America. 

I am reasonably optimistic that the spillovers from ongoing U.S. normalization 

will be manageable for the foreign economies, including the EMEs.  While there will 

almost inevitably be some bumps along the road, there are a number of reasons why I 

think that that policy normalization will not cause sizable disruptions for our trading 

partners: 

• First, the Fed will remove accommodation only in response to an outlook for 

improving economic conditions and firming inflation.  The stronger U.S. 

economy and associated improvements in business and consumer confidence 

should support recoveries abroad through both trade and financial channels and 

lessen perceptions of downside risks to the global recovery.    

• Second, central banks in the advanced foreign economies--and in the EMEs with 

stronger fundamentals--should be able to mitigate an undesirable tightening of 

their own financial conditions through appropriate policy actions.  An important 

lesson of the taper tantrum was that effective communications and actions by 

major central banks, including the European Central Bank and the Bank of 

                                                 
9 See Sahay and others (2014).

England, helped quickly push bond yields back down to levels that these central 

banks regarded as appropriate to their economic situation.  For example, the Bank 

of England’s threshold strategy announced in the summer of 2013--promising to 

keep policy rates extraordinarily low at least until unemployment fell below 7 

percent--lowered the expected path of policy rates significantly by pushing back 

expectations of liftoff.  

• A third reason likely to lessen adverse spillovers is that a number of EMEs have 

markedly improved fundamentals, even relative to several years ago.  India is a 

good example.  India was dubbed one of the “Fragile Five” economies during the 

taper tantrum and, during that episode, experienced large capital outflows, a spike 

in borrowing costs, and sizable exchange rate depreciation.10  Since that time, 

India has markedly improved its macroeconomic framework, cutting its inflation 

rate by half to around 5 percent, anchoring inflation expectations more securely, 

and reducing what had been large and persistent fiscal and current account 

deficits.  Somewhat more generally, the improved macroeconomic frameworks in 

many EMEs achieved over the past couple of decades--with inflation targeting 

often playing a key role--has enabled these economies to pursue countercyclical 

policies to a much greater degree than in the past and should help insulate them 

from monetary policy spillovers.11 

                                                 
10  Basu, Eichengreen, and Gupta (2014) describe how India’s economy and financial markets were 
affected by the taper tantrum. 
11  Coulibaly (2012) draws on a large cross-country data set to investigate empirically the factors that have 
allowed EMEs greater scope to pursue countercyclical monetary policies, and it highlights the importance 
of both inflation targeting and financial reforms that enhance transparency.  


 - 11 - 

• A fourth reason that spillovers could be mitigated is that U.S. policy rates are 

likely to increase only gradually--assuming that economic developments unfold 

reasonably in line with expectations--and to plateau at a significantly lower level 

than the historical average.12  The low long-run level of the policy rate reflects a 

number of factors--including slower productivity growth, demographic change, 

and a higher demand for safe assets--that have pushed down the real long-run 

neutral rate, which is the real interest rate needed to keep the economy at full 

employment in the longer-run.  The upshot is that U.S. policy rates are likely to 

increase more slowly, and by a lower cumulative amount, than in past episodes of 

U.S. monetary tightening.  This in turn should reduce the divergence between the 

stance of U.S. and foreign monetary policies and the associated spillovers arising 

from such divergence.  

While there are good grounds to expect that spillovers from U.S. monetary policy 

actions will be manageable for most of our trading partners, events may unfold 

differently than expected.  To illustrate, a noticeably faster U.S. recovery would require a 

more rapid removal of U.S. accommodation and could exert noticeably larger spillovers 

abroad by putting more upward pressure on foreign interest rates and by inducing larger 

depreciations of foreign currencies.  Despite greater policy divergence, many of our 

trading partners would receive a net boost to their GDP provided that the stimulus to their 

exports--from stronger U.S. demand and a weaker domestic currency--was sufficient to 

offset possible tightening in their financial conditions.  But other economies might be 

hurt as a weaker currency could lead to balance sheet deterioration and rising risk 

                                                 
12 The median assessment of FOMC participants in the September 2016 Summary of Economic Projections 
puts the longer-run level of the nominal federal funds rate at a bit under 3 percent.

spreads, especially if their central banks were called on to tighten monetary policy to 

keep inflation at bay.  

While such uncertainty is a constant feature of the landscape we confront as 

policymakers, both the U.S. and global economies will be served best if we keep our own 

houses in order and ensure that policy rates are adjusted as appropriate to achieve our 

inflation and employment objectives.  In my view, the prospects of a continued steady 

expansion in the U.S. economy are maximized to the extent that we proceed with a 

gradual removal of accommodation.  Such a gradual approach to tightening policy will 

also help mitigate the risk of undesirable spillovers abroad--including by reducing the 

risk of having to tighten more abruptly later on--and in turn promote a stronger global 

economy.
