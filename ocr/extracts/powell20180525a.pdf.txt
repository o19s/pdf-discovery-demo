Thank you for inviting me here to celebrate this important milestone.  Today is a 

special day for all of us, since the founding of the Riksbank 350 years ago marked the 

beginning of central banking.1  As we meet to discuss the challenges and opportunities 

the future may hold, it is worth pausing to note that the three and a half centuries since 

the Riksbank’s founding have seen economic growth and dynamism the breadth and 

duration of which have been unprecedented in world history.  The Swedish innovation we 

celebrate today, I believe, is a vital part of the financial foundations that support the 

continuation of rising prosperity.   

In my comments today, I will explore the road ahead for public transparency and 

accountability of central banks in a time of intense scrutiny and declining trust in public 

institutions in many places around the world.  As you know, the importance of 

transparency and accountability to monetary policymaking was recognized and became 

firmly entrenched in practice over the past few decades.  The Riksbank has been a leader 

in this transparency revolution.  Today I will focus on the less-often emphasized but 

critically important role transparency and accountability play in regulatory and financial 

stability policies.  

To preview my conclusions, public transparency and accountability around both 

financial stability and monetary policy have become all the more important in light of the 

extraordinary actions taken by central banks in response to the Global Financial Crisis.  

Financial stability policymaking has evolved from managing individual crises as they 

arise to establishing a policy framework that emphasizes prevention.  This framework 

now includes measures to increase the resiliency of the financial system; enhanced

monitoring of financial institutions and of building risks to the system; and measures, 

such as resolution planning, that require firms to take steps today to better prepare for 

future episodes of stress.  These innovations have placed special demands on 

transparency and accountability, and we have worked hard to explain them to the public.  

The framework is still evolving, and we will need to be open to making changes and to 

new ways to enhance transparency and accountability.   

Government, Central Banking, and Independence 

This is a challenging moment for central banking.  Opinion polls show that trust 

in government and public institutions is at historic lows.2  In this environment, central 

banks cannot take our measure of independence for granted.   

For monetary policy, the case for central bank independence rests on the 

demonstrated benefits of insulating monetary policy decisions from shorter-term political 

considerations.  But for a quarter century, inflation has been low and inflation 

expectations anchored.  We must not forget the lessons of the past, when a lack of central 

bank independence led to episodes of runaway inflation and subsequent economic 

contractions. 

As for financial stability, the crisis and the severe recession that followed revealed 

serious flaws at many private and public institutions, including shortcomings in 

supervision and regulation.  The crisis and its aftermath led central banks to take 

extraordinary actions, actions that challenged the ingenuity of experts in the field and 

were understandably difficult to explain and justify to a skeptical public.  While these 

actions were authorized by law and on the whole necessary to avert the complete collapse

of the financial system’s ability to service households and businesses, they may have also 

contributed to the erosion of public trust. 

Central banks are assigned narrow but important mandates.  For monetary policy, 

the Fed’s mandate is to keep inflation low and stable and to achieve maximum 

employment.  For financial sector supervision and regulation, part of our mandate is to 

foster the safety and soundness of individual institutions.  In addition, we have a 

responsibility, shared with other government agencies, to promote financial stability.  I 

view this responsibility as being highly complementary to other aspects of our mission:  

Financial stability promotes sustainable economic growth, and a stable, well-functioning 

financial system is an effective transmission channel for monetary policy.  Indeed, there 

can be no macroeconomic stability without financial stability.  

Within our narrow mandates, to safeguard against political interference, central 

banks are afforded instrument independence--that is, we are given considerable freedom 

to choose the means to achieve legislatively-assigned goals.  While the focus is often on 

monetary policy independence, research suggests that a degree of independence in 

regulatory and financial stability matters improves the stability of the banking system and 

leads to better outcomes.3  For this reason, governments in many countries, including the 

United States, have granted some institutional and budgetary independence to their 

financial regulators. 

                                                 
3 Technical implementation and oversight are two areas where instrument independence may be especially 
helpful.  See Hogue, Labonte, and Webel (2017) and the references therein.  Also, the need for some 
regulatory independence is not exclusive to the central bank; see Bernanke (2017) for a discussion.

Financial Stability, Transparency and Accountability  

In a democratic system, any degree of independence brings with it the obligation 

to provide appropriate transparency.  In turn, transparency provides an essential basis for 

accountability and democratic legitimacy by enabling effective legislative oversight and 

keeping the public informed.4  Of course, central banks also need to stick closely to our 

mandates; the case for independence weakens to the extent that central banks stray into 

issues that the legislature has not assigned to us.5 

There is also an important policy effectiveness argument in favor of transparency.  

In the financial stability arena, there is no better example of this than the role that the first 

round of stress tests played during the crisis in restoring confidence in the U.S. banking 

system.6  So in the financial stability realm, the case for enhanced transparency is not just 

about being accountable; it is also about providing credible information that can help 

restore and sustain public confidence in the financial system. 

The post-crisis regulatory system recognizes the importance of enhanced 

transparency, both about financial institutions themselves and about the processes and 

expectations of regulators and supervisors.  Before the crisis, supervision focused on the 

safety and soundness of individual institutions and was insufficiently attentive to risk in 

the financial system as a whole.  Supervisory judgments about firms were shared with the 

public only in rare and exceptional circumstances.  Financial stability tools were 

deployed after the fact, to address specific events that emerged to threaten stability.  It is 

an understatement to say that this approach proved inadequate in the crisis.

The post-crisis regime has shifted to implementing preventive policies well in 

advance of any crisis.7  Newly established ex ante policies include building the resilience 

of institutions by requiring more and higher-quality capital and liquidity buffers; a regime 

of stress tests undertaken by supervisors; and resolution planning, which requires firms to 

analyze their own potential for distress or failure and create a plan to be used in the event 

of bankruptcy.  These post-crisis policies have benefitted from public solicitation of 

feedback and in many cases from consideration in open meetings of the Board of 

Governors.   

Transparency and incorporation of public feedback in these areas have produced 

more effective supervision and regulation.  For example, transparent and clearly 

communicated policies make it easier for regulated entities to know what is expected of 

them and how best to comply.  Of course, as with any large-scale, complex undertaking, 

the standards adopted over the past decade can undoubtedly be improved.  At the Fed, we 

are committed to transparency as we assess the efficacy and efficiency of post-crisis 

reforms.   

In a sense, stress testing is itself a step forward in transparency.  Pre-crisis, 

supervisors’ views of the risks facing our most systemically important firms--and the 

firms’ ability to understand and survive these risks--were shrouded in secrecy.  Post-

crisis, as part of our stress-testing regime, these supervisory views and expectations are 

transparent.  We expect that these firms will have capital, liquidity, and risk-management 

capabilities that are adequate for the firms not only to survive, but to continue to perform 

their key functions even in the event of truly severe stress, akin to the global financial

crisis.  We make a great deal of information regarding the stress tests public, including 

the scenarios we use, portfolio-level projected losses for participating firms, and, of 

course, the results.  We have also proposed for public comment a range of ways to further 

enhance the transparency of the supervisory stress tests.  This detailed disclosure 

provides the public with a wealth of information on how these institutions would perform 

under severe stress.  And this transparency both enhances public confidence and holds 

banking regulators accountable for their judgments.   

At the Federal Reserve we use a variety of additional means to enhance public 

understanding of our supervisory and financial stability efforts and judgments.  The 

Board’s Vice Chairman for Supervision testifies before the Congress twice a year.  The 

Board staff’s assessment of financial stability is discussed four times a year at Federal 

Open Market Committee meetings, and these discussions are summarized in the 

meeting’s published minutes.  And, since 2013, the semiannual Monetary Policy Report 

to the Congress has contained a review of financial stability conditions.  

The Way Forward  

The post-crisis framework remains novel and unfamiliar.  Some of these new 

policies, such as stress testing and resolution planning, are inherently complex and 

challenging for all involved.  As a result, transparency and accountability around 

financial stability tools present particular challenges.  We will continue to strive to find 

better ways to enhance transparency around our approach to preserving financial stability.  

Efforts to engage with the public--including consumer groups, academics, and the 

financial sector--are likely to lead to improved policies.  Moreover, ongoing dialogue will 

work to enhance public trust, as well as our ability to adapt to new threats as they emerge.

There is every reason to expect that technology and communications will continue 

to rapidly evolve, and to affect the financial system and financial stability in ways that we 

cannot fully anticipate.  While future innovations may well improve the delivery of 

financial services and make the system stronger, they may also contain the seeds of 

potential future systemic vulnerabilities.  We will need to keep up with the pace of 

innovation, which will doubtless require changes to our approach to financial stability.  

As we consider such changes, it will remain critically important to provide transparency 

and accountability.  By doing so, we strengthen the foundation of democratic legitimacy 

that enables central banks to serve the needs of our citizens, in the long and proud 

tradition of the Riksbank.
