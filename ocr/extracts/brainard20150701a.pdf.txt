Recent events and commentary raise concerns about a possible deterioration in 

liquidity at times of market stress, particularly in fixed income markets.1  These concerns 

are highlighted by several episodes of unusually large intraday price movements that are 

difficult to ascribe to any particular news event, which suggest a deterioration in the 

resilience of market liquidity.  For example, on the morning of October 15, 2014, 10-year 

U.S. Treasury yields gyrated wildly, and the intraday movement in Treasury prices was 

6 standard deviations above the mean.  In addition, after 4 p.m. on March 18 EDT of this 

year, a meeting day for the Federal Open Market Committee, the U.S. dollar depreciated 

against the euro by 1.75 percent in less than three minutes, an unusually large drop in 

such a short interval.  A few weeks later, markets experienced some very large intraday 

movements in the price of German bunds during times of little market news.   

In contrast, there have been a few notable episodes where market volatility was 

clearly attributable to significant news but nonetheless appeared to evidence some 

deterioration in the resilience of liquidity.  For example, on January 15 of this year, the 

announcement by the Swiss National Bank regarding the floor of the exchange rate 

between the euro and the Swiss franc led to severe disruptions in foreign exchange 

markets.  Separately, the rise in bond yields in May and June 2013, the so-called taper 

tantrum, also appeared to many observers to have been out of proportion to the news that 

prompted it.2

A reduction in the resilience of liquidity at times of stress could be significant if it 

acted as an amplification mechanism, impeded price discovery, or interfered with market 

functioning.  For instance, during episodes of financial turmoil, reduced liquidity can lead 

to outsized liquidity premiums as well as an amplification of adverse shocks on financial 

markets, leading prices for financial assets to fall more than they otherwise would.  The 

resulting reductions in asset values could then have second-round effects, as highly 

leveraged holders of financial assets may be forced to liquidate, pushing asset prices 

down further and threatening the stability of the financial system.3   

Although anecdotes of diminished liquidity abound, statistical evidence is harder 

to come by.  Indeed, there is relatively little evidence of any deterioration in day-to-day 

liquidity.  Traditional measures of liquidity, such as bid-asked spreads, are generally no 

higher than they were pre-crisis.  Turnover, an alternative measure of day-to-day 

liquidity, is lower, but it is unclear whether this reflects changes in liquidity or perhaps 

changes in the composition of investors.  The share of bonds owned by entities that tend 

to hold securities until maturity, such as mutual funds and insurance companies, has 

increased in recent years, which would lead turnover to decline even with no change in 

market liquidity.  In some markets, the number of large trades has declined in frequency, 

which could signal reduced market depth and liquidity, but could also reflect a shift in 

market participants’ preferences toward smaller trade sizes.   

Finding a high-fidelity gauge of liquidity resilience is difficult, but there are a few 

measures that could be indicative, such as the frequency of spikes in bid-asked spreads,

limited.

the one-month relative to the three-month swaption implied volatility, the volatility of 

volatility, and the size of the tails of price-change distributions for certain assets.  We see 

some increases in the values of these indicators, which provide some evidence that 

liquidity may be less resilient than it had been previously.  But this evidence is not 

particularly robust, and, given the limitations of the existing data, it is difficult to know 

the extent to which liquidity resilience may have declined.   

As we continue to investigate quantitative evidence of the deterioration in the 

resilience of liquidity in some of the financial markets, we are also trying to tease out the 

various drivers of liquidity conditions, such as changes in regulation, trading strategies, 

and market structure.  Regulatory changes are often cited as a contributing factor.  

Trading financial assets is a balance-sheet-intensive activity, and the Dodd-Frank Act, 

has created incentives for institutions to carefully assess the risks of such activity through 

stricter requirements on leverage, liquidity, and proprietary trading, raising the cost of 

market making and possibly affecting market liquidity.  Indeed, there is evidence of 

reductions in broker-dealer bond inventories in recent years.  Nonetheless, since not all 

broker-dealer inventories are used for market-making activities, the extent to which lower 

inventories are affecting liquidity is unclear.  Moreover, reductions in broker-dealer 

inventories occurred prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, suggesting that factors 

other than regulation may also be contributing. In assessing the role of regulation as a 

possible contributor to reduced liquidity, it is important to recognize that those 

regulations were put in place to reduce the concentration of liquidity risk on the balance 

sheets of the large, highly interconnected institutions that proved to be a major amplifier 

of financial instability at the height of the crisis.

A second possible contributor may be the growing role of electronic execution of 

trades across equity, Treasury, and foreign exchange markets and the associated 

increasing role of high-frequency trading.  Competition from high-frequency trading in a 

particular market may reduce the attractiveness of that market for traditional (manual) 

traders or slower automated traders, leading to a progressive shift in the composition of 

market participants toward high-frequency traders (HFTs) over time.  This shift could be 

important to the extent that HFTs may have more limited capacity to support liquidity 

resilience since, on average, HFTs appear to trade with smaller inventories and lower 

capital than traditional traders.  Although having less inventory and capital reduces the 

cost of trading, it also means that markets increasingly dominated by HFTs may be less 

able to absorb large shocks.  Thus, liquidity may be sufficient and relatively cheap on 

normal trading days, but it may not be deep enough to prevent large price swings when 

demand for liquidity is significantly above the norm.  This consideration would be most 

relevant in the markets that are amenable to high-frequency trading, and automated 

trading more generally, where assets are fairly standardized, such as equities and U.S. 

Treasury securities, and less relevant in markets where securities are more idiosyncratic, 

such as corporate bonds.  It is also possible that markets that more readily lend 

themselves to high-speed trading may be characterized by relatively greater concentration 

over time.  Achieving the speed necessary for high-frequency trading requires large 

technology investments that necessarily may support a relatively more limited number of 

market participants.  Greater concentration in turn might be associated with lower 

resilience at times of stress. The possible effect of HFTs on the resilience of market 

liquidity is an important topic for future research.

Of course, other developments may be affecting liquidity in financial markets.  

For example, market participants have indicated that changes in participants’ risk-

management practices may be contributing to reduced market liquidity.  In particular, the 

experience of the financial crisis may have led many participants to reevaluate the risk of 

their market-making activities and either reduce their exposure to that risk, become more 

selective, or charge more for it, thereby reducing liquidity.4   

It is also worth noting the increased role of asset managers on the buy side of the 

fixed income markets.  During normal market conditions, the demand for liquidity from 

this group of bond holders is likely relatively small, since asset managers acting on behalf 

of retail investors generally buy bonds to hold them for some period.  Moreover, 

managers of open-end funds hold liquidity buffers that enable them to respond smoothly 

to normal redemption demands.  However, because the large increase in bond fund 

holdings is relatively recent, little is known about how these funds will react to periods of 

market stress or to abrupt changes in financial conditions and the adequacy of their 

liquidity buffers for such situations.  Because funds potentially allow daily redemptions 

even against illiquid assets, it is possible that redemptions could be magnified in stressed 

conditions as individuals try to redeem early, which in turn could lead to liquidations of 

relatively less liquid assets, thereby amplifying price volatility and reducing market 

liquidity.   

If in fact liquidity resilience has declined recently, it may be a transitional 

development that will be corrected going forward as participants adjust their risk 

                                                 
4 Another potentially important change in markets has been the increased prevalence of dark pools or 
proprietary trading sites housed inside broker-dealers, which provide no information to the public about the 
volume or prices of trades.  It is possible this activity might be changing price discovery, although there is 
debate over the net effect.

management practices, and the structure of these markets continues to evolve.  For 

example, if traditional providers of liquidity scale back their activity in response to 

changes in regulation and market structure, over time, this shift may create incentives for 

other providers, which are not similarly constrained, to step in.   

Stress tests, such as those announced by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

(SEC) offer one way to help ensure that market participants are prepared for sharper 

spikes in market volatility.  For instance, in the Federal Reserve Board’s most recent 

stress test, the severely adverse scenario featured a large decrease in the prices of 

corporate bonds.   

We are in the early stages of data-based analysis of possible recent changes in the 

resilience of market liquidity.  An upcoming study of the October 15 event will shine 

some light on the functioning of the U.S. Treasury market, but there is still much we need 

to learn.  More broadly, at the Board, we will closely monitor and investigate the extent 

of changes in the resilience of liquidity in important markets, while deepening our 

understanding of different contributors and how market participants are adapting.
