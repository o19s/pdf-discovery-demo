Opening Remarks  

by 

Daniel K. Tarullo 

Member  

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act Outreach Meeting 

Boston, Massachusetts 

 May 4, 2015 




 On behalf of the Federal Reserve System, I want to thank you for attending this third in a 

series of outreach meetings being held as part of the interagency review process under the 

Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA).  I would also like to 

extend my thanks to President Rosengren and the staff of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston for 

hosting today’s meeting.  

 As you know, EGRPRA requires that regulations applicable to insured depository 

institutions be reviewed every 10 years.  Our outreach meetings are designed to hear your 

comments and suggestions for reducing regulatory burden on insured depository institutions.  

While the EGRPRA review aims to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome 

regulations as they apply to all insured depository institutions, we are especially focused on the 

burden imposed on smaller depository institutions.  I look forward to hearing your views both on 

issues that have been prominent in the first two EGRPRA meetings--including capital regulation, 

reporting requirements, appraisal rules, and examination frequency--and on matters that have not 

yet received significant attention. 

In our joint rulemakings, the federal banking agencies have tried, wherever possible, to 

tailor our rules for different sizes of depository institutions and to reduce unnecessary burden on 

community banks.  We hope to use the information gained during these meetings and other 

outreach efforts to, among other things, make this tiering of regulations more comprehensive. 

Having just inherited the chairmanship of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination 

Council (FFIEC) from Comptroller Curry, I hope to help make the decennial EGRPRA review a 

productive one.  All of us on the FFIEC are committed to ensuring that this is not a formalistic 

bureaucratic exercise.  To me, a productive EGRPRA exercise will be one that results in changes 

in regulations and supervisory practices that yields significant reduction in regulatory burden,

especially for smaller banks while still promoting the safety and soundness of insured depository 

institutions, and protecting both the federal deposit insurance fund and financial stability.
