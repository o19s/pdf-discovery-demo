The financial crisis revealed important weaknesses in many areas of our financial 

system.  In response, governments around the world have undertaken a variety of far-

reaching regulatory reforms that, I would argue, can be grouped into three categories:  

those intended to strengthen institutions; those aimed at strengthening financial markets; 

and those that take steps to reinforce and, in some cases, build new market 

infrastructures. 

The reform effort seeks to address each of these areas in a comprehensive manner 

that recognizes the interplay among them.  For instance, enhanced capital and liquidity 

regulations will strengthen the ability of financial institutions to withstand both credit 

losses and liquidity shocks.  Stronger financial institutions, along with enhanced risk 

management and supervision, will strengthen market infrastructures.  And new rules to 

improve the functioning of markets, such as those that require greater transparency of 

over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets through trade repositories and swap 

execution facilities, will strengthen financial institutions and infrastructures alike.  

Moreover, greater post-trade transparency will improve competition and make it easier 

for market participants to make informed choices about which OTC derivatives are best 

suited to their needs. 

Today I will focus on the third aspect of this effort--reforms intended to 

strengthen financial market infrastructures.  Specifically, I will look at measures to 

improve the clearing of OTC derivatives through the expanded use of central 

counterparties (CCPs) and the introduction of margin requirements for those OTC 

derivatives that remain bilateral.  In the United States, several agencies are working 

together to implement these reforms.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission

(CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are responsible for 

establishing the regulatory regime for and supervising CCPs as well as determining 

which swaps must be centrally cleared.  The Federal Reserve and six other agencies are 

responsible for establishing margin requirements for derivatives that are not cleared 

through a CCP. 1  The Federal Reserve shares with the other members of the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) an interest in CCP regulation and central clearing 

from a broader financial stability perspective.  The Fed also plays a role in supervising 

financial market utilities that are designated as systemically important under Title VIII of 

the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank).       

The financial crisis involved significant failures in the functioning, regulation, and 

supervision of OTC derivatives markets.  These failures were well illustrated by the 

widespread and destabilizing effects of large losses by American International Group 

(AIG) on its OTC structured finance and credit derivative positions.  In the absence of 

government intervention, AIG’s failure would have exposed its counterparties to 

significant losses at a time of widespread financial stress.  Further, the lack of 

transparency in OTC derivatives markets at that time led to a wave of uncertainty about 

who was exposed to AIG and the extent of that exposure.  This fundamental lack of 

information fueled concerns about potential losses and drove a cycle of escalating 

pressure on large financial institutions around the globe.  Government intervention was 

deemed necessary to stop this cycle and contain the threat to the financial system.  AIG’s 

failure revealed systemic problems in the OTC derivatives market that went well beyond 

the failure of a single market participant.

establishing margin requirements on derivatives that are not cleared through a CCP.

The Group of Twenty governments responded by committing that all standardized 

derivatives would be moved to central clearing and that derivatives that are not centrally 

cleared would be subject to margin requirements.2  Progress has been made on both of 

these fronts.  Since credit default swaps clearing was introduced in 2009, the notional 

value of cleared credit derivatives has grown to more than $6 trillion.  The notional value 

of interest rate swaps that are centrally cleared has more than doubled since 2009 and 

now stands at more than $400 trillion.3  These amounts will surely increase further in the 

coming years.  And international standards on margin requirements for derivatives that 

are not centrally cleared have recently been finalized.4  I would like to briefly discuss 

how these reform efforts are intended to reduce systemic risks and offer my views on 

how to ensure that they are effectively implemented. 

The Enhanced Role of Central Counterparties in OTC Derivatives Markets  

By design, central clearing offers important advantages over a bilateral market 

structure in which no participant can know the full extent of its counterparties’ risk 

exposures.  The hub-and-spoke structure of central clearing enables the netting of gains 

and losses across multiple market participants, which has the potential to significantly 

reduce each participant’s aggregate counterparty risk exposure.  Central clearing can also

improve transparency, which is important in reducing incentives for market participants 

to pull away from other institutions in times of stress.  Rather than trying to assess its 

exposure to all of its trading partners, a market participant would need to manage only its 

exposure to the central counterparty.  And CCPs can also reduce risk by imposing more 

effective risk controls on clearing members.  Since their origins in the 19th century, CCPs 

have evolved significantly, and that evolution has allowed them to survive and continue 

functioning through many crises, including the most recent one.5 

Of course, the other side of this coin is that concentrating risk in a central 

counterparty could create a single point of failure for the entire system.  Given their 

heightened prominence in the financial infrastructure, if CCPs are to mitigate systemic 

risks they must hold themselves to--and be held to--the highest standards of risk 

management.  In many respects, CCPs are the collective reflection of the financial 

institutions that are their members and the markets that they support.  The credit and 

liquidity risks borne by a CCP arise from the clearing activities of its members.  Those 

risks materialize when a clearing member defaults.  Most of the financial resources to 

cover risk exposures will come from a CCP’s members.  And a member’s default will 

require the CCP to work with surviving members in the context of prevailing market 

conditions.  CCPs play a critical role in ensuring a robust risk management regime that 

fully takes account of this interplay among markets, institutions, and infrastructure.  

Regulators, clearing members, and their clients also must be engaged in making sure

CCPs are safe and effective at managing the risks, interactions, and interdependencies 

inherent in the clearing process. 

I will now turn to some key aspects of the regulatory framework for CCPs that 

will strengthen the financial system and help reduce systemic risk. 

Three Keys to Ensuring Central Counterparties Are Effective in Mitigating 

Systemic Risks 

There are three key dimensions to making the reform program work in practice:  

enhancing supervision and regulation of CCPs, strengthening CCP risk management and 

governance, and promoting the stability of clearing members. 

Enhancing Central Counterparty Supervision and Regulation 

The decision to require central clearing of standardized derivatives as a 

foundation for reform has raised the stakes for CCPs, clearing members, regulators, and 

the general public.  At the international level, financial regulatory authorities addressed 

this challenge by updating, harmonizing, and strengthening the minimum risk 

management standards applied to financial market infrastructures, including CCPs.  The 

new Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures, commonly referred to as the PFMIs, 

set a higher bar for risk management to strengthen these core market infrastructures and 

promote financial stability.6  Just last week, the CFTC finalized its adoption of the PFMIs 

for the derivatives clearing organizations it regulates and supervises.7 

The PFMIs require that a CCP develop strategies to cover its losses and continue 

operating in a time of widespread financial stress.  In particular, the PFMIs require that a

CCP maintain financial resources sufficient to cover its current and potential future 

exposures to each participant fully with a high degree of confidence.  CCPs must 

maintain additional resources to cover the failure of the clearing member with the largest 

exposure under extreme but plausible market conditions.  In the case of CCPs with more 

complex risk profiles or those that are systemically important in multiple jurisdictions, 

the CCP must have adequate resources to handle the failure of the two clearing members 

with the largest exposures.  Finally, the PFMIs require a CCP to identify scenarios that 

may potentially prevent it from being able to continue operations, including so-called 

end-of-default waterfall issues, and develop detailed plans for recovery or orderly wind-

down.  Regulators and industry groups are working to establish minimum expectations 

for CCP transparency of both qualitative and quantitative information that will allow key 

stakeholders to assess a CCP’s risk management.8   

This international strategy for strengthening CCPs has been complemented by 

several domestic initiatives to introduce regulatory frameworks for OTC derivatives and 

to enhance supervision of systemically important CCPs.  The two most notable 

developments are the passage of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation and 

Dodd-Frank, notably titles VII and VIII.  Both laws establish a framework for reporting, 

regulating, and clearing OTC derivatives transactions; call for international coordination; 

and emphasize enhanced risk management standards for CCPs.  Differences of

implementation have emerged, however, and it will be important to engage with other 

governments to ensure that such differences do not lead to regulatory arbitrage or 

weakened standards. 

Central Counterparty Risk Management and Governance 

The two primary risks facing a CCP are credit risk (the potential for the CCP to 

incur losses after it closes out a defaulter’s positions) and liquidity risk (the possibility 

that a CCP will not have sufficient cash on hand to meet its payment obligations in a 

timely manner).  While credit risk and liquidity risk are interrelated, they are also distinct 

and need to be measured and managed separately. 

To promote sound credit risk management, the PFMIs require that a CCP collect 

variation margin from its members to limit the buildup of current exposures.  In addition, 

CCPs must also calculate and collect initial margin sufficient to cover potential changes 

in the value of each participant’s position between the last collection of variation margin 

and the final closeout of a participant’s position should it default to the CCP.  This 

process involves modeling potential price movements with an appropriate confidence 

threshold, determining the closeout period in the event the participant defaults, and 

numerous other factors.  Given the complexity of this modeling, it is important that CCPs 

rigorously back-test and stress-test the adequacy of their margin models under a wide 

range of extreme yet plausible scenarios.  More broadly, a CCP should test the 

sufficiency of its total financial resources--initial margin, default funds and capital--to 

cover potential credit losses, taking into account evolving market volatility and liquidity 

conditions. 


 - 8 -

An important lesson from the financial crisis is that liquidity is extremely 

important in ensuring ongoing viability and resilience during a period of financial stress.  

No amount of resources can guarantee that a CCP will be able to meet its payment and 

settlement obligations, unless those resources can be converted to cash with certainty and 

within a very short time frame.  CCP liquidity is especially important, since a failure to 

meet required payment obligations could undermine market confidence at precisely the 

moment when it is most fragile and trigger run-like behavior as financial institutions seek 

to reduce their exposure to the CCP and its members. 

To measure and manage its liquidity risks, the PFMIs require a CCP to have 

effective methodologies to estimate its funding exposures under a variety of stressed 

conditions, to identify available cash resources, and to establish mechanisms for 

converting its noncash collateral to cash.  The need to assure adequate liquidity presents a 

number of challenges.  CCPs will need to mobilize cash within a matter of hours on the 

day of a large clearing member’s default.  Cash balances on deposit at a bank can be 

quickly accessed, but CCPs often put their cash resources in overnight investments to 

earn a return.  The nature and mechanics of such investments, as well as prevailing 

market conditions, can critically affect the ability of a CCP to unwind those investments 

quickly enough to meet its cash needs.  A similar challenge will arise with the need to 

convert noncash collateral, such as initial margin collateral, to cash.  The PFMIs require 

CCPs to have in place prearranged and highly reliable funding sources to address this 

need. 

Managing credit and liquidity risks requires effective governance.  One important 

aspect of CCP governance is a commitment to transparency.  Clearing members bear 


 - 9 -

primary responsibility for understanding the risks associated with participating in a CCP, 

including their potential exposures in the event of a default.  This will require the CCP to 

provide relevant and even firm-specific information to facilitate the members’ analysis.  

Clearing members and their clients, regulators, and the broader public require 

transparency so that they can assess the adequacy of a CCP’s risk management and its 

overall risk profile. 

Promoting the Stability of Central Counterparty Members 

So far, I have focused on CCPs.  Now I would like to turn to the critical role 

played by clearing members of those CCPs.  A CCP ultimately draws its strength and 

resilience from that of its members.  And it is not a one-way street, since strong CCPs 

enable clearing members and their clients to significantly reduce their exposure to 

counterparty credit risk.  Effective risk management by both a CCP and its clearing 

members need to work in concert.  

As a general matter, enhanced capital and liquidity requirements have 

substantially improved the overall risk position of the banks that constitute many of the 

major clearing members.  For example, Tier 1 common equity capital ratios at the largest 

U.S. banks have nearly doubled since 2007.9  In addition, new requirements address the 

specific interactions that banks have with CCPs and derivatives markets in order to 

promote both the use of central clearing and strong CCP risk management. 

Under Basel III, capital requirements for bank exposures to a CCP are sensitive to 

the risk management standards applied by the CCP.  These requirements acknowledge 

                                                 
9 The Tier 1 common equity ratio for the 18 largest bank holding companies increased from 5.9 percent in 
December of 2007 to 11.3 percent in September of 2013.  For more information, see the FR Y-9C

that CCPs that adhere to the PFMIs present lower risks to their members.  Exposures to 

such qualifying CCPs require less capital.10  The capital rules also recognize that a CCP 

requiring more initial margin from its members exposes those members to less default 

risk, and therefore require less capital.  On the liquidity front, the recently proposed 

liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) recognizes the liquidity-intensive nature of derivatives 

transactions.  Under the LCR, a bank is required to maintain high-quality liquid assets 

that are sufficient to withstand an extreme yet plausible margin call from its derivatives 

counterparties.11  Importantly, the liquidity requirement depends on the member’s net 

derivatives position with the CCP--if the position is hedged, the liquidity requirement 

will be appropriately attenuated.   

Ensuring the Stability of OTC Derivatives Markets That Are Not Centrally 

Cleared:  Margin Requirements for Noncleared Derivatives 

While central clearing is important and is expected to increase substantially over 

time, a significant portion of nonstandardized, bespoke derivatives will never be suitable 

for central clearing.  This bilaterally cleared part of the market was a principal source of 

systemic risk during the crisis.  For noncentrally cleared derivatives, margin requirements 

will serve as the main tool to mitigate systemic risks.  The Basel Committee on Banking 

Supervision (Basel Committee) and the International Organization of Securities 

Commissions (IOSCO) have recently finalized a framework for margin requirements on 

noncentrally cleared derivatives that provides for harmonized rules and a level playing

field, which is important given the global nature of derivatives markets.  Regulatory 

authorities in participating countries are now in the process of developing margin rules 

for noncleared derivatives in light of the international framework.     

The framework requires both financial firms and systemically important 

nonfinancial firms that trade derivatives to collect both variation margin and initial 

margin, as is the case for centrally cleared derivatives.  The initial margin requirements 

represent a significant change to existing market practice and will undoubtedly impose 

some costs on market participants.  As originally proposed, the new framework would 

have required most market participants to collect initial margin from the first dollar of 

exposure.  The International Swap Dealers Association estimated that roughly an 

additional $1.7 trillion in initial margin would have been required globally.12  In light of 

this concern, the framework was released for public consultation on two separate 

occasions and the Basel Committee and IOSCO conducted a detailed impact study to 

determine the potential liquidity costs of the new requirements.13 

The final version of the framework addressed these concerns by allowing firms to 

begin collecting initial margin only as potential future credit exposures rise above 

$65 million for a particular counterparty.  According to the impact study, this revision 

reduced the estimated global liquidity requirement from roughly $2.3 trillion to 

$900 billion.14  The result is a margin regime that will protect the financial system from

the largest and most systemic exposures while also reducing overall liquidity costs and 

providing relief to smaller derivatives market participants. 

It should also be noted that these margin requirements are new to the market and 

their effects cannot be fully understood before they become effective.  There is simply no 

substitute for experience.  Accordingly, the Basel Committee and IOSCO have 

established a monitoring group that will evaluate the effects of the margin requirements.  

The evaluation will focus on the consistency of the margin standards with related 

regulatory initiatives such as the implementation of the LCR and potential minimum 

haircuts on repurchase transactions.  Based on the findings of this monitoring group, the 

Basel Committee and IOSCO will jointly determine whether any modifications to the 

margin requirements are necessary or appropriate.  In this way, regulators are taking an 

experience-based approach to managing systemic risk that looks across the combined 

effect of a number of related regulatory initiatives. 

Conclusion 

The financial crisis revealed significant flaws in the structure of the OTC 

derivatives markets that are now being addressed as part of a worldwide reform effort.  

Increased central clearing and margins for noncleared derivatives are foundational 

elements of the program.  Together, these reforms can help create a system in which the 

OTC derivatives market infrastructure acts as a pillar of strength in the next crisis.  To 

achieve this goal, it is imperative that international standards such as the PFMIs and the 

margining framework for noncentrally cleared derivatives be forcefully and consistently 

implemented across the globe. 


 - 13 -

Implementation of the new framework will present some real-world challenges.  

National rules still need to be written, including rules for margin requirements on 

noncentrally cleared derivatives.  These national rules will need to deal with local legal 

regimes and markets, yet also be internationally consistent to ensure a level playing field.  

More broadly, international cooperation will be needed to ensure that the new framework 

works in practice.
