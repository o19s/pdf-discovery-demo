performed that type of diligence with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, 

and the risk-free rates identified in other jurisdictions.  That effort has been a clear and 

positive example of public-private sector cooperation.  These alternative risk-free rates 

have been created or substantially reformed to ensure that robust, transaction-based rates 

that accurately represent well-defined underlying markets and are consistent with 

internationally-recognized standards are available.   

I want to thank the many institutions here today, and the many more that have 

played equally constructive roles, for their efforts in this process.  This month marks the 

one-year anniversary of SOFR and is close to the one-year anniversary of the other new 

risk-free rates.  Over that year, we have seen the establishment of new futures markets, 

cleared swap markets, and debt markets based on these new rates.  SOFR futures, which 

did not exist a year ago, have seen more than $7 trillion in cumulative notional volumes.  

This has been a crucial development for market liquidity and is helping to spur the 

growth of SOFR swaps and other derivative markets.  And SOFR is being used in cash 

products, with $81 billion in SOFR-linked debt issued over the past year.   

New markets do not arise overnight--in normal circumstances they can often take 

decades to develop.  What has been accomplished over the past year is remarkable.  At 

the same time, we have only a little over two and a half years until the point at which 

LIBOR could end, and the transition needs to continue to accelerate.  The private sector 

needs to take on this responsibility, and we expect you to do so.  The Federal Reserve’s 

supervisory teams are including the transition away from LIBOR in their monitoring 

discussions with large firms.  The Federal Reserve will expect to see an appropriate level 

of preparedness at the banks it supervises.  As the Alternative Reference Rates
