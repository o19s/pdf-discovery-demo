Opening Remarks 

 by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at  


“Regulation of Systemic Risk,” a conference cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Board 

and the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking 


Washington, D.C. 



September 15, 2011 


 Distinguished guests, I would like to welcome you to this conference on the 

“Regulation of Systemic Risk,” which is jointly sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board 

and the Journal of Money, Credit and Banking.

  It is the fourth conference in a series 

that was initiated in 2005 and is held every two years.  These conferences support 

original research on topics that are highly relevant for the Federal Reserve’s public policy 

mission.  Conference proceedings are subsequently published in special issues of the 

journal and disseminated to researchers at central banks and academic institutions 

worldwide.  

 While the previous three conferences focused on monetary policy issues, the 

papers presented at this conference relate to the Federal Reserve’s duty to maintain 

financial stability and contain systemic risk.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act now requires the Federal Reserve to take a macroprudential 

approach to financial regulation--that is, to consider the health of the financial system as 

well as the health of individual firms and markets. 

 The recent financial crisis has spurred a great deal of research on its causes and, 

more broadly, on the topic of systemic risk and its regulation.  This research is of critical 

importance.  It can inform the design and implementation of macroprudential regulations 

and policies, and I suspect no one in this audience needs to be convinced that we must get 

this right.  The nine papers at this conference make a variety of welcome contributions in 

this area.  Two focus on an important aspect of the recent financial crisis--namely, the

rise and fall of mortgage securitization and associated swings in real estate lending.

Other papers study the causes and indicators of systemic risk more generally and look at 

how well macroprudential regulations and policies can address those causes.

  Finally, 

several papers examine specific regulations from a macroprudential perspective, 

including capital requirements and risk retention rules for securitization.

 The discussants’ remarks, the general discussions, and the policy panel will surely 

be very helpful in identifying fruitful directions for further research.  I welcome you to 

the Federal Reserve and wish you a stimulating and productive conference.
