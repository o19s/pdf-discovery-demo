Let me begin by thanking the Bank for International Settlements and Agustín Carstens 

for the invitation to join you today.  In considering venues for my inaugural speech as chair of 

the Financial Stability Board (FSB), I found this particular opportunity quite fitting.  It is an 

honor to be here, in Hong Kong, with colleagues from around the world, representing central 

banks who are committed to advancing financial stability not only in their home countries but 

also globally. 

I would like to discuss with you tonight my view of how the work of the FSB must 

evolve, and some key principles that I think should inform that work.  My predecessor, Bank of 

England Governor Mark Carney, guided the FSB for the last seven years along a path that was 

formidably challenging.  The Global Financial Crisis had exposed fault lines in the financial 

system that had to be addressed immediately, comprehensively, and vigorously.  The body of 

post-crisis regulation that has resulted, though it involved the energy and efforts of a 

kaleidoscopically varied host of standard setters, regulators, and central banks--including all the 

institutions in this room--was nonetheless accomplished under the aegis and at the instigation of 

the FSB.  It was a tour de force of orchestration, and it has unquestionably made the financial 

system safer and more resilient. 

Today, however, the post-crisis reform agenda has been largely completed.  Basel III is 

final, the largest global banks have substantially more capital and liquidity, over-the-counter 

derivatives markets are safer, and steps have been taken to address the risks of too-big-to-to fail 

institutions.  Through greater monitoring and policy measures, the FSB is addressing risks from 

non-bank financial intermediation.  And there has been remarkable progress on the difficult and 

unsung task of establishing workable resolution regimes that are consistent with the FSB’s 

clearly defined principles.

Yes, we all have work to do to ensure full, timely, and consitent implementation of the 

agreed reforms, and, yes, we will do that work, but, it is time for the FSB to turn more of its 

energy and attention to the future.  Tonight I would like to outline a few core principles that 

should guide this pivot forward.  First, engagement:  to maintain the legitimacy of our work, to 

increase understanding of it, and to enhance its effectiveness, we must improve our outreach and 

transparency--including to our membership, other global authorities, the public, and key 

stakeholders.  Second, rigor:  as we devote more attention to evaluation of new and evolving 

risks in the financial sector, we must ensure that our assessment of vulnerabilities is based on 

cutting-edge thinking and a disciplined methodology.  And third, analysis:  regulation has 

evolved rapidly in the last decade, and--if we are doing our jobs right--will continue to evolve 

with rapid developments in the financial sector.  An important part of our work must be 

continual, critical analysis of the effects of regulaton with an eye to making useful improvements 

where possible. 

Engagement:  Outreach and Transparency 

Let me begin with the principle of engagement, and let me lay the groundwork for this 

discussion by reviewing the way the FSB was established and its mandate, to see how we can 

continue to fulfill that mandate going forward.  As we all know, the FSB was born out of the 

crucible of the 2007-09 Global Financial Crisis--a crisis that demonstrated in the starkest 

possible way the importance of global financial stability to the well-being of families and 

businesses around the world.  In the months following the peak of the crisis, the world was 

struggling with financial market turmoil, and the resultant macroeconomic effects were felt by 

people everywhere around the world.  It was clear that the response to this crisis needed to be 

global, and the G7 and G10, without any emerging market representation, were not the right 


- 3 - 
 

bodies to organize a global response.  As such, the Heads of State and Government of the G20 

called for the Financial Stability Forum (FSF), a relatively small and unmuscular group, to 

expand its membership and to strengthen its institutional framework.  The result was the 

Financial Stability Board, which was designed as a mechanism for national authorities, global 

standards-setting bodies, and international authorities to identify and address vulnerabilities in 

the global financial system and to develop stronger regulatory and supervisory policies to create 

a more resilient global financial system.  This new group is more representative of the 

interconnected global economy and financial system and can more effectively mobilize to 

promote global financial stability than anything that existed before.  Whereas the FSF included 

only 11 jurisdictions (all of which were advanced economies), the FSB includes 24 jurisdictions 

and 73 representatives, which include all the members of the G20 and of which 10 are emerging 

market economies. 

In fostering global financial stability, the actions of the FSB have the potential to affect 

the global economy and financial system in important ways.  Success in promoting global 

financial stability should benefit everybody, through more sustainable and stronger economic 

growth.  At the same time, financial stability policy will also affect institutions and markets 

beyond the FSB’s membership.  Recognizing the wide-reaching effects of its work, the FSB 

must seek input from a broad range of stakeholders, each of whom brings a different perspective 

to the issues under consideration.  While we are directly accountable to the G20, we are, through 

the G20, accountable to all of the people affected by our actions.  In my view, that means we 

must engage in genuine, substantial dialogue with all of these stakeholders, to a greater and more 

effective degree than we have in the past.

Let me take an example that may be of particular relevance to many of you here tonight:  

our Regional Consultative Groups or RCGs.  These are six groups around the globe--the 

Americas, Europe, the Middle East and North Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa, the Commonwealth of 

Independent States, and Asia--that bring together FSB members with about 70 additional 

jurisdictions.  These groups help the FSB get broader input into its policy development and 

improve our outreach efforts.  Each RCG meets once or twice a year to discuss policy 

development, regional and global financial vulnerabilities, and other current topics of particular 

interest to the respective region.  For instance, topics discussed at the last meeting in Asia 

included capital flow volatility, cyber resilience of financial institutions, and fintech.  

These RCGs are great in concept, but they have struggled in practice.  We have already 

begun a study to look back at how the RCGs have operated since their creation in 2011, how 

they interact with the FSB, and what best practices have been learned.  Even while that study is 

underway, I am committed to improving our mechanisms for reaching out to countries outside 

the FSB for genuine learning about the effects of FSB actions.  I plan to attend a number of RCG 

meetings each year because of the importance I place on making sure these groups are truly 

useful tools, and we will improve these vital conduits of two-way information in order to 

improve our effectiveness and our transparency. 

While the RCGs may be of particular interest to some here tonight, they are just the tip of 

the iceberg for what we have to do to improve our engagement and outreach.  Because the FSB’s 

authority is ultimately derived from the people and from the political power given to authorities 

in their countries, we have a responsibility to seek input from and to provide information about 

our deliberations and actions to the broader public.  To that end, for the first time in the FSB’s 


- 5 - 
 

history, we will shortly publish our work program to the public to provide people with a full 

picture of the issues we are investigating over the coming year. 

Finally, there are the businesses, institutions, and market participants that are directly 

affected by the policy recommendations of the FSB.  We currently engage with those entities to 

gather information as we consider recommendations to the G20.  For example, we have in the 

past conducted public consultations on FSB policy recommendations--but often on a very short 

timetable, which limits the ability for true exchange.  We have now established an expectation 

that the public consultation period will be at least 60 days.  The key point is that when it comes 

to outreach to inform our work and transparency in the communication of it, we must do more, 

and more eagerly. 

This discussion of engagement, outreach and transparency may seem like an odd place to 

begin a “vision” speech, but I think it is foundational.  The FSB must maintain its legitimacy in 

order to be effective, and to do that we have to work hard to hear from all relevant parties when 

deliberating.  What’s more, we have to do so publicly and methodically.  Everyone around the 

world should understand that we only make recommendations once we have gathered and 

considered all points of view.  Process is important, and good process leads to good substance. 

Assessing Financial Stability 

With that said, let me turn to the core piece of the FSB’s mission--assessing and 

mitigating vulnerabilities, especially in the nonbank sector.  The FSB’s work has a natural flow.  

We strive to identify vulnerabilities in the financial system that could threaten financial stability 

when a shock hits.  When a vulnerability has been identified, we examine possible policy 

responses.  If a policy is recommended to the G20 and adopted, we then monitor the 


- 6 - 
 

implementation of that recommendation globally.  Finally, when enough time has passed for the 

enacted policies to have had measurable effects, we study those effects. 

For much of the post-crisis period, our focus was on developing policy recommendations 

to address vulnerabilities made apparent by the crisis.  Now, however, with nearly all of the post-

crisis reform agenda complete, the FSB needs to put more of our resources into identifying new 

vulnerabilities in a financial sector that continues to evolve and to studying the effects of the 

many reforms that have been enacted.  Let me start by discussing vulnerability assessment. 

The reforms that have been implemented over the past decade have changed the financial 

system for the better.  However, that does not mean we are immune from future financial crises.  

It means that we have boosted the financial system’s resilience to some of the types of shocks 

and vulnerabilities that precipitated the crisis.  To be sure, some of these measures, like higher 

bank capital and liquidity requirements, after effective against a wide range of shocks.  However, 

we cannot be complacent and assume that we are safe from all shocks.  As a result, the FSB has 

decided to undertake a review of its framework for assessing vulnerabilities to ensure that we are 

at the cutting edge of financial stability vulnerability assessment. 

This work will be undertaken by our committee charged with assessing vulnerabilities 

under the leadership of FSB Vice Chair Klaas Knot of the Dutch National Bank (De 

Nederlandsche Bank).  This should be a framework that starts from first principles and benefits 

from substantial dialogue with nonbanks as well as banks, regulators, and other relevant official 

bodies.  There is a lot that we can draw on.  The crisis led to an explosion of work in this area 

aimed at improving the ability of authorities to identify financial vulnerabilities in order to be 

able to take appropriate action in a timely fashion.  I trust that the framework will harness the 

strength of the broad and diverse membership of the FSB, that it will be forward looking, and 


- 7 - 
 

that it will be flexible enough to handle a financial system that will continue to evolve over time.  

This will not be easy--developments like the emergence of crypto-assets may challenge any 

framework--but that makes the goal of a robust framework all the more important.  

Evaluating the Effects of Reform 

Finally, let me turn to the FSB’s evaluation of the effects of reforms that have been 

implemented.  In the past few years, we have reached a point where many of the reforms have 

been in place for long enough to have effects that we can measure and analyze.  For those 

reforms, we need to ask several key questions.  First, to what extent are those reforms having the 

intended effects and building a more resilient financial system?  Second, have those reforms had 

any unintended, adverse effects that we can address?  These first two questions are, perhaps, 

apparent.  We should also ask a third question, however, that is equally important:  can we 

achieve a strong level of financial resilience with reforms that are more efficient, simple, 

transparent, and tailored?  If so, we owe it to everyone affected by the policies recommended by 

the FSB to try, because there is a strong public interest in the efficiency of the financial sector, 

just as there is in its safety and soundness.  If reforms are unnecessarily burdensome and we can 

achieve strong resiliency more efficiently and simply, we should be able to boost sustainable 

financial and economic activity, thus benefitting everyone.  

Evaluating reforms in light of these questions requires rigor--in terms of the selection of 

evaluation topics, the choice of analytical methods, the assessment of effects, and the 

development of policy conclusions.  This rigor is critical for the quality and credibility of the 

evaluation work.  For this reason, the FSB developed a clear Evaluation Framework, under 

which the evaluations are based, as much as possible, on quantitative data to measure the costs 

and benefits of reforms.  Equally critical to a successful review is a truly open mindset with 


- 8 - 
 

which to evaluate the relevant data.  One public measure of whether we are doing this review 

process well will be whether we recommend any improvements or revisions on the basis of it.  In 

any system as complex and consequential as the body of post-crisis financial regulations, there 

will always be aspects--and sometimes material aspects--that can be improved on the basis of 

experience and analysis.  A credible review process that is both rigorous and dispassionate will 

find a few. 

Last year, the FSB completed the first two evaluations under its framework, of the effects 

of reform on infrastructure fin ance and the clearing of derivative contracts.  We are currently 

engaged in work examining the effects of reforms on the financing of small and medium 

enterprises, which are the lifeblood of many of the world’s economies.  We will consult publicly 

on the findings of this evaluation in June, ahead of the G20 Summit in Osaka.  And we are in the 

process of launching an important study on the effects of reforms aimed at ending too big to fail. 

This evaluation is being led by Claudia Buch, vice president of the Deutsche Bundesbank.  

Conclusion 

 This is an important time for the FSB.  We are nearing completion of the post-crisis 

reform agenda, a major accomplishment.  With that comes the opportunity to turn our focus to 

ways in which we can improve the FSB and prepare it for the next phase of its existence.  We 

will work diligently to enhance our transparency and to expand our efforts to reach out to as 

many stakeholders as possible.  We will prepare for the next crisis by making sure that our 

framework to assess vulnerabilities to financial stability is state of the art and remains so going 

forward.  And, we will work hard to maintain the important reforms in place, ensure they are 

working as intended, and, where possible, improve them.
