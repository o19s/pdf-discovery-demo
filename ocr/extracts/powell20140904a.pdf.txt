Thank you for giving me this opportunity to speak this evening.  I would like to 

discuss ongoing efforts to reform the current structure and uses of the London Interbank 

Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR.  These reforms affect not only the 

financial industry, but also a large number of U.S. households and corporations.   

LIBOR is a reference rate.  When two parties enter a financial contract in which 

interest payments are to be exchanged, they frequently choose to base those payments on 

LIBOR.  LIBOR is currently referenced in roughly $300 trillion worth of contracts 

globally, which means that it is part of the global financial system’s critical 

infrastructure.1  But LIBOR’s credibility was badly undermined by the scandal that 

erupted when some of the banks that help produce the rate attempted to manipulate it by 

contributing inaccurate estimates of their borrowing costs.  These illegal actions helped 

damage the public’s trust not just in LIBOR, but also in financial markets and institutions 

more broadly.   

In response, a number of global efforts to reform reference rates have been 

undertaken.  LIBOR is produced and administered in London.  As a result of the steps 

taken by the government of the United Kingdom, LIBOR is now regulated and 

supervised by the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).  The International 

Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) developed a broad set of 19 principles 

that reference rates and other financial benchmarks are now expected to meet.2  Building 

on this work, in July, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) released a report outlining a

number of further reform proposals.3  Continuing the work of my former Fed colleague 

Jeremy Stein, I recently took over as co-chair--along with Martin Wheatley, chief 

executive officer of the FCA--of the international group that drafted the report and is now 

charged with implementing its recommendations.4  Today I will discuss the reasons why 

further reforms are necessary and how those reforms should proceed, and I will focus on 

U.S. dollar LIBOR.5  As is made clear in the FSB report, while the goals and principles 

of the official sector participants are uniform, specific plans for reference rate reform will 

vary by currency, depending on differences in markets and institutions. 

I will share my conclusion at the outset.  While there have been significant 

reforms, much remains to be done.6  First, U.S. dollar LIBOR needs to be updated to 

reflect current practices in unsecured funding markets and to be better anchored in actual 

transactions.  Second, and equally important, regulators need to work with market 

participants to encourage them to develop and adopt alternative reference rates that better 

reflect the current structure of U.S. financial markets, in which borrowing and derivatives 

transactions are much more likely to be secured with collateral.  Going forward, these 

alternative rates could replace LIBOR as the reference rate for new interest rate 

derivatives and some other contracts denominated in U.S. dollars.  These dual transitions 

will need to be managed very carefully to avoid disrupting the financing markets on 

which borrowers and lenders depend.  But I believe that they are crucial to strengthening 

the stability of our financial system and to helping restore the public’s faith in its

integrity.  This problem is not just Wall Street’s concern; every household with a LIBOR-

linked mortgage and every corporation with a LIBOR-linked loan has an interest in more 

robust U.S. dollar reference rates. 

The Basics 

I will take a few moments to explain the basic mechanics of LIBOR for those who 

have not spent time on an interest rate swap desk.  For almost three decades, LIBOR was 

run by the British Bankers’ Association.  Just a few months ago, a private corporation 

called ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA) took over the daily production and 

administration of the rate subject to the regulation and supervision of the FCA.  Today, 

18 banks participate in the panel that contributes to the production of U.S. dollar LIBOR.  

Each morning at 11 a.m. London time, those banks estimate the rate at which they could 

borrow at several different maturities ranging from overnight up to a year, and they send 

those estimates to IBA.  It is often the case that banks have recent transactions at some 

but not all of these maturities.  Where there are no transactions, they submit estimates of 

their borrowing costs based on their judgment.  In addition to U.S. dollar LIBOR, the rate 

is produced in four other currencies--the euro, the yen, the British pound, and the Swiss 

franc--although not all banks contribute rates in all currencies.  The administrator 

provides specific instructions to the panel banks regarding their submissions; currently, 

these instructions direct banks to reflect the perceived rate at which they could borrow 

from another bank.7  The administrator collects these submissions and, after dropping the 

highest and lowest quartiles at each maturity, publishes an average of the remaining 

submissions as the U.S. dollar LIBOR rate for that day. 

                                                 
7 The actual question asks banks only about transactions of “reasonable market size.”  This size is not 

defined and is left to banks’ judgment.

Pervasive and Problematic 

When the British Bankers’ Association standardized LIBOR in the 1980s for use 

in interest rate products, I doubt that anyone could have imagined how pervasive it would 

eventually become.  As I mentioned, there are an estimated $300 trillion in LIBOR 

contracts, roughly half which reference dollar LIBOR.  In the United States, dollar 

LIBOR is the reference rate used in most interest rate swaps and futures contracts, in 

most floating-rate mortgages, in many commercial loans, and in structured products such 

as mortgage- and asset-backed securities.  The list could go on and on, but the key point 

is that LIBOR touches a large number of U.S. households and businesses. 

Although LIBOR is currently used for all of these purposes, it is actually not 

ideally suited for some of them.  LIBOR is designed to measure the costs of bank 

borrowing for a panel of large banks.  The rate can be decomposed into a component that 

reflects the general level of risk-free rates and a component that reflects a risk premium 

related to the credit risk of the borrowing bank.  During the global financial crisis, the 

credit risk component of LIBOR fluctuated dramatically, which meant that LIBOR 

behaved quite differently from rates with no credit risk embedded in them, such as risk-

free rates.   

LIBOR is a less-than-ideal rate for most derivatives contracts and secured 

borrowing because movements in the credit risk component do not reflect well the 

underlying risks of those contracts.  However, LIBOR’s pervasiveness has become self-

reinforcing.  Firms use LIBOR in contracts, even when it is less than ideal, because they 

know they can hedge the resulting risk using highly liquid, LIBOR-based interest rate 

swaps or other derivatives contracts.  And those derivatives markets are so liquid because

most market participants use LIBOR as the reference rate in their financial contracts.  

Because of the progression of this dynamic over time, and not because of some careful 

design, LIBOR has spread well beyond its intended uses and become an important pillar 

of the global financial system--perhaps too important. 

In recent years, two separate developments have called into question the wisdom 

of that arrangement.  I have already mentioned the first one--the emergence of a 

pervasive pattern of attempted manipulation of LIBOR dating back many years.  This 

misconduct was designed either to increase the potential profit of the submitting firms or 

to convey a misleading picture of the relative health of such firms.  Since 2012, seven 

financial institutions have settled related charges with the U.S. Commodity Futures 

Trading Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice, and the cumulative penalties 

and fines paid in the United States now stand at more than $3 billion.8  Global penalties 

paid related to benchmark misconduct exceed $6 billion as investigations into reference 

rate manipulation continue.  Although these penalties and fines are themselves 

substantial, to my mind the longer-term damage to the public’s trust represents the greater 

cost of this misconduct. 

A second problem is that unsecured interbank borrowing has been in a secular 

decline that predates the global financial crisis.  Changes in bank behavior following the 

crisis exacerbated the decline and further weakened the foundation of LIBOR.  The result 

is a scarcity, or outright absence in longer tenors, of actual transactions that banks can use 

to estimate their daily submission to LIBOR.  Ongoing regulatory reforms and the shift 

away from unsecured funding raise the possibility that unsecured interbank borrowing

UBS) and two brokers (ICAP and RP Martin).

transactions may become even more infrequent in the future.  While it is also possible 

that activity in these markets could rebound, the threat that this form of borrowing may 

decline further, particularly in periods of stress, seems likely to remain. 

So let me pose a question:  Is it wise to rely on a critical benchmark that is built 

on a market in decline?  Clearly not.  The risks to market functioning are simply too 

great.  For example, market activity could decline to the point where publication of a rate 

becomes untenable.  And many of the panel banks have expressed concerns about the 

ongoing legal risks of remaining on the panel.  If the publication of LIBOR were to 

become untenable or if we were to simply “end LIBOR,” as some have urged, untangling 

the $150 trillion in outstanding U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts would entail a protracted, 

expensive, and uncertain process of negotiating amendments to an enormous number of 

complex documents--a horrible mess and a feast for the legal profession, to be sure.  It 

does not help matters that the hundreds of trillions of dollars’ worth of derivatives 

contracts referencing LIBOR do not, in general, have robust backups in the event that 

publication of a rate ceases.   

The FSB report identifies ways to improve U.S. dollar LIBOR, and to create 

alternatives to it, while minimizing transition costs, particularly for end users who bear 

no blame for the misconduct.  The proposed reforms come down to two simple ideas.  

First, U.S. dollar LIBOR needs to be redefined to include a broader range of transaction 

types.  Doing so will make it more robust and will allow it to reflect actual bank funding 

costs, which is what the rate was intended to do in the first place.  Second, we need to 

promote robust alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR that better reflect the secured nature of 

many of today’s financial market transactions.

Updating U.S. Dollar LIBOR 

Let me first address the efforts the Federal Reserve is considering, in cooperation 

with the LIBOR administrator and U.K. authorities, to update the mechanics of U.S. 

dollar LIBOR.  Our aim is to make LIBOR more robust and more representative of 

current bank funding costs.  In this regard, we have considered two important attributes 

of LIBOR--its definition and the data used to produce it.   

While the current definition of LIBOR is limited to unsecured borrowing between 

banks, LIBOR is actually intended to represent the overall cost of banks’ unsecured 

borrowing.  At the time LIBOR was created, a substantial amount of that unsecured 

borrowing was in the interbank market, but that is no longer the case.  Broadening the 

definition to include the unsecured borrowing from nonbanks would make the rate more 

representative of current funding practices.  Changing the definition of LIBOR, as has 

been done in the past, would acknowledge the fact that a reference rate must adapt to 

continue to represent what it is meant to measure.9   

Updating the definition of U.S. dollar LIBOR could also allow other sources of 

transactions data to be incorporated into it.  Potentially, we could even move away from 

the current panel-based method of calculating U.S. dollar LIBOR to a rate that is fully 

transactions based.  In April, the Federal Reserve began collecting data from banks on a 

                                                 
9 For a reference to a past change in LIBOR, see the British Bankers’ Association’s website “BBA LIBOR” 

at www.bbalibor.com/disclaimer/explained/historical-perspective.  The design of BBA LIBOR has seen 

one significant change since its inception.  Up until 1998, banks submitted quotes to the BBA LIBOR 

process in line with the question “At what rate do you think interbank term deposits will be offered by one 

prime bank to another prime bank for a reasonable market size today at 11 am?”  During 1998, this 

question changed and has, up until today, been as follows:  “At what rate could you borrow funds, were 

you to do so by asking for and then accepting inter-bank offers in a reasonable market size just prior to 

11 am?”  This decision was made after consultation with the markets and was implemented due to a view 

that a universal definition of a prime bank could no longer be given.  It also links the figures submitted by 

banks to their own market activity rather than a hypothetical entity.  For a reference to the usefulness of the 

adaptability of reference rates, see Board of IOSCO, Principles for Financial Benchmarks, p. 12, in note 2.

variety of unsecured transactions.  These data, along with other available data, will help 

us understand whether there is enough borrowing activity to support a fully transactions-

based rate.10  It will take some time to assess these data and, in particular, to analyze the 

depth of the markets under different conditions and during different times of the year.  

But preliminary analysis, which is reinforced by research done by the Market Participants 

Group (MPG) that was assembled by the FSB, suggests that there may be enough 

borrowing activity to create a transactions-based U.S. dollar LIBOR rate.   

Basing U.S. dollar LIBOR more on transactions could modestly increase the 

volatility of the rate.  However, I see nothing wrong with a reference rate that more 

accurately reflects the volatility of the market it represents.  We are working closely with 

the LIBOR administrator, IBA, and with its regulator, FCA, to explore these issues.  In 

this regard, cooperation with IBA is crucial if LIBOR is to be strengthened--U.S. dollar 

LIBOR is produced in the United Kingdom and is not regulated here in the United States.  

The IOSCO review found that IBA has made progress in implementing most of the 

19 IOSCO principles; the changes I have discussed are designed to continue this 

progress, and I believe that IBA is well motivated to continue its efforts.11   

Alternatives Needed 

Improving U.S. dollar LIBOR alone cannot eliminate all of the weaknesses in the 

current system.  In the FSB’s opinion and that of the MPG, a large portion of the 

derivatives that currently reference U.S. dollar LIBOR would be better served by

referencing a risk-free (or nearly risk-free) rate based on a robust and liquid underlying 

market.  These transactions are more appropriately linked to a narrower measure of 

interest rates that does not include a bank credit risk component.  Encouraging 

alternatives that better reflect today’s funding markets would also allow for greater 

choice, increase the resilience of the system, and would potentially make hedging of 

some risks less costly.  In addition, the incentive to manipulate LIBOR would be 

substantially reduced if a smaller share of the multi-hundred-trillion-dollar derivatives 

market was referencing it. 

Some possible alternatives include rates based on the U.S. Treasury market or 

rates based on the secured funding markets that have replaced much of the borrowing 

banks used to do in the unsecured interbank market.  The Federal Reserve is not seeking 

to dictate the particular rate that financial markets adopt.  Instead, we will encourage key 

market participants to further the work done by the FSB’s MPG by narrowing down the 

list of alternatives and developing them into robust reference rates that meet agreed-upon 

international standards and best practices.12  There are enough suggestions on the MPG’s 

list to inspire confidence that we should be able to find common ground.  Any alternative 

would, of course, need to be in accord with the IOSCO principles mentioned earlier, and 

some potential alternatives would take time to fully develop.  But the establishment of 

alternative reference rates for certain products is in our shared interests and would 

substantially strengthen the financial system.

We are strongly committed that at least one such rate be developed and actively 

used as soon as practicable.  And we look forward to working with financial institutions 

and other market participants to achieve this end. 

In the near term, the Federal Reserve, along with other government agencies, 

intends to meet with a wide range of market participants, including end users, to hear 

their views as to how change can be effected and to begin the work of developing 

alternatives to LIBOR.  Later this year, we will convene a group of the largest global 

dealers to discuss these issues, following a model that was successfully used to promote 

derivatives reform.  Searching for potential alternative rates and encouraging their use 

will be a key point of that discussion.  Of course, end users will be affected by these 

changes as well, and we will also consult closely with key participants outside of the 

dealer community to make sure that reform meets their needs and is not disruptive to 

them.  In particular, end users who want to continue to use LIBOR will certainly be able 

to do so, and we will work toward the goal of ensuring that any changes to LIBOR will 

not require borrowers or lenders to amend their existing contracts.  And the markets that 

reference dollar LIBOR are so enormous that there will surely be more than enough 

liquidity to support both a new risk free rate as well as LIBOR itself. 

One of the lessons that I take from our study of LIBOR is that these existing 

legacy contracts are quite important.  As I mentioned earlier, many financial contracts, 

including derivatives contracts, do not have robust backups in the event that the reference 

rates they use cease to exist.  Some derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, can be quite 

long lasting, and, over a long enough period of time, there is always a risk that any given 

reference rate will cease being published.  It is important that financial contracts address 


 - 11 - 

the need for a backup plan if a reference rate does cease to function.  This issue is 

something that we intend to bring up with market participants and end users as we meet 

with them.  

Conclusion 

My hope is that governments, market participants, and end users can work 

together to build a stronger foundation for the reference interest rates that are so critical 

to our financial system.  Implementation of these measures is clearly in the interest of 

U.S. financial stability.  I also hope and expect that individual financial institutions will 

understand that it is also in their private interests.  Reference rates are one of the 

foundations of the financial system, and it is in the interest of everyone, from the 

residential mortgage holder to the financial institutions that heavily use these rates, that 

those foundations have integrity and be well constructed and resistant to manipulation.  

As I said at the beginning, the problems with LIBOR have undermined the public’s trust 

in the financial system.  In light of the need to regain that trust, I am certain that our 

reform efforts will meet with the active cooperation of financial institutions in carrying 

forward these reforms.
