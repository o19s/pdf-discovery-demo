In the months ahead, my colleagues and I will continue to assess what policy path 

will best promote the sustained attainment of our goals.  With that in mind, I would like 

to start by describing the contours of today’s economy that will be particularly important 

in shaping the appropriate path of policy before reviewing recent developments.  These 

contours represent noteworthy departures from the “old normal” that prevailed in the 

decades prior to the financial crisis.  I would argue that policy today must rely less on the 

old normal as a guidepost and instead be sensitive to the contours that shape today’s 

“new normal.”1   

Key Features of the “New Normal” 

Because monetary policy is forward looking, policymakers must assess how key 

features of the economic environment are most likely to influence the future path of the 

economy and shape policy accordingly.  At a time when our assessment of the economy 

is evolving, several features of the “new normal”--some of which are interrelated--appear 

particularly noteworthy for our policy deliberations: 

1. Inflation Has Been Undershooting, and the Phillips Curve Has Flattened 

First, for the past several decades, policymakers relied on the empirical 

relationship between unemployment and inflation embodied in the Phillips curve as a key 

guidepost for monetary policy.  The Phillips curve implied that as labor market slack 

diminished and the economy approached full employment, upward pressure on inflation 

would result.  However, since 2012, inflation has tended to change relatively little--both 

absolutely and relative to earlier decades--as the unemployment rate has fallen 

                                                 
I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text.

Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.

considerably.2  At a time when the unemployment rate has fallen from 8.2 percent to 

4.9 percent, inflation has undershot our 2 percent target now for 51 straight months.3  In 

other words, the Phillips curve appears to be flatter today than it was previously.   

With the Phillips curve appearing to be a less reliable guidepost than it has been 

in the past, the anchoring role of inflation expectations remains critically important.  On 

expected similar to realized inflation, recent developments suggest some reasons to be 

concerned more about undershooting than overshooting.  Although some survey 

measures have remained well anchored at 2 percent, consumer surveys have moved to the 

lower end of their historical ranges and have not risen sustainably.4  Meanwhile, 

market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined noticeably over the past 

two years at longer-term horizons, and have shown little improvement despite the recent 

stabilization in the price of oil and the exchange rate.  Thus, we cannot rule out that the 

sustained period of undershooting the inflation target along with global disinflationary 

pressures are weighing on inflation expectations.  

Recognition of these developments is reflected in the evolution of the forecasts of 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants in the Summary of Economic 

Projections (SEP) from June 2012 to June 2016.  The SEP forecasts have shown repeated 

mark downs of the central tendency of the projection for core PCE (personal 

consumption expenditures) inflation, and the attainment of 2 percent at the upper end of 

the range has been pushed out repeatedly from 2012 initially to 2017 most recently.   

                                                 
2 See Blanchard (2016), Kiley (2015b), and Brainard (2015a),  
3 The inflation information refers to core PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation measured on a 

12-month average basis. 
4 For example, over the past 12 months, median 5-to-10 year-ahead inflation expectations from the 

University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers were 1/4 percentage point below the average over the prior 

10 years. 




- 3 - 

The apparent flatness of the Phillips curve together with evidence that inflation 

expectations may have softened on the downside and the persistent undershooting of 

inflation relative to our target should be important considerations in our policy 

deliberations.  In particular, to the extent that the effect on inflation of further gradual 

tightening in labor market conditions is likely to be moderate and gradual, the case to 

tighten policy preemptively is less compelling.   

2. Labor Market Slack Has Been Greater than Anticipated  

Second, and related, although we have seen important progress on employment, 

this improvement has been accompanied by evidence of greater slack than previously 

anticipated.  This uncertainty about the true state of the economy suggests we should be 

open to the possibility of material further progress in the labor market.  Indeed, with 

payroll employment growth averaging 180,000 per month this year, many observers 

would have expected the unemployment rate to drop noticeably rather than moving 

sideways, as it has done.  It is true that today’s unemployment rate of 4.9 percent is only 

0.1 percentage point from the median SEP participant’s estimate of the longer-run level 

of unemployment.  However, the natural rate of unemployment is uncertain and can vary 

over time.  Indeed, in the SEP, the central tendency of the projection for the longer-run 

natural rate of unemployment has come down significantly, from a range of 5.2 to 

6.0 percent in June 2012 to 4.7 to 5.0 percent in June 2016--a reduction of 1/2 to 

1 percentage point.5  We cannot rule out that estimates of the natural unemployment rate 

may move even lower.

In addition, the unemployment rate is not the only gauge of labor market slack, 

and other measures have been suggesting there is some room to go.  The share of 

employees working part time for economic reasons, for example, has remained 

noticeably above its pre-crisis level.  Of particular significance, the prime-age labor force 

participation rate, despite improvement this year, remains about 1-1/2 percentage points 

below its pre-crisis level, suggesting room for further gains.  While it is possible that the 

current low level of prime-age participation reflects ongoing pre-crisis trends, we cannot 

rule out that it reflects a lagged and still incomplete response to a very slow recovery 

in job opportunities and wages.6   

This possibility is reinforced by the continued muted recovery in wage growth.  

Although wage growth has picked up to about a 2-1/2 percent pace in recent quarters, this 

pace is only modestly above that which prevailed over much of the recovery and well 

below growth rates seen prior to the financial crisis.7 

My main point here is that in the presence of uncertainty and the absence of 

accelerating inflationary pressures, it would be unwise for policy to foreclose on the 

possibility of making further gains in the labor market.

Levin (2014), and Council of Economic Advisers (2016). 
7 Over the 12 months ending in August 2016, average hourly earnings increased 2.4 percent.  Over the 

12 months ending in June, the employment cost index for private-sector workers also increased 2.4 percent.  

The more volatile compensation per hour measure for the business sector has increased at an annual rate of 

2.6 percent over the past eight quarters.  From the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2014, these 

measures all increased at an average annual rate of around 2 percent.  From the fourth quarter of 2003 to 

the fourth quarter of 2007, the compensation per hour and employment cost index measures increased at an 

average annual rate of around 3-1/2 percent.  Average hourly earnings for all workers were not available 

for this period.

3. Foreign Markets Matter, Especially because Financial Transmission is Strong 

Third, disinflation pressure and weak demand from abroad will likely weigh on 

the U.S. outlook for some time, and fragility in global markets could again pose risks 

here at home.8  In Europe, recovery continues, but growth is slow and inflation is very 

low.  Low growth and a flat yield curve are contributing to reduced profitability and a 

higher cost of equity financing for banks, which in turn could impair bank lending, one of 

the main transmission channels of monetary policy in the euro area’s bank-centric 

financial system.  A low growth, low inflation environment also makes progress on fiscal 

sustainability difficult and leaves countries with high debt-to-gross domestic product 

(GDP) ratios vulnerable to adverse demand shocks.  Against this backdrop, uncertainty 

about Britain’s future relationship with the European Union could damp business 

sentiment and investment in Europe. 

Japan remains greatly challenged by weak growth and low inflation.  Indeed, it is 

striking that despite active and creative monetary policies in both the euro area and Japan, 

inflation remains below target levels.  The experiences of these economies highlight the 

risk of becoming trapped in a low-growth, low-inflation, low-inflation-expectations 

environment and suggest that policy should be oriented toward minimizing the risk of the 

U.S. economy slipping into such a situation.   

                                                 
8 The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has repeatedly marked down its forecast of world economic 

growth in recent years.  From April 2014 to July of this year, for example, the IMF revised down 2015 

growth from 3.9 percent to 3.1 percent.  And from April 2015 to July of this year, the IMF revised down 

2016 growth from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent.  See the IMF’s World Economic Outlook at 

http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=29.

Downside risks are also present in emerging market economies, where growth has 

slowed rapidly in recent years.9  Most importantly, China is undergoing a challenging 

transition from a growth model based on investment, exports, and debt-fueled state-

owned enterprises to one driven by consumption, services, and dynamic private 

businesses.  Because of the adjustment costs along this transition path and demographic 

trends, Chinese growth will likely continue to slow.  Given that China has experienced 

very high growth in corporate debt, this downshift could pose risks.  Importantly, Chinese 

authorities have made some progress on clarifying their policy stance, and capital 

outflows have slowed in recent months.  Nonetheless, considerable uncertainty remains, 

and further volatility cannot be ruled out.  The importance of Chinese growth and 

stability to many emerging market economies and to global markets more broadly implies 

that these risks have global implications.    

Headwinds from abroad should matter to U.S. policymakers because recent 

experience suggests global financial markets are tightly integrated, such that disturbances 

emanating from Chinese or euro-area financial markets quickly spill over to U.S. 

financial markets.  The fallout from adverse foreign shocks appears to be more 

powerfully transmitted to the U.S. than previously.  Indeed, recent research suggests that 

changes in expectations regarding the path of policy in the United States relative to other 

major economies lead to exchange rate movements that appear to be several times bigger 

than they were several years ago.10  The fact that many advanced economies are suffering 

from deficient demand and have policy rates at or near the zero bound and that the U.S. 

                                                 
9 Emerging market growth, as weighted by a country’s share of U.S. exports, has decreased from an 

average pace of 5-1/4 percent from the fourth quarter of 2009 to the fourth quarter of 2012 to a little over 2 

percent last year.

dollar is a favored safe-haven asset may imply that adverse foreign demand shocks have a 

particularly strong effect on the value of the dollar, effectively transmitting the weakness 

to the U.S. economy.11   

In turn, U.S. activity and inflation appear to be importantly influenced by these 

exchange rate movements.  In particular, estimates from the FRB/US model suggest that 

the nearly 20 percent appreciation of the dollar from June 2014 to January of this year 

could be having an effect on U.S. economic activity roughly equivalent to a 200 basis 

point increase in the federal funds rate.  Interestingly, it appears that this effect showed 

through in decreased business investment activity and stagnant manufacturing output, 

while the anticipated effect on net exports may have been somewhat dampened by 

depressed demand for imports of capital goods, among other factors. 

4. The Neutral Rate Is Likely to Remain Very Low for Some Time  

Fourth, perhaps most salient for monetary policy, it appears increasingly clear that 

the neutral rate of interest remains considerably and persistently lower than it was before 

the crisis.  Over the current expansion, with a federal funds rate at, or near, zero and the 

additional support provided by asset purchases and reinvestment, GDP growth has 

averaged a very modest rate upward of 2 percent, and inflation has averaged only 

1-1/2 percent.  Ten years ago, based on the underlying economic relationships that 

prevailed at the time, it would have seemed inconceivable that real activity and inflation 

would be so subdued given the stance of monetary policy.  To reconcile these 

developments, it is difficult not to conclude that the current level of the federal funds rate 

is less accommodative today than it would have been 10 years ago.  Put differently, the 

                                                 
11 See Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2015). 




- 8 - 

amount of aggregate demand associated with a given level of the interest rate is now 

much lower than before the crisis.   

In the early stages of the recovery, most observers thought that the cyclical 

headwinds restraining demand and lowering the neutral rate would dissipate, and that the 

neutral rate would move gradually back to the pre-crisis norm of 2 percent.  But seven 

years into the expansion and with little sign of a significant acceleration in activity, the 

low neutral rate looks likely to persist.  Indeed, developments over the past year confirm 

that the underlying causes will be with us for some time.12  Foreign consumption and 

investment are weak, while foreign demand for savings is high, along with an elevated 

demand for safe assets.  Productivity growth, which increased at an average annual rate 

of nearly 2-1/2 percent from 1950 to 2000, has increased only 1/2 percent on average 

over the past five years, and demographics also suggest a persistent slowing of the labor 

force.   

Recognition of the reduction in the long-run neutral federal funds rate is perhaps 

the most consequential change in the SEP forecasts.  In the four years between June 2012 

and June 2016, the estimate of the long-run federal funds rate has declined from 

4.25 percent to 3.0 percent--nearly one-third.  Over one-third of that adjustment has 

occurred between December 2015 and June 2016.  It is notable that this recent step-down 

in the SEP estimate has coincided with a period of easing in financial conditions and a 

stabilization in the exchange rate as market participants have taken into account changes 

in the perceived FOMC policy reaction function. 

                                                 
12 For a fuller description of the likely contributors to a persistent low neutral rate, see Brainard (2015b) 

and Goodfriend (2016). 




- 9 - 

Several econometric models and estimates from market participants suggest the 

current real neutral rate is at or close to zero, and any increase is likely to be shallow and 

slow.13  These estimates imply that it may require a relatively more modest adjustment in 

the policy rate to return to neutral over time than previously anticipated.   

5. Policy Options Are Asymmetric  

 The four features just discussed that define the new normal make it likely that we 

will continue to grapple with a fifth new reality for some time:  the ability of monetary 

policy to respond to shocks is asymmetric.  With policy rates near the zero lower bound 

and likely to return there more frequently even if the economy only experiences shocks 

similar in magnitude to those experienced pre-crisis, due to the low level of the neutral 

rate, there is an asymmetry in the policy tools available to respond to adverse 

developments.  Conventional changes in the federal funds rate, our most tested and best 

understood tool, cannot be used as readily to respond to downside shocks to aggregate 

demand as it can to upside shocks.  While there are, of course, other policy options, these 

alternatives have constraints and uncertainties that are not present with conventional 

policy.14  From a risk-management perspective, therefore, the asymmetry in the 

conventional policy toolkit would lead me to expect policy to be tilted somewhat in favor 

of guarding against downside risks relative to preemptively raising rates to guard against 

upside risks. 

                                                 
13 See, for example, Laubach and Williams (2015); Del Negro, Giannoni, and Smith (2016); Cúrdia (2015); 

Lubik and Matthes (2015); Kiley (2015a); and Johannsen and Mertens (2016) for econometric estimates of 

the neutral rate, or the closely related concept of the natural rate of interest.  See the Federal Reserve Bank 

of New York’s most recent Survey of Market Participants 

(https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey_market_participants.html) and Survey of Primary Dealers 

(https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/primarydealer_survey_questions.html) for forecasters’ estimates of 

the current neutral rate.   
14 See Reifschneider (2016). 




- 10 - 

Because a persistently low neutral rate implies less room for conventional 

monetary policy to adjust to adverse developments, it will be important to assess whether 

our current policy tools are adequate to respond to negative shocks and, if not, what 

adjustments would be most appropriate.  There is a growing literature on such policy 

alternatives, such as raising the inflation target, moving to a nominal income target, or 

deploying negative interest rates.15  These options merit further assessment.  However, 

they are largely untested and would take some time to assess and prepare.  For the time 

being, the most effective way to address these concerns is to ensure that our policy 

actions align with our commitment to achieving the existing inflation target, which the 

Committee has recently clarified is symmetric around 2 percent--and not a ceiling--along 

with maximum employment.  

Recent Developments Suggest Gradual Progress 

 Against the backdrop of these five features of the new normal that are most salient 

for conditioning policy, I will briefly summarize my take on recent economic 

developments and their implications for policy.  The economy has seen welcome 

progress on some fronts in recent months, supported by the cautious approach taken by 

the Committee and a corresponding easing in financial conditions:  The labor market has 

continued to improve, consumer confidence has remained high, and we have navigated 

past near-term risks from abroad.   

Overall, the recent data on the labor market and aggregate spending suggest that 

we are continuing to move toward full employment, but that progress has been, and likely 

will be, somewhat gradual.  This year, monthly job gains have averaged 180,000, below 

                                                 
15 See Romer (2011), Blanchard, Dell’Ariccia and Mauro (2010), Ball (2014), Haldane (2015), Bernanke 

(2015), and Goodfriend (2016). 




- 11 - 

last year’s pace but still sufficient to reduce labor market slack.  The slowing pace of job 

gains has been associated with a flattening out in the unemployment rate over the past 

year, along with a heartening 1/2 percentage point increase in the prime-age labor force 

participation rate.  These developments suggest that an improving job market has made 

joining, or remaining in, the labor force increasingly attractive, and may imply that the 

labor market has room for further improvement.   

Recent spending data suggest a pickup in third-quarter growth.  In particular, real 

consumer spending increased at nearly a 4 percent annual pace over the three months 

ending in July, driven by continued job growth, buoyant consumer sentiment, and rising 

household wealth.  Nonetheless, spending in other sectors has been disappointing.  Weak 

foreign growth and the net appreciation of the dollar over the past two years have 

weighed heavily on net exports, corporate profitability, business investment, and 

manufacturing production.  Business investment has declined in each of the past three 

quarters, and the latest data on housing permits suggest that residential investment slowed 

noticeably in the middle of this year.  As a result, economic activity over the past three 

quarters has been disappointing, with growth in GDP and gross domestic income each 

averaging less than 1 percent, a significant step-down from the same period in 2015.   

Looking ahead, the stabilization of the dollar and oil prices suggests that growth 

in these components should move higher over the second half of the year.  Indeed, 

exports, which have declined since the end of 2014, moved slightly higher last quarter, 

and the number of oil drilling rigs in operation has begun to edge up after sharp declines 

over the past two years, a positive sign for business investment.  In addition, inventory 




- 12 - 

investment, which edged lower last quarter, should step up over the second half of the 

year to a level more in line with continued moderate increases in final sales.   

We have also seen signs of progress on our inflation mandate.  In July, the 

12-month change in core PCE prices was 1.6 percent, higher than a year ago, but still 

noticeably below our 2 percent target.  The stabilization of the dollar and oil prices 

should lead inflation to move back toward our target in coming quarters.  Non-oil import 

prices, which fell steadily from the end of 2014 through the first quarter of this year, 

edged up in the second quarter and, if the dollar remains steady, should continue to rise 

going forward.  Continued progress in inflation will also depend on inflation expectations 

remaining well anchored and not drifting lower.  The evidence here is mixed, as I noted 

earlier.   

Policy Implications  

The five features of the current economic landscape that I have highlighted lean 

roughly in the same direction:  In today’s new normal, the costs to the economy of 

greater-than-expected strength in demand are likely to be lower than the costs of 

significant unexpected weakness.  In the case of unexpected strength, we have well-tried 

and tested tools and ample policy space in which to react.  Moreover, because of Phillips 

curve flattening, the possibility of remaining labor market slack, the likely substantial 

response of the exchange rate and its depressing effect on inflation, the low neutral rate, 

and the fact that inflation expectations are well anchored to the upside, the response of 

inflation to unexpected strength in demand will likely be modest and gradual, requiring a 

correspondingly moderate policy response and implying relatively slight costs to the 

economy.  In the face of an adverse shock, however, our conventional policy toolkit is 




- 13 - 

more limited, and thus the risk of being unable to adequately respond to unexpected 

weakness is greater.  The experience of the Japanese and euro-area economies suggest 

that prolonged weakness in demand is very difficult to correct, leading to economic costs 

that can be considerable. 

This asymmetry in risk management in today’s new normal counsels prudence in 

the removal of policy accommodation.  I believe this approach has served us well in 

recent months, helping to support continued gains in employment and progress on 

inflation.  I look forward to assessing the evolution of the data in the months ahead for 

signs of further progress toward our goals, bearing in mind these considerations.
