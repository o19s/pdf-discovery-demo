June 12, 2012 




The three decades preceding the financial crisis were characterized in the United States 

by the progressive integration of traditional lending and capital markets activities.  This trend 

diminished the importance of deposits as a source of funding for credit extension in favor of 

capital market instruments sold to institutional investors.  It also altered the structure of the 

financial services industry, both transforming the activities of broker-dealers and fostering the 

emergence of large financial conglomerates.  Although the structure of foreign banking systems 

was less noticeably changed, many foreign banks drew increasingly on the resulting wholesale 

funding markets and made significant investments in the mortgage-backed securities that had 

proliferated in the first decade of this century. 

The financial crisis underscored the failure of the American regulatory system to keep 

pace with these developments and revealed the need for two reform agendas.  One must be 

aimed specifically at the problem of too-big-to-fail institutions.  The other must be directed at the 

so-called shadow banking system, which refers to credit intermediation involving leverage and 

maturity transformation that is partly or wholly outside the traditional banking system.  As I have 

noted on other occasions, most reforms to date have concentrated on too-big-to-fail institutions, 

though many of these reforms have yet to be fully implemented.  The shadow banking system, 

on the other hand, has been only obliquely addressed, despite the fact that the most acute phase 

of the crisis was precipitated by a run on that system.  Indeed, as the oversight of regulated 

institutions is strengthened, opportunities for arbitrage in the shadow banking system may 

increase. 

Today I want to focus on the development of a regulatory reform agenda for the shadow 

banking system.  As those who have been following the academic and policy debates know, 

there are significant, ongoing  disagreements concerning the roles of various factors contributing 


- 2 - 


to the rapid growth of the shadow banking system, the precise dynamics of the runs in 2007 and 

2008, and the relative social utility of some elements of this system.  Conclusions drawn from 

these debates will be important in eventually framing a broadly directed regulatory plan for the 

shadow banking system.  However, as it is neither necessary nor wise to await such conclusions 

in order to begin implementing a regulatory response, I will follow my discussion of the 

vulnerabilities created by shadow banking with some suggestions for near- and medium-term 

reforms.   

Fragility of the Shadow Banking System 

It is not my purpose here today to discuss the history and complex nature of the shadow 

banking system.  There is a rich and growing academic literature devoted to this task.  However, 

I do want to identify some features of shadow banking that are reasonably well-established and 

particularly salient for reform efforts.   

First, and in many respects foremost, it bears noting that the use of the term ―shadow 

banking‖ refers not simply to the functions of credit intermediation and maturity transformation.  

Shadow banking also refers to the creation of assets that are thought to be safe, short-term, and 

liquid, and as such, ―cash equivalents‖ similar to insured deposits in the commercial banking 

system.  Of course, as many financial market actors learned to their dismay, in periods of stress 

these assets are not the same as insured deposits.   

The years preceding the financial crisis saw a surge in the volume of dollar-denominated, 

seemingly safe, seemingly liquid financial instruments.  The causal interplay of factors leading to 

this surge is still actively debated.  But it seems reasonably clear that both a rise in the demand 

by investors for safe, liquid assets as tools for precautionary or transactional liquidity and a rise 


- 3 - 


in demand for short-term financing by certain borrowers—notably financial intermediaries 

looking to fund longer-term assets—played important, probably reciprocally reinforcing roles. 

Examples of investor demand for safe, liquid assets are not hard to identify.  One source 

has been foreign official investors, mostly emerging market countries, which invested about $1.6 

trillion in the United States in the four years preceding the crisis, largely in U.S. Treasury and 

agency securities.  Much of this activity arose from the investment of foreign exchange reserves 

by countries running large current account surpluses.  Some of these reserves were undoubtedly 

built up as a precautionary measure in light of the financial problems in emerging markets during 

the late 1990s, while others are attendant to policies of managed exchange rates.  This official 

sector demand for safe assets was largely if not entirely focused on U.S. government securities, 

rather than cash equivalents.  But this source of demand absorbed roughly 80 percent of the 

increase in U.S. Treasury and agency securities over the four-year period, potentially crowding 

out other investors and thereby increasing their demand for cash equivalents that appeared to be 

of comparable safety and liquidity. 

A second source of demand has been nonfinancial firms, which responded to the market 

disruptions associated with defaults by Enron and other firms more than a decade ago by 

boosting their holdings of cash.  The pressure to hold large amounts of cash likely increased 

when a major ratings agency began publishing liquidity risk assessments of nonfinancial firms.  

A third source of demand for cash equivalents resulted from the adoption of more 

elaborate investment strategies by many institutional investors.  For example, as more such 

investors used derivatives or short-selling as part of their overall strategies, they needed cash or 

cash-like instruments for margining and other collateral purposes.  Moreover, of course, as the 

amount of assets under professional management increased, the demand for safe, liquid 


- 4 - 


investments also inevitably increased, since intermediaries need a place to park funds that are 

awaiting investment or needed to meet unexpected withdrawals. 

The growing demand for safe and liquid assets was met largely by the shadow banking 

system’s creation of assets that were seemingly safe and seemingly liquid.
1
  New varieties of 

shadow-banking activities were created, some pre-existing types grew larger, and the shadow 

banking system became much more internationalized.  For example, the volume of asset-backed 

commercial paper, or ABCP, grew enormously.  Many ABCP vehicles issued short-term, highly 

rated liabilities and bought longer-term, highly rated securities, often mortgage-backed 

securities.  Many of the vehicles were sponsored abroad, especially by European banks, which 

issued dollar-denominated ABCP in the U.S. market and bought dollar-denominated assets in the 

U.S. market.  The overall volume of this activity was very large, although the net flows between 

the U.S. and Europe were not, leaving European bank sponsors of such ABCP vehicles with a 

huge exposure when market participants stopped believing that ABCP was risk-free.   

It now seems clear that the tail risk associated with many shadow-banking instruments 

was not understood by many market actors, including both sellers and buyers.  An important 

contributing factor on the buyers' side that helped set the stage for the 2007-2008 financial crisis 

was the widespread acceptance that risk-free assets could be created by augmenting what was 

already thought to be a low-risk asset with a promise from a large financial institution to provide 

liquidity or bear credit losses in the unlikely event that such support might be needed.  When, in

 Insured demand deposits at traditional banks can help meet the needs of large investors, but only to a limited 

extent.  Such accounts are unattractive to large investors because of the limited scale of Federal Deposit Insurance 

Corporation (FDIC) deposit insurance; large deposits are, beyond the insurance cap, effectively unsecured exposures 

to a single bank, and small deposits at multiple banks are inconvenient.  The expansion of FDIC insurance to all 

noninterest bearing accounts, regardless of size—which occurred in November 2008 and which is scheduled to 

expire at the end of this year—has made deposits more attractive and more heavily utilized.

stressed conditions, the credibility of the promise came into question, the susceptibility to runs 

increased dramatically.   

In some cases, there were explicit contractual provisions for liquidity support or credit 

enhancements, such as were provided to ABCP vehicles by their sponsoring banks.  In other 

cases, the support was more implicit, and was conveyed in the marketing of the assets or through 

an historical pattern of providing support.  Forms of implicit credit support were present in a 

variety of important funding channels and, to a considerable degree, persist today.  Three 

examples are money market funds, the triparty repo market, and securities lending.  

Money market funds aim to maintain a stable net asset value of one dollar per share and 

to meet redemption requests upon demand.  As such they are the very model of a nonbank 

―deposit‖ or cash equivalent.
2
  Unlike other mutual funds, money market funds are allowed to 

round their net asset values to one dollar per share so long as the underlying value of each share 

remains within one-half cent of a dollar.  But a drop in the unrounded net asset value of more 

than one-half of one percent causes a money fund to ―break the buck,‖ a scenario in which 

losses, at least in theory, would be passed along to the fund’s investors.   

However, fund sponsors historically have absorbed losses whenever necessary to prevent 

funds from breaking the buck, with only two exceptions.  Even though they had no legal 

obligation to do so, sponsors voluntarily supported their funds more than 100 times between 

1989 and 2003, presumably because allowing a fund to break the buck would have damaged the 

sponsor’s reputation and franchise.  This tendency was well understood by investors.  Indeed, a 

standard reference book on money markets states that a ―money fund run by an entity with deep

pockets, while it may not have federal insurance, certainly has something akin to private 

insurance . . . likely to prove adequate to cover any losses sustained by the fund.‖

Many money funds sustained significant capital losses when the market for asset-backed 

commercial paper collapsed in the summer and fall of 2007.  As in previous decades, losses at 

money funds were absorbed by the funds’ sponsors.  Indeed, money funds were seen as highly 

safe in 2007 and received large net inflows as concerns about other portions of the financial 

system increased.     

But when, in 2008, the Reserve Primary Fund did not provide support for the relatively 

small losses at its money market fund, the illusion that money funds were effectively as safe as 

insured bank accounts was shattered.  A general run on money funds ensued.  Within two days, 

investors withdrew nearly $200 billion from prime money market funds, about 10 percent of 

their assets.  This contributed to severe funding pressures for issuers of commercial paper.  The 

run ultimately prompted—and was stopped by—unprecedented interventions by the Treasury 

and the Federal Reserve to provide insurance and liquidity support to the industry. 

A second example is the triparty repo market, which had grown to about $2.8 trillion of 

outstanding financing by early 2007.  In general, a repo, or ―repurchase agreement,‖ is the sale of 

a security with an agreement to repurchase the security at a later date; the economics of repos are 

similar to that of short-term loans collateralized by longer-term assets.  So-called triparty repos, 

typically used by broker-dealers to raise financing from cash-rich institutions such as money 

market funds, insurance companies, and some central banks, utilizes a particular settlement 

mechanism.  The third party in this triparty market is a clearing bank, which handles settlement 

through accounts held at that institution by the broker-dealers who are cash borrowers and the

cash lenders.  Because the composition and size of broker-dealers’ inventories can change 

rapidly with the levels of trading activity, broker-dealers find the very flexible and inexpensive 

short-term financing offered by triparty repos to be extremely attractive.  To the extent that this 

borrowing appeared riskless to lenders, broker-dealers were potential suppliers through triparty 

repos of the safe, liquid assets that were in such demand.     

Broker-dealers who borrow in the triparty repo market want to have access to their 

securities for routine trading purposes—for example, to make deliveries to clients during the day.  

To allow for that, the market developed a critical operational feature called the ―daily unwind.‖  

Each day, the clearing banks ―unwind‖ all repo trades, returning securities to borrowers and cash 

to lenders, even for longer-dated term transactions.  However, the securities still require 

financing during the day.  To this end, borrowers rely on intraday overdrafts at the two major 

clearing banks.  At the end of the day, the transactions are ―re-wound.‖  Thus, the risks 

associated with the portfolios of securities are fully transferred twice each day.   

The lenders in this market widely believed that the two clearing banks would always 

unwind their maturing trades in the morning, returning cash to their account, despite no 

contractual provision requiring that the clearing banks do so.  The fact that lenders believed they 

were protected in this way by the clearing bank helped perpetuate the illusion that, particularly 

when lending overnight, they were invested in a money-like asset that would always be highly 

liquid and safe, even though in reality the borrower was usually an entity that could go bankrupt.   

This illusion faded as the financial crisis progressed.  Significant strains were created by 

concerns about the financial strength of the broker-dealers, uncertainty about the value of the 

underlying collateral, and belated recognition that the clearing banks were not contractually 

obligated to unwind maturing trades.  Only when the prospect of dealer failures became very 


- 8 - 


real—for example, in the case of Countrywide’s broker-dealer affiliate in August 2007 and Bear 

Stearns in March 2008—did the lenders appear to see these risks clearly.  In addition, the 

presumed stabilizing function of collateral was weakened, since a default by a dealer or clearing 

bank could leave lenders with securities posted as collateral that they had no desire, operational 

capacity, or even, in some cases, legal authority to hold, or at least liquidate in an orderly way. 

The response at that point was to flee, ignoring the protection putatively afforded by collateral. 

Only because of unprecedented official-sector action did the triparty repo market not 

suffer the same kind of disastrous run as did money market funds.  A broad run on triparty repos 

would have severely impacted all major broker-dealers and thus the U.S. securities industry as a 

whole.  The Primary Dealer Credit Facility—instituted on an emergency basis immediately after 

the failure of Bear Stearns—provided emergency lending to dealers, injected liquidity into the 

system, and provided a backstop that reassured markets.  This public-sector support prevailed 

where implicit private-sector support had come into question, and helped stabilize the triparty 

repo market.  

My third example of a funding channel characterized by tacit credit support is the 

securities lending market, which is driven in large part by demand for securities by financial 

institutions wanting to establish short positions or needing collateral to support other 

transactions.  Securities lenders in this market are typically owners of large pools of securities 

such as pension plans, endowments, and insurance companies.  The securities borrower posts 

collateral, usually cash in the United States, which a custodian bank then typically invests on 

behalf of the securities lender in supposedly safe and liquid investments, including money 

market funds, triparty repos, and other short-term instruments.  The gains from these 


- 9 - 


reinvestment activities provide a significant amount—in some cases, all—of the compensation to 

the securities lender associated with participating in the lending program.

The custodian banks all but universally provided a contractual indemnification to the 

securities lender that required them to absorb any losses to the securities lenders if the securities 

were not returned.  But the investment returns, and risk of loss on the reinvestment of cash 

collateral that would have to be returned to the borrowers of securities, generally were not 

covered by such indemnifications.  Nonetheless, a number of securities lenders seemed to 

believe otherwise, and in many cases their expectations were fulfilled as custodian banks agreed 

during the financial crisis to bear at least some of the losses from cash collateral reinvestment 

programs.  

Although the experiences of money market funds, triparty repos, and securities lending 

vary in the details, they all share a common underlying pathology:  Offering documents with 

stern warnings notwithstanding, explicit and implicit commitments combined with a history of 

discretionary support to create an assumption, even among sophisticated investors, that low-risk 

assets were free of credit and liquidity risk – effectively cash, but with a slightly higher return.  

This risk illusion led to pervasive underpricing of the risks embedded in these money-like 

instruments and made them an artificially cheap source of funding.  The consequent oversupply 

of these instruments contributed importantly to systemic risk.   

Reliance on private mechanisms to create seemingly riskless assets generally worked in 

the relatively calm years leading up to the financial crisis and, to some extent, well into the crisis.  

But, in many cases, discretionary support came into question at the time of acute financial-

market stress, precisely when it was needed most, as questions arose about the ability or 

                                                 
4
 Much of the attention devoted to securities lending in the wake of the crisis focused on the program run by AIG.  

In addition to general issues involving the reinvestment of cash collateral, AIG’s securities lending program had 

more specific and fundamental flaws that go beyond the concerns discussed here.

willingness of large financial institutions to follow through on their implicit commitments.  

Investors were reminded of their potential exposure, leading to wholesale and sometimes 

disorderly flight.  The unwinding of this risk illusion helped transform a dramatic correction in 

real estate valuations—which itself would have had serious consequences for the economy—into 

a crisis that threatened the entire financial system. 

Shaping a Regulatory Response 

  Ideally, a regulatory response to the shadow banking system would be grounded in a full 

understanding of the dynamics that drove its rapid growth, the social utility of its intermediation 

activities, and the risks they create.  Such a response would be comprehensive, meaning that it 

would cover in an effective and efficient manner any activities that create these vulnerabilities, 

without regard to how the activities were denominated, what transaction forms were used, or 

where they were conducted.  Of course, many of the key issues are still being debated, and even 

those who agree on the desirability of a comprehensive response may differ on its basic form.   

We should continue to seek the analytic and policy consensus that must precede the 

creation of a regulatory program that meets these conditions.  More work is needed on 

fundamental issues such as the implications of private money creation and of intermediaries 

behaving like banks but without bank-like regulation.  These implications are potentially quite 

profound for central banking and banking regulation, considering that the shadow banking 

system has caused the volume of money-like instruments created outside the purview of central 

bank and regulatory control to grow markedly.   

But regulators need not wait for the full resolution of contested issues or the development 

of comprehensive alternatives, nor would it be prudent for them to do so.  We should act now to 

address some obvious sources of vulnerability in the financial system.  I believe that the 


- 11 - 


foregoing discussion of implicit support for various shadow banking instruments helps identify 

areas where misunderstanding and mispricing of risk are more likely, with the result that 

destabilizing runs are a real possibility.   

Let me then suggest three more-or-less immediate steps that regulators here and abroad 

should take, as well as a medium-term reform undertaking. 

First, we should create greater transparency with respect to the various transactions and 

markets that comprise the shadow banking system.  For example, large segments of the repo 

market remain opaque today.  In fact, at present there is no way that regulators or market 

participants can precisely determine even the overall volume of bilateral repo transactions—that 

is, transactions not settled using the triparty mechanism.  It is encouraging that the Treasury 

Department’s new Office of Financial Research is working to improve information about this 

market, while the Securities and Exchange Commission is considering approaches to enhanced 

transparency in the closely related securities lending market.   

 Second, the risk of runs on money market mutual funds should be further reduced 

through additional measures to address the structural vulnerabilities that have persisted even after 

the measures taken by the SEC in 2010 to improve the resilience of those funds.  The SEC is 

currently considering several possible reforms, including a floating net asset value, capital 

requirements, and restrictions on redemption.  Clearly, as suggested by Chairman Schapiro, 

action by the SEC to address the vulnerabilities that were so evident in 2008, while also 

preserving the economic role of money market funds, is the preferable route.  But in the absence 

of such action, there are several second-best alternatives, including the recent suggestion by 

Deputy Governor Tucker of the Bank of England that supervisors consider setting new limits on 

banks’ reliance on funding provided by money market funds. 


- 12 - 


A third short-term priority is to address the settlement process for triparty repurchase 

agreements.  Some progress has been made since 2008, but clearly more remains to be done.  An 

industry-led task force established in 2009 orchestrated the implementation of some important 

improvements to the settlement process.  The unwind, with its reliance on vast amounts of 

discretionary and uncommitted intraday credit from the two clearing banks, was pushed to later 

in the day, reducing the period during which the intraday credit was extended.  In addition, new 

tools were developed for better intraday collateral management, and an improved confirmation 

process was instituted.   

Though these were useful steps, the key risk reduction goal of the effective elimination of 

intraday credit has not yet been achieved.  A second phase of triparty reform is now underway, 

with the Federal Reserve using its supervisory authority to press for further action not only by 

the clearing banks, who of course manage the settlement process, but also by the dealer affiliates 

of bank holding companies, who are the clearing banks’ largest customers for triparty 

transactions.  But this approach alone will not suffice.  All regulators and supervisors with 

responsibility for overseeing the various entities active in the triparty market will need to work 

together to ensure that critical enhancements to risk management and settlement processes are 

implemented uniformly and robustly across the entire market, and to encourage the development 

of mechanisms for orderly liquidation of collateral, so as to prevent a fire sale of assets in the 

event that any major triparty market participant faces distress.   

In the medium term, a broader reform agenda for shadow banking will first need to 

address the fact that there is little constraint on the use of leverage in some key types of 

transactions.  One proposal is for a system of haircut and margin requirements that would be 

uniformly applied across a range of markets, including OTC derivatives, repurchase agreements, 


- 13 - 


and securities lending.  Work is ongoing to develop globally uniform margin requirements for 

OTC derivatives, but there is not yet an agreement to develop globally uniform margin 

requirements for securities financing transactions.  Such a margining system would not only limit 

leverage, but—to the extent it is in fact uniform—also diminish incentives to use more 

complicated and less transparent transactional forms to increase leverage or reduce its cost.  

Some proponents suggest that such systems of uniform haircut and margin requirements could 

also dampen the observed procyclical character of many collateralized borrowings that results 

from changes in margins and haircuts following general economic or credit trends. 

Conclusion 

The shadow banking system today is considerably smaller than at the height of the 

housing bubble six or seven years ago.  And it is very likely that some forms of shadow banking 

most closely associated with that bubble have disappeared forever.  But as the economy recovers, 

it is nearly as likely that, without policy changes, existing channels for shadow banking will 

grow, and new forms creating new vulnerabilities will arise.  That is why I suggest what is, in 

essence, a two-pronged agenda: first, near-term action to address current channels where 

mispricing, run risk, and potential moral hazard are evident; and, second, continuation of the 

academic and policy debate on more fundamental measures to address these issues more broadly 

and proactively.
