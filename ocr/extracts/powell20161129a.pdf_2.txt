Thank you for the opportunity to speak here today.  My plan is to discuss the U.S. 

economy from three different perspectives.  I will start by taking stock of the current 

expansion--a business cycle point of view.  Then I will shift the focus to some of the 

longer-term challenges we face in coming years.  I will conclude with a discussion of 

monetary policy.  As always, the views I express here today are mine alone. 

The Current State of the Economy 

As you know, the Congress has tasked the Federal Reserve with achieving stable 

prices and maximum employment--the dual mandate.  Today, we are not far from 

achieving those goals.   

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has an objective of 2 percent for 

inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures.  The Committee sees this objective as symmetrical, so that minor 

deviations above or below 2 percent are treated alike.1  Inflation has consistently run 

below 2 percent since 2011, and is now at 1.2 percent over the past 12 months (figure 1).  

This headline measure of inflation has recently been held down by falling energy and 

food prices.  We also monitor core inflation, which excludes the volatile energy and food 

components because they often send a misleading signal about underlying inflation 

pressures.  Core inflation is running at 1.7 percent over the past 12 months.  Both 

measures have gradually moved upward toward 2 percent. 

U.S. inflation trended steadily lower after the Volcker disinflation of 1981 to 1982 

and has been low and reasonably stable for many years.  In fact, for the past several years 

inflation has run below policy targets in many parts of the world, including here in the
