Among students of central banking, the Great Recession will be remembered in 

part for the monetary policy innovation it prompted.  Since 2008, we have seen several 

episodes of extreme financial conditions in major economies.  In many countries, 

monetary policy has shouldered a large share of the policy response.  Debt-deleveraging 

dynamics and disinflationary pressures have confronted policymakers in several 

economies with the classic challenge of providing accommodation when constrained by 

the zero lower bound.  In contrast to the Great Depression, a number of central banks 

have found the “courage to act,” which has led to important policy innovation.  While it 

will take many years for rigorous research to distill the lessons from this period, I will 

offer a few preliminary observations.1 

The Effectiveness of Unconventional Monetary Policy 

For much of the period since 2008, many economies, including the United States, 

the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the euro area, and Japan, have been at or near the zero 

lower bound.  Many economies have experienced depressed aggregate demand and large 

and persistent gaps between output and potential, which have led to significant reductions 

in the level of policy rates in order to achieve full employment and target inflation.  

Moreover, the neutral level of short-term risk-free rates looks to be much lower now in 

many countries than it had been previously.  A lower neutral rate raises the likelihood 

that the requisite monetary accommodation when using conventional tools alone implies 

setting the nominal policy rate below zero.  With constraints on moving nominal interest

rates significantly below zero, central banks have looked to unconventional policy, such 

as asset purchases.  

The evidence suggests that unconventional monetary policy can be effective at 

overcoming the limitations on policy at the zero lower bound by operating through 

channels broadly similar to conventional monetary policy.  A number of studies have 

suggested that the forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases conducted by the 

Federal Reserve boosted the levels of employment and inflation at a time when the level 

of short-term interest rates was constrained by the zero lower bound.  For example, 

Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider estimate that the Federal Reserve’s forward guidance 

and asset purchase programs may have lowered the unemployment rate by as much as 

1-1/4 percentage points and increased the level of inflation by 50 basis points.2 

While conventional policy operates directly on the current and expected future 

path of overnight interest rates, and thereby indirectly influences longer-term interest 

rates, asset purchases are directly targeted at lowering yields on longer-term securities, 

which continue to have positive interest rates.  In the so-called portfolio balance effect, 

the asset purchases reduce the supply of long-term Treasury and agency securities 

available in the market, which leads investors to bid up the price of remaining securities, 

thus lowering yields across a range of financial assets.  Despite this difference, the 

channels through which asset purchases affect the economy appear similar to those of 

conventional monetary policy.  The resulting reduction in interest rates spurs investment

and purchases of consumer durables, lowers the exchange rate, and increases the prices of 

risky assets, such as equities.   

In addition, many have also emphasized an indirect effect through a “signaling 

channel.”  By helping to shape expectations about the expected future path of the federal 

funds rate, asset purchases help reinforce forward guidance.  Thus, asset purchases can 

affect longer-run interest rates by lowering the expected path of short-term rates as well 

as by reducing the term premium of long-duration securities.3 

Spillovers from Unconventional Monetary Policy 

Turning to the cross-border effects, just as unconventional policy appears similar 

to conventional policy in its domestic effects, the analysis so far suggests that spillovers 

from unconventional monetary policy work through the same three channels as 

conventional monetary policy does.4  First, when monetary policy in one country 

responds to a negative economic shock by easing, this action helps support domestic 

demand, which in turn will likely lead to greater demand for the exports of foreign 

countries.  Second, monetary policy easing can also lead to a depreciation of the 

                                                 
3 A number of observers have suggested that the market and macroeconomic effects of the initial asset 
purchase programs announced at the most intense period of the financial crisis may have been larger than 
the programs announced later in the recovery.  The initial programs were important in bolstering 
confidence broadly and supporting liquidity in financial markets.  The later asset purchase programs, 
particularly the flow-based program whose duration was tied to a substantial improvement in the outlook 
for the labor market, were important in signaling that the Federal Reserve was committed to taking all 
actions necessary to achieve its mandated objectives.

country’s foreign exchange rate, which switches domestic expenditures away from 

foreign exports.  Finally, it eases conditions across financial markets in that country, 

which can lead to financial easing in foreign markets when global financial markets are 

tightly integrated.   

The spillovers are likely to be more positive the greater the expansion of domestic 

demand relative to the expenditure switching effect through the exchange rate and the 

greater is the easing of financial conditions.  The magnitude of the relative cross-border 

effects from each of these three channels will depend on the size of the country that is 

easing monetary policy as well as its relative weight in international financial markets.  

Since 2008, changes in the stance of monetary policy in major economies have 

often elicited strong reactions in other economies.  Whether the global spillovers from 

changes in monetary policy were viewed as benign or challenging depends on the relative 

strength of the three transmission effects described earlier, the relative divergence of 

conditions in foreign economies, and the flexibility of their monetary policy tools to 

offset divergent spillovers. 

To illustrate this point, let’s start with a case where the effect of easing through 

unconventional means was broadly welcomed.  From 2008 through 2009, the Federal 

Reserve eased policy through cuts in its policy rate and through large-scale asset 

purchases.  That easing came in the context of a widespread global slump and severe 

strains in global financial markets, and in these circumstances it had significant positive 

international spillovers.  The boost to domestic demand likely outweighed any effect via 

the exchange rate and contributed to an easing of U.S. and global financial conditions.  

Those positive spillovers were reinforced by widespread easing of conventional monetary 


 - 5 - 

policies by central banks across the globe in response to the depressed state of their 

economies. 

In contrast, in 2010 and 2011, when the Federal Reserve undertook its second 

round of large-scale asset purchases, the global reaction was mixed.  By that time, several 

emerging market economies were experiencing economic conditions close to full 

employment and strong credit growth.  For many of the countries with divergent 

economic conditions, the combination of a market-based exchange rate and a firmly 

anchored monetary policy framework oriented around domestic objectives was sufficient 

to offset spillovers.   

Others, however, saw the increased capital inflows associated with the divergence 

of conditions as presenting problems for the management of their own economies.  One 

country in this category was China, which was experiencing an investment-led expansion 

accompanied by credit expansion.   

Separately, several emerging market economies with relatively flexible exchange 

rates, particularly those experiencing expansions because of strong commodity prices, 

saw risks from the combination of capital inflows and upward pressure on exchange 

rates.  Elevated inflows of foreign capital can present challenges in circumstances where 

prudential oversight and control of financial markets are not fully developed.  Thus, 

countries such as Brazil worried that heavy capital inflows could lead to an undesirable 

loosening of credit conditions and leave the economy vulnerable to rapid reversals.   

In the past two years, we have seen these concerns play out in reverse.  During the 

“taper tantrum” in 2013 and again in recent months, an increase in expectations of policy 

divergence in the United States confronted economic policymakers in emerging markets

with capital outflows and financial tightening against a backdrop of weakening economic 

growth and financial imbalances.  For these economies, while exchange rate depreciation 

can help offset weaker demand for exports and tighter financial conditions, it also puts 

upward pressure on inflation and may create problems for corporations with considerable 

foreign-currency denominated debt.  In the case of China, a previously set course of tying 

the renminbi to the U.S. dollar led to an appreciation of the currency from mid-2014 to 

mid-2015 in an economy that was already slowing.  Attempts to offset the effects of this 

undesired appreciation have had mixed results.   

Discontinuity around the Zero Lower Bound 

If the research is correct in concluding that the channels for spillovers do not 

differ, these episodes should have played out little differently for conventional policy 

changes than they did for unconventional policy.  That raises the question of why 

announcements of new policy actions around the zero lower bound have elicited such 

intense reactions.  The launch of the Federal Reserve’s second asset purchase program in 

November 2010, for instance, sparked a blistering response from several foreign 

policymakers.  One foreign finance ministry official was famously quoted as denouncing 

it as “clueless,” while others dubbed it the start of a “currency war.”  Officials from 

emerging markets with managed exchange rates argued that the United States “has not 

fully taken into consideration the shock of excessive capital flows to the financial 

stability of emerging markets.”5

The reaction was just as striking--albeit in the opposite direction--when the 

Federal Reserve first announced its intention to taper asset purchases in 2013.  The taper 

talk coincided with a broad reassessment of prospects in several large emerging markets 

in which some combination of financial, fiscal, and external imbalances had been 

building for some time.  Spillovers through financial channels were immediate despite 

the fact that the anticipated reduction in asset purchases in the United States was expected 

to take place gradually sometime in the future. 

My conjecture is that the widespread perception that unconventional monetary 

policy has large and disruptive spillovers may be a reflection of the discontinuity 

associated with discrete policy changes at the zero lower bound, along with greater 

uncertainty about the policy reaction function, rather than differences in the underlying 

channels of transmission.  When policy rates are in a range comfortably above the lower 

bound, most of the major central banks confront a relatively narrow range of options in a 

relatively familiar framework of decisionmaking and communications.  By contrast, over 

the past six years, decisions by major central banks to initiate asset purchases have 

neither been seen nor communicated as incremental adjustments, but instead as bold new 

initiatives whose cumulative intended scale, duration, or objective were announced at the 

outset, often against the backdrop of a public debate about the efficacy and 

appropriateness of various policy options.  

For example, in its first two asset purchase programs the Federal Reserve 

committed to buying $1.7 trillion and $600 billion of assets, respectively, while in the 

subsequent flows-based program it committed to continuing monthly asset purchases 

until the outlook for the labor market had met a target for substantial improvement.  


 - 8 - 

Cumulative asset purchases averaged a little over $1 trillion per program, which 

econometric estimates suggest contributed to sizable reductions in term premiums 

embedded in long-term yields and a downward shift in the expected path of the federal 

funds rate.  Similarly, in 2013, the Bank of Japan announced asset purchases at an annual 

pace of about 50 trillion yen and committed to continuing these purchases until inflation 

had moved up to 2 percent.  The European Central Bank, at the beginning of this year, 

committed to buying 60 billion euros of assets each month at least through September of 

next year, or until inflation is on a path to get to close to 2 percent.  In all of these cases, 

the policy actions themselves were large and designed to generate a significant easing in 

overall financial conditions, and the announcement effect likely was amplified because 

the policy reaction function around the zero lower bound was not well known and hence 

was difficult to anticipate.  

International Coordination of Unconventional Monetary Policy 

The intense debates over cross-border spillovers of unconventional monetary 

policy during the crisis naturally elicited calls for global coordination of monetary policy 

to avoid beggar-thy-neighbor actions that could undermine growth globally.  Recognizing 

the practical limitations of such proposals, in 2013, the Group of Seven (G-7) instead 

adopted a more circumscribed but achievable set of commitments.  Each member 

committed that its monetary policy settings--unconventional as well as conventional--

would be oriented to meeting its “respective domestic objectives using domestic 

instruments,” and “not target[ing] exchange rates.”6  This agreement ensured that actions

in the major advanced economies would be designed to provide accommodation targeted 

to supporting domestic demand, which would in turn support global demand--in contrast 

to classical demand-sapping beggar-thy-neighbor policies designed to shift demand by 

weakening the exchange rate.  The agreement to use domestic policy instruments to 

support domestic output and inflation objectives is likely, on net, to be an important 

constraint against beggar-thy-neighbor policies, especially in the less charted territory of 

unconventional policy. 

Implications for the United States 

Finally, it is worth considering what this implies for the United States.  While 

traditionally the United States is viewed more as a source than a recipient of cross-border 

spillovers, recent events have demonstrated that U.S. economic and financial conditions 

can be sensitive to spillovers from advanced economies as well as from major emerging 

market economies.  Over the past two years, we have seen divergences emerge among 

major economies in domestic growth prospects and the expected direction of monetary 

policy.  Earlier in this period, the focus was on heightened deflationary risks in Japan and 

the euro area.  The policy response to these pressures and the anticipated divergence 

between the policy trajectories in these economies and the United States contributed to a 

10 percent real appreciation in the dollar against a basket of currencies through the spring 

of this year.   

More recently, growth projections have been marked down for emerging market 

economies, which previously had been an important source of global growth.  Increased 

recognition of the risks to the outlook for major emerging market economies pushed the 

dollar up further to 15 percent above its level last summer and contributed to a more 


 - 10 - 

general tightening of financial conditions over the summer.  Much of the focus of 

investors and policymakers around the world has been on China, where the buildup of 

past property bubbles, and more-recent stock market, bubbles, together with a steep run-

up in business debt levels and questions about the policy framework, have raised 

concerns.  In turn, growth has slowed both in many commodity-exporting countries 

whose exports are sensitive to Chinese demand as well as many non-commodity-

producing East Asian economies that are tied to China through trade and investment and 

are important destinations for U.S. exports.  

The feedback loop between market expectations of divergence between the 

United States and our major trade partners and financial tightening in the United States 

means that material restraint to U.S. conditions is already in place.  Looking ahead, a 

further weakening of foreign growth could pose downside risks to the U.S. outlook.  

Under normal circumstances, policy in the United States could adjust to signs that 

spillovers from developments abroad were affecting activity in the United States.  But 

with policy rates in the United States at the lower bound, the ability to offset spillovers 

from adverse developments in foreign economies with conventional policy is constrained, 

suggesting greater caution than normal. 

In conclusion, the Great Recession has sparked innovative actions in a number of 

countries that have helped monetary policy escape the constraints of the zero lower 

bound.  Just as it appears that unconventional monetary policy can provide 

accommodation domestically similar to conventional monetary policy, so too it appears 

that cross-borders spillovers work through the same channels.  Nonetheless, the 

discontinuity of discrete policy changes around the zero lower bound can amplify the 


 - 11 - 

effects.  In response to heightened sensitivity around these spillovers, countries that have 

deployed unconventional policy have committed to do so in a way that targets domestic 

objectives using domestic instruments, thereby helping to ensure their actions would 

support rather than sap global demand.
