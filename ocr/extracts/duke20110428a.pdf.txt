The Federal Reserve is best known for its role in the national economy and 

monetary policy.  But through the 12 Federal Reserve Banks across the country, it also 

gets involved in efforts to support local communities and their economies.  This work 

helps to enhance our understanding of the pace of economic recovery and further creates 

a backdrop for a national dialogue about common problems and their potential solutions. 

Over the last several years, every community across the country has felt the 

effects of the financial crisis.  Foreclosed, vacant, and abandoned properties threaten 

neighborhoods nationwide, and community leaders are working to stabilize those 

neighborhoods.  While the problem touches every community, it doesn’t look the same in 

each because it’s shaped by the circumstances that prevailed in those neighborhoods 

before the crisis hit. 

Neighborhood stabilization efforts are critical, now more than ever, as not all 

communities will be stabilized without intervention.  This is because the market will not 

correct equally in all places.  Through the 12 Reserve Banks and the Board, the Federal 

Reserve System facilitates community development activities as communities strive to 

repair the damage wrought by the financial crisis.  We participate in local collaboration 

efforts, help evaluate what’s working and what’s not, and highlight promising practices.  

We do this by combining research and local outreach, and also by bringing together 

financial institutions, policymakers, and community leaders.   

Introduction of Three Federal Reserve Community Development Videos 

While the Fed conducts all kinds of research analyzing economic trends, we’re 

also looking for new ways to identify and showcase replicable models.  To that end, I’d 

like to share with you a series of stories we’ve produced that highlight various challenges

faced by communities and targeted strategies to deal with them.  Everyone has heard 

about the foreclosure crisis, but it helps to see what it really looks like.  So, we’re 

featuring three very different cities in a series of video reports that will be accessible on 

the Federal Reserve’s website.  These “Reports from the Field” showcase three promising 

stabilization efforts that highlight grassroots innovation and collaboration.   

Cleveland 

Cleveland neighborhoods face five decades of population loss, outmigration of 

jobs, and urban sprawl, in addition to the more recent wave of foreclosures.  Despite 

these persistent challenges, city leaders have responded with dynamic leadership.  In 

Cleveland, public and private partners have created an innovative stabilization strategy 

that uses targeted data to help community leaders focus scarce resources on the 

neighborhoods that have the best chance for success.  This is a model that has great 

potential to be replicated in other cities.  Let’s watch Cleveland’s story.

As the video highlights, Cleveland’s success is built around both on-the-ground 

community outreach and intensive data collection that helps to identify block-level and 

community-level trends.  It showcases strong collaboration among city and county 

officials; nonprofits like Neighborhood Progress, Inc.; local foundations; and universities.  

The Northeast Ohio Community and Neighborhood Data for Organizing (NEO CANDO) 

provides cutting-edge analytical mapping tools, and these data help steer resources into 

neighborhoods where the money will have the greatest impact.  This “tipping point” 

strategy relies on the comprehensive investment of public and private resources for 

sustained stabilization.

Phoenix 

The crisis looks different in western states.  Phoenix reminds us that the 

foreclosure problem has hit suburban as well as urban areas.  The vacant homes here tend 

to be newer than in many parts of the country, but overbuilding has left a high proportion 

of foreclosed homes in a community that has never dealt with these issues at scale before.  

Here, public-private partnerships have reached out to real estate professionals to help 

connect eligible families with affordable homes.  Let’s take a look at Phoenix.   

(Phoenix video) 

Given that the problem in Phoenix has largely been shaped by overbuilding and 

falling home prices, Phoenix faces a much different set of post-foreclosure crisis issues 

than older industrial cities such as Cleveland or Detroit.  In Phoenix, houses and 

sometimes entire subdivisions are often purchased by investors armed with cash and able 

to move faster than individual homebuyers.  The challenge for those trying to revitalize 

neighborhoods is to ensure that qualified homeowners and non-profits are in a position to 

compete with investors for these now affordable homes, and the city and private sector 

have come together to achieve this goal. 

Detroit 

While population growth may eventually aid the recovery in places like Phoenix, 

communities like Detroit are faced with the opposite problem.  In Detroit, the nexus 

between decades of population loss and the foreclosure crisis has created a pivotal 

moment in which the city must reinvent itself.  With extensive economic challenges and 

an infrastructure designed for a much larger population, few easy solutions exist.  The 

city is partnering with community leaders to bring together thousands of residents to help

make the tough choices that will shape Detroit’s future.  Let’s turn to Detroit. 

(Detroit video) 

As the video illustrates, Detroit is finding new solutions to the decades-long 

problem of stabilizing its neighborhoods and attracting new residents.  The Detroit Works 

Project aims to reimagine the city’s geographic footprint and service range, based on the 

current smaller population.  Detroit’s story reminds us that when ideas are controversial 

and hard choices must be made, community input and buy-in is critical for success.  To 

this end, the project has hosted extensive community meetings and created a leadership 

taskforce to map out future growth and investment areas. 

Conclusion 

At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to understand the issues, help craft 

national policies, and collect data that can be used by government agencies and 

nonprofits.  But sometimes a research paper or a speech doesn’t give you a true picture of 

what the foreclosure crisis really looks like.  When I began my role as a Governor, I 

travelled to the 12 Reserve Bank Districts to see firsthand what was happening across the 

country.  It was an eye-opening experience--one that has informed my perspective as a 

Governor.  And these stories from around the country can help provide the same type of 

context for researchers and policymakers. 

Here at the Federal Reserve we are learning more each day about the complex 

task of stabilizing communities in the wake of the crisis, and research and analysis of 

what is working is critical.  From these video “Reports from the Field,” we’ve learned 

that collaborations and partnerships help achieve success; strategic targeting of limited 

resources may be necessary; data can help focus a strategy; community input and buy-in

are critical for long-term planning; and different approaches will work for diverse 

challenges and places.   

The Fed will continue to identify the needs and challenges facing communities by 

fostering a dialogue for a better understanding of community development practices.  As 

the research conference unfolds over the next two days, we’ll learn more about what 

community development may look like going forward.  While research and evaluation 

remain central to the Fed’s contribution, the System is equally well positioned to share 

best practices and foster partnerships: connecting at the local level, building networks, 

raising awareness of successes, and using data and research to evaluate what’s working 

and to suggest improvements.  

We are looking forward to a lively conversation, and we thank you for joining us.
