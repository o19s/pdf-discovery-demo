I am delighted to be here in Jackson Hole in the company of such distinguished 

panelists and such a distinguished group of participants.   

I will focus my remarks today on forces--domestic and international--that have 

been holding down inflation in the United States,1 and some of the consequences of 

recent--primarily international--developments. 

Although the economy has continued to recover and the labor market is 

approaching our maximum employment objective, inflation has been persistently below 

2 percent.  That has been especially true recently, as the drop in oil prices over the past 

year, on the order of about 60 percent, has led directly to lower inflation as it feeds 

through to lower prices of gasoline and other energy items.  As a result, 12-month 

changes in the overall personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index have recently 

been only a little above zero (chart 1).   

The past year’s energy price declines ought to be largely a one-off event (chart 2).  

That is, while futures markets suggest that the level of oil prices is expected to remain 

well below levels seen last summer, markets do not expect oil prices to fall further, so 

their influence in holding down inflation should be temporary.  But measures of core 

inflation, which are intended to help us look through such transitory price movements, 

have also been relatively low (return to chart 1).  The PCE index excluding food and 

energy is up 1.2 percent over the past year.  The Dallas Fed’s trimmed mean measure of 

the PCE price index is higher, at 1.6 percent, but still somewhat below our 2 percent
