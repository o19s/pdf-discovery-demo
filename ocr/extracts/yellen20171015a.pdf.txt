I would like to thank the Group of Thirty for inviting me to participate in their 

International Banking Seminar and also thank Luis Alberto Moreno of the Inter-

American Development Bank for hosting this event.  My comments today will focus on 

U.S. economic prospects and monetary policy.   

Economic activity in the United States has been growing moderately so far this 

year, and the labor market has continued to strengthen.  The terrible hurricanes that hit 

Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico, and our neighbors in the Caribbean caused tremendous 

damage and upended many lives, and our hearts go out to those affected.  While the 

effects of the hurricanes on the U.S. economy are quite noticeable in the short term, 

history suggests that the longer-term effects will be modest and that aggregate economic 

activity will recover quickly.   

Starting with the labor market, through August, payroll job gains averaged 

170,000 per month this year, down only a little from the average pace of gains in 2016 

and still well above estimates of the pace necessary to absorb new entrants to the labor 

force.  In September, payrolls were reported to have declined 33,000, but that weakness 

reflected the effects of Hurricane Irma, which hit Florida during the reference week for 

the September labor market surveys.  I would expect employment to bounce back in 

subsequent months as communities recover and people return to their jobs.  Other aspects 

of the jobs report for September were strong.  The unemployment rate, which seems not 

to have been noticeably affected by the hurricanes, declined further to 4.2 percent, down 

about 1/2 percentage point from the end of 2016 and below the median of Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) participants’ estimates of its longer-run normal level.  Labor 

force participation continues to strengthen relative to a downward trend that reflects, in 


 - 2 - 

part, the aging of the population.  Other labor market indicators, including the rates of job 

openings and the number of people who voluntarily quit their jobs, also point to strength.   

Wage indicators have been mixed, and the most recent news, on average hourly 

earnings through September, was encouraging.  On balance, wage gains appear moderate, 

and the pace seems broadly consistent with a tightening labor market once we account for 

the disappointing productivity growth in recent years.   

I expect the labor market to strengthen further as economic growth continues.  

The hurricanes will likely result in some hit to GDP growth in the third quarter but a 

rebound thereafter, and smoothing through those movements, I’m expecting growth that 

continues to exceed potential in the second half of the year.  The latest projections from 

FOMC participants have a median of 2-1/2 percent GDP growth this year.  Growth of 

consumer spending has been supported by the ongoing job gains and relatively high 

levels of household wealth and consumer sentiment.  Business investment has 

strengthened this year following surprising weakness in 2016.  The faster gains partly 

reflect an upturn in investment in the energy sector as oil prices have firmed.   But the 

gains have been broader than that, and some measures of business sentiment remain quite 

strong.  Exports also have risen this year, as growth abroad has solidified and the 

exchange value of the dollar has declined somewhat.  My fellow FOMC participants and 

I perceive that risks to global growth have receded somewhat and expect growth to 

continue to improve over the near term. 

The biggest surprise in the U.S. economy this year has been inflation.  Earlier this 

year, the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures 

(PCE) reached 2 percent, and core PCE inflation reached 1.9 percent.  These readings 


 - 3 - 

seemed consistent with the view that inflation had been held down by both the sizable fall 

in oil prices and the appreciation of the dollar starting around mid-2014, and that these 

influences have diminished significantly by this year.  Accordingly, inflation seemed well 

on its way to the FOMC’s 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis.   

Inflation readings over the past several months have been surprisingly soft, 

however, and the 12-month change in core PCE prices has fallen to 1.3 percent.  The 

recent softness seems to have been exaggerated by what look like one-off reductions in 

some categories of prices, especially a large decline in quality-adjusted prices for 

wireless telephone services.  More generally, it is common to see movements in inflation 

of a few tenths of a percentage point that are hard to explain, and such “surprises” should 

not really be surprising.  My best guess is that these soft readings will not persist, and 

with the ongoing strengthening of labor markets, I expect inflation to move higher next 

year.  Most of my colleagues on the FOMC agree.  In the latest Summary of Economic 

Projections, my colleagues and I project inflation to move higher next year and to reach 2 

percent by 2019.   

To be sure, our understanding of the forces that drive inflation is imperfect, and 

we recognize that this year’s low inflation could reflect something more persistent than is 

reflected in our baseline projections.  The fact that a number of other advanced 

economies are also experiencing persistently low inflation understandably adds to the 

sense among many analysts that something more structural may be going on.  Let me 

mention a few possibilities of more fundamental influences.1

First, given that estimates of the natural rate of unemployment are so uncertain, it 

is possible that there is more slack in U.S. labor markets than is commonly recognized, 

which may be true for some other advanced economies as well.  If so, some further 

tightening in the labor market might be needed to lift inflation back to 2 percent.   

Second, some measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged lower 

over the past few years in several major economies, and it remains an open question 

whether these measures might be reflecting a true decline in expectations that is broad 

enough to be affecting actual inflation outcomes.   

Third, our framework for understanding inflation dynamics could be misspecified 

in some way.  For example, global developments--perhaps technological in nature, such 

as the tremendous growth of online shopping--could be helping to hold down inflation in 

a persistent way in many countries.  Or there could be sector-specific developments--such 

as the subdued rise in medical prices in the United States in recent years--that are not 

typically included in aggregate inflation equations but which have contributed to lower 

inflation.  Such global and sectoral developments could continue to be important 

restraining influences on inflation.  Of course, there are also risks that could unexpectedly 

boost inflation more rapidly than expected, such as resource utilization having a stronger 

influence when the economy is running closer to full capacity. 

In this economic environment, with ongoing improvements in labor market 

conditions and softness in inflation that is expected to be temporary, the FOMC has 

continued its policy of gradual policy normalization.  As the Committee announced after 

our September meeting, we are initiating our balance sheet normalization program this 

month.  That program, which was described in the June Addendum to the Policy 


 - 5 - 

Normalization Principles and Plans, will gradually scale back our reinvestments of 

proceeds from maturing Treasury securities and principal payments from agency 

securities.  As a result, our balance sheet will decline gradually and predictably.2  By 

limiting the volume of securities that private investors will have to absorb as we reduce 

our holdings, the caps should guard against outsized moves in interest rates and other 

potential market strains. 

Changing the target range for the federal funds rate is our primary means of 

adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  Our balance sheet is not intended to be an active 

tool for monetary policy in normal times.  We therefore do not plan on making 

adjustments to our balance sheet normalization program.  But, of course, as we stated in 

June, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestments if a material 

deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the federal 

funds rate.     

 Also at our September meeting, the Committee decided to maintain its target for 

the federal funds rate.  We continue to expect that the ongoing strength of the economy 

will warrant gradual increases in that rate to sustain a healthy labor market and stabilize 

inflation around our 2 percent longer-run objective.  That expectation is based on our 

view that the federal funds rate remains somewhat below its neutral level--that is, the 

level that is neither expansionary nor contractionary and keeps the economy operating on 

an even keel.  The neutral rate currently appears to be quite low by historical standards, 

                                                 
2 For October through December of this year, the decline in the Federal Reserve’s securities holdings will 
be capped at $6 billion per month for Treasury securities and $4 billion per month for agency securities.  
These caps will gradually rise over the course of the following year to maximums of $30 billion per month 
for Treasury securities and $20 billion per month for agency securities and will remain in place through the 
process of normalizing the size of our balance sheet.

implying that the federal funds rate would not have to rise much further to get to a neutral 

policy stance.  But we expect the neutral level of the federal funds rate to rise somewhat 

over time, and, as a result, additional gradual rate hikes are likely to be appropriate over 

the next few years to sustain the economic expansion.  Indeed, FOMC participants have 

built such a gradual path of rate hikes into their projections for the next couple of years. 

Of course, policy is not on a preset course.  I have spoken about some of the 

uncertainties associated with the inflation outlook in particular, and we will be paying 

close attention to the inflation data in the months ahead.  But uncertainty about the 

outlook is by no means limited to inflation.  As always, the Committee will adjust the 

stance of monetary policy in response to incoming economic information and the 

evolution of the economic outlook to achieve its objectives of maximum employment and 

stable prices.  Moreover, we are mindful of the possibility that shifting expectations 

concerning the path of U.S. policy can lead to spillovers to other economies via financial 

markets and the value of the dollar.  We remain committed to communicating as clearly 

and effectively as possible to help mitigate the risk of sudden changes in the policy 

outlook among market participants that could spur unintended effects in global financial 

markets.
