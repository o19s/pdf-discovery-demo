Good evening.  My discussion tonight will focus on a key transmission channel in 

an open economy--the exchange rate.1  The exchange rate is a primary focus of central 

bankers in small open economies as well as a prime concern of the broader public in 

those economies--and, to a lesser extent, in even the largest of economies.  When I was 

governor of the Bank of Israel prior to joining the Federal Reserve, my markets screen 

was continuously open at a chart of the exchange rate of the shekel against the dollar.  

For small open economies, the exchange rate may well matter as much for output and 

inflation as do interest rates.2 

Given that the U.S. economy is much less open than Israel’s, it is not surprising 

that fluctuations in the dollar typically receive somewhat less attention here in the United 

States.  Indeed, much of the focus on dollar fluctuations in the recent research literature is 

on transmission to foreign economies, including through balance sheet channels, as in the 

Bank for International Settlements paper (Hofmann, Shim, and Shin, forthcoming) that 

will be presented tomorrow.  Nevertheless, the exchange value of the dollar also plays a 

significant role in the U.S. economy, a role that has increased over time given growing 

global trade and financial linkages.  My remarks will focus on the consequences of the 

dollar’s ascent since last summer for U.S. output and inflation--and thus for monetary 

policy.   

                                                   
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on the Federal 
Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.  I am grateful to Christopher Erceg, Joseph 
Gruber, and Deborah Lindner for their contributions to this speech and to William English and David 
Skidmore for comments. 
2 At times, starting in the 1990s, several central banks--most prominently, the Bank of Canada--have used a 
monetary conditions index, generally a weighted average of changes in a short-term interest rate and a 
multilateral exchange rate from some baseline, as a policy indicator.

Size of Dollar’s Appreciation and Its Causes   

As seen in figure 1, the roughly 15 percent appreciation of the broad real dollar 

since July 2014 is large, though not unprecedented by historical standards.3  Two related 

factors appear to have played key roles in the dollar’s rise.  First, while the U.S. economy 

has performed relatively well--as is visible especially in our steady progress toward full 

employment--major foreign economies have generally experienced weak growth, along 

with persistently low inflation.  Because foreign central banks responded appropriately by 

providing additional monetary accommodation, foreign interest rates have declined 

relative to U.S. interest rates, encouraging investors to shift into dollar-denominated 

assets and in turn boosting the dollar.  But widening interest rate differentials can explain 

only part of the dollar’s large ascent.  A second factor has been heightened concern about 

the global outlook and an associated decrease in investor risk tolerance--factors that tend 

to increase investment in dollar assets.  In recent months, investors have been particularly 

focused on the possibility of a sharp slowdown in China and other emerging market 

economies, with commodity exporters seen as particularly vulnerable in the wake of the 

dramatic drop in oil and non-oil commodity prices since the summer of 2014.     

Effects of a Stronger Dollar on U.S. Activity and Inflation  

In considering the transmission of changes in the dollar’s value to U.S. output and 

inflation, it will be convenient for illustrative purposes to focus on the effects of a 10 

percent appreciation that is assumed to be permanent--and then to draw on this analysis to 

provide some guidance on how the dollar’s rise since mid-2014 has played out.  

                                                   
3 The broad dollar is a weighted average of the foreign exchange value of the U.S. dollar against the 
currencies of a broad group of major U.S. trading partners.  More information on the construction of the 
index can be found in Loretan (2005).

Because the main way in which a stronger dollar affects U.S. output is through 

causing real exports to decline, I will begin by focusing on the factors determining the 

export response.  Broadly speaking, an appreciation of the dollar reduces U.S. exports 

because it causes the relative price of U.S. goods to rise in foreign markets; for example, 

the price in yen of a U.S.-made pair of jeans will rise.  To gauge the quantitative effects 

on exports, the thick blue line in figure 2 shows the response of U.S. real exports to a 

10 percent dollar appreciation that is derived from a large econometric model of U.S. 

trade maintained by the Federal Reserve Board staff.4  Real exports fall about 3 percent 

after a year and more than 7 percent after three years.5  The gradual response of exports 

reflects that it takes some time for households and firms in foreign countries to substitute 

away from the now more expensive U.S.-made goods.   

A stronger dollar makes foreign goods cheaper for U.S. consumers and hence 

boosts U.S. real imports.  Nevertheless, an extensive literature has found that the degree 

of pass-through of exchange rate changes to U.S. import prices is low, as foreign 

exporters prefer to keep the dollar price of the goods they sell in the U.S. market 

relatively constant.  For example, a typical estimate is that an appreciation of the dollar of 

10 percent causes U.S. non-oil import prices to fall only about 3 percent after a year and 

only slightly more thereafter.6  The low exchange rate pass-through helps account for the 

more modest estimated response of U.S. real imports to a 10 percent exchange rate 

                                                   
4 The results presented here are taken from the staff’s U.S. International Transactions (USIT) model of the 
U.S. external sector.  A forthcoming article in the Federal Reserve Board’s International Finance 
Discussion Papers, or IFDP, Notes series will provide further detail on the structure and estimation of the 
trade block of the USIT model that is used in these computations.  
5 It may be useful to note that exports in 2014 amounted to about 13-1/2 percent of GDP and imports to 
16-1/2 percent of gross domestic product.   
6 These estimates are consistent with recent analysis by Gopinath (2015) and Bussière, Delle Chiaie, and 
Peltonen (2014).

appreciation shown by the thin red line in figure 2, which indicates that real imports rise 

only about 3-3/4 percent after three years.7   

Figure 3 uses these results to gauge how a 10 percent dollar appreciation would 

reduce U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) through the net export channels we have just 

discussed.  The staff’s model indicates that the direct effects on GDP through net exports 

are large, with GDP falling over 1-1/2 percent below baseline after three years.  

Moreover, the effects materialize quite gradually, with over half of the adverse effects on 

GDP occurring at a horizon of more than a year.   

In interpreting these estimated effects on GDP, it is important to underscore that 

the estimates do not take account of any offset due to monetary policy easing--a key 

consideration that I will discuss shortly.  Even so, recalling that the dollar’s actual 

appreciation has been about 15 percent, the model estimates suggest that the cumulative 

reduction in U.S. aggregate demand from the dollar’s appreciation is likely to total almost 

2-1/2 percent of GDP after three years--in the absence of policy action to boost private 

demand or government spending.  Given these perhaps surprisingly large effects, an 

obvious question is, how well has the model done so far in accounting for the actual 

behavior of U.S. real net exports?  While trade flows are affected by many factors that are 

difficult to capture in models--such as the labor disputes at major ports that occurred 

earlier this year--the drag from net exports over the past year does appear to be relatively 

close to the estimated effect implied by the staff’s econometric trade model, with net 

                                                   
7 In the staff’s trade model, imports are specified to depend on GDP in addition to the exchange rate.  The 
estimates shown in figure 2 simply show the effects arising through the latter channel.  Similarly for 
exports, the staff’s model also controls for changes in a trade-weighted aggregate of foreign GDP, with the 
estimates in figure 2 showing only the effects from a change in the value of the dollar.

exports reducing GDP by almost 3/4 percentage point in the data, compared with an 

estimated fall of 1 percentage point in the model. 

Looking forward, given that the effects of the stronger dollar play through 

gradually to the economy, there is good reason to expect that the drag on GDP growth 

from the stronger dollar will persist well into next year and likely spell continued 

weakness in the traded-goods-producing sectors of the economy that are especially 

exposed to the exchange rate.  Indeed, the more export-oriented manufacturing sector has 

already taken a hit during the past year and has experienced weaker growth than the 

broader economy.  

Turning now to inflation, consumer price inflation has been running well below 

the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent target, and the strong dollar has played an appreciable 

role in this shortfall.  One way in which the stronger dollar depresses inflation is by 

putting downward pressure on import prices.  Figure 4 uses an econometric model 

discussed in a recent speech by Chair Yellen to illustrate how a 10 percent appreciation 

of the dollar might play through to core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) 

inflation, which excludes the more volatile food and energy components.8  This particular 

model implies that core PCE inflation dips about 0.5 percent in the two quarters 

following the appreciation before gradually returning to baseline, which is consistent with 

a four-quarter decline in core PCE inflation of about 0.3 percent in the first year 

following the shock.  While the Board staff uses a range of models to gauge the effect of 

shocks, the model employed in figure 4--as well as other models used by staff--suggests 

that the dollar’s large appreciation will probably depress core PCE inflation between 

                                                   
8 This econometric model is described in the appendix to Yellen (2015).

1/4 and 1/2 percentage point this year through this import price channel.  Thus, given that 

core PCE inflation is running around 1-1/4 percent on a four-quarter-change basis, the 

stronger dollar has played a material role in holding core PCE inflation below 2 percent.   

A second channel through which dollar appreciation reduces inflation is by 

increasing economic slack.  Greater slack amplifies the downward pressure on inflation, 

although the quantitative effect is probably fairly modest given the flat slope of the 

Phillips curve.  Because the pass-through of dollar appreciation to oil and food 

commodity prices is much higher than for most imports, dollar appreciation tends to 

depress overall PCE inflation by even more than it depresses core inflation.    

An important difference between the transmission of dollar appreciation to 

inflation compared with output is that the effects on inflation are probably more transient.  

In particular, given that most of the effect on inflation occurs through changes in import 

prices--and import prices respond quickly to the exchange rate--the peak effect on 

inflation probably occurs within a few quarters.  From the standpoint of the outlook, this 

transience means that some of the forces holding down inflation in 2015--particularly 

those due to a stronger dollar and lower energy prices--will begin to fade next year.  

Consequently, overall PCE inflation is likely on this account alone to rebound next year 

to around 1½ percent.  And as long as inflation expectations remain well anchored, both 

core and overall inflation are likely to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium 

term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of declines in energy 

and import prices dissipate.

U.S. Monetary Policy and the Dollar  

The stronger dollar and some of the factors causing it, including weaker foreign 

demand, have played an important role in accounting for revisions to the expected path of 

U.S. policy rates compared with what was expected in the summer of last year.  The 

forecasts made by Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) participants on a quarterly 

basis, which are published in the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP), provide a 

good indication of the extent to which forecasts for inflation, output growth, and the 

federal funds rate have changed since the summer of 2014.  The June 2014 SEP showed 

U.S. GDP growth centered at roughly 3 percent in 2015 and core inflation running around 

1-3/4 percent, and the median participant projected that the appropriate level of the 

federal funds rate at the end of 2015 would be 1-1/4 percent before rising to 2-1/2 percent 

at the end of 2016.9  But in the most recent SEP following the September 2015 FOMC 

meeting, the median participant saw GDP growth at only 2 percent this year, core 

inflation at 1-1/2  percent, and the federal funds rate below 1/2 percent at the end of 2015 

before rising to only 1-1/2 percent at the end of 2016.10   

This greater degree of monetary accommodation seems appropriate given the 

adverse effects on U.S. aggregate demand coming from the rise in the dollar, an 

associated weakening of foreign economic prospects, and other developments that have 

restrained spending and kept inflation undesirably low.  Monetary policy easing helps 

through “crowding in” domestic demand, which in turn helps boost price inflation and 

makes it less likely that inflation expectations drift below our 2 percent target.

 - 8 - 

The Board staff’s general-equilibrium models that take explicit account of the 

ability of monetary policy to crowd in domestic demand--including the staff’s FRB/US 

and multicountry SIGMA models--suggest that monetary policy easing can substantially 

mitigate the effects of adverse shocks on GDP, including from the recent run-up in the 

dollar.  In the case of the dollar shock considered previously, these models suggest that 

the all-in effects of the stronger dollar on GDP are only about one-half to two-thirds as 

large as implied by the trade model that abstracts from a monetary policy response--still 

substantial, to be sure, but much less significant for the economy than if monetary policy 

failed to play an active role.  

Conclusion 

To wrap up, while the dollar’s appreciation and foreign weakness have been a 

sizable shock, the U.S. economy appears to be weathering them reasonably well, 

notwithstanding their large effects on certain sectors of the economy heavily exposed to 

international trade.  Monetary policy has played a key role in achieving these outcomes 

through deferring liftoff relative to what was expected a little over a year ago.  The 

October 2015 FOMC statement indicated that it may be appropriate to raise the target 

range for the federal funds rate at the next meeting in December, though the outcome will 

depend on the Committee’s assessment of the progress--realized and expected--that has 

been made toward meeting our goals of maximum employment and price stability.11  Of 

course, as policymakers, we must always be vigilant to events unfolding differently than 

we expect, and we must be ready to react accordingly.
