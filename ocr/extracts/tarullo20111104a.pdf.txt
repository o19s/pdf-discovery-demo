Long before the recent financial crisis, banking regulation had acquired an important 

international dimension.  The crisis renewed attention to the interconnectedness among national 

financial markets.  In its aftermath, accordingly, the international focus on banking regulation 

has grown even more extensive.  Today I will discuss three subjects germane to the increasingly 

significant international regulatory agenda.  

First are the steps needed to complete the reform agenda on capital and liquidity 

standards, including some implementation issues in the United States.  Second are areas that I 

believe should be priorities for international work in 2012--cross-border resolution of financial 

firms, wholesale funding markets, and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives reform.  And third are 

some institutional changes that will be required in the relevant international bodies to assure that 

they fulfill their promise of promoting a safe and efficient international financial system. 

Before turning to these topics, I think it important to state the goals that should inform 

U.S. involvement in international financial regulatory efforts.  In recognition of the fact that 

financial distress can quickly and dramatically cross national borders, we seek to protect our own 

financial system by promoting the adoption of strong, common regulatory standards and 

effective supervisory practices for large financial firms and important financial market 

infrastructures around the world.  Such standards and practices can also help prevent major 

competitive disadvantage for U.S. firms.  

Completing the Agenda on Minimum Capital and Liquidity Standards  

Strong capital and liquidity standards are central to these goals and to the overall reform 

agenda for financial regulation.  The crisis showed that liquidity problems can be an independent 

source of severe stress, perhaps even for firms that might otherwise have remained solvent.  But 

it also confirmed that capital standards themselves had been wholly inadequate in a number of 


‐ 2 ‐ 
 

respects:  Required capital levels were much too low, particularly trading book capital 

requirements.  In evaluating the condition of financial firms at the height of the crisis, markets 

focused on common equity ratios and virtually ignored the Tier 1 ratio enshrined by Basel I and 

Basel II.  Moreover, markets and supervisors both used a much more forward-looking capital 

calculation than under prevailing regulatory requirements--subtracting losses that they estimated 

would be sustained in an adverse scenario to determine whether firms would have enough capital 

to remain viable financial intermediaries.  Finally, the significant interconnectedness among 

globally active firms, and the high degree of correlation in their assets, underscored the 

vulnerability of the entire international financial system to the potential failure of these firms. 

In response to these revealed regulatory shortcomings, the Basel Committee has 

announced four sets of changes to minimum prudential standards for internationally active 

banks:  First, in 2009 it revised and strengthened the market risk requirements of Basel II, in 

what has become known as Basel 2.5.  Second, last year it issued Basel III, which improved the 

quality and increased the quantity of minimum capital requirements, created a capital 

conservation buffer, and introduced an international leverage ratio requirement.  Third, and 

coincident with Basel III, the committee issued a framework for quantitative liquidity 

requirements.  Fourth, it has just today released the rules text of its assessment methodology for 

determining an additional capital requirement for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs)--

popularly referred to as a “capital surcharge.”    

In the Basel Committee itself, work on Basel 2.5 and Basel III has been essentially 

complete for some time.  As reported recently by the committee,1 implementation of Basel 2.5

and Basel III into national legislation or regulations is at various stages of progress around the 

world.     

Two points are worth making with respect to U.S. implementation.  First, while U.S. 

bank regulatory agencies have published a proposed regulation for the new market risk capital 

requirements, we did not include the trading book securitization and resecuritization portions of 

Basel 2.5.  The complication here, and with part of Basel III implementation, lies in the use of 

agency credit ratings.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 

requires the removal of agency credit ratings from all regulations throughout the government.  

The banking agencies thus need to develop substitutes for agency ratings in each of the quite 

different contexts within the capital standards where they are used.  This has not been the easiest 

of tasks, but I believe we are now close to convergence on the approaches we will take in 

fashioning these substitutes.  Thus we should soon be able to draft a proposed regulation for the 

rest of Basel 2.5.  Work on the Basel III rule has had to compete for staff time with all the other 

rulemakings currently underway at the banking agencies, but I would expect a proposed 

regulation in the first quarter of 2012. 

My second point pertains to the six-year transition period for Basel III, which by its terms 

phases in the requirements for both the improved quality and increased quantity of capital in 

somewhat backloaded stages beginning in January 2013.  Questions have arisen--particularly 

here in the United States, though elsewhere as well--as to supervisory expectations for capital 

levels during this rather lengthy period.  Specifically, there has been some uncertainty as to 

whether supervisors intend to “pull forward” the various transition points outlined in Basel III.  

While the Federal Reserve intends to ensure that firms are on a steady path to full Basel III 

compliance, we do not intend to require firms to raise external capital or reduce their risk-


‐ 4 ‐ 
 

weighted assets in order to meet any target earlier than at the time specified in the Basel III 

transition schedule.  However, because this issue is complicated somewhat both by certain 

expectations stated in Basel III and by the relationship of Basel III implementation to the Federal 

Reserve’s requirement for annual capital planning by certain large bank holding companies, I 

think it may be useful to provide some further details on our expectations.   

In the first place, the Federal Reserve will require bank holding companies that are 

subject to our proposed capital plan rule (generally companies with $50 billion or more in total 

assets) to take affirmative steps to improve capital ratios, such as external capital raises, when 

those steps would be needed to meet each Basel III transition target on time. 

 Next, I would remind everyone of a statement made by the Governors and Heads of 

Supervision (GHOS)--the oversight body of the Basel Committee--in announcing agreement on 

Basel III in September 2010.  The GHOS said that banks should “maintain prudent earnings 

retention policies” so as to meet both the new minimum equity standard and the conservation 

buffer “as soon as reasonably possible.”2  In the spirit of that statement, we will expect large 

bank holding companies that have not yet met the fully phased-in Basel III requirements 

(including any expected G-SIB capital surcharge) to improve their capital ratios steadily during 

the transition period through prudent earnings retention policies, even if they already meet any 

applicable intermediate targets.  In practical terms, we will monitor their progress through our 

review of the capital plans that we require large bank holding companies to submit annually.  

That is, we will be comfortable with proposed capital distributions only when we are convinced 

they are consistent with a bank holding company readily and without difficulty meeting the new

Global Minimum Capital Standards,” press release, September 12, www.bis.org/press/p100912.htm.

capital requirements as they come into effect.  We will provide more detail on this point in a few 

weeks when we issue guidance and instructions for the 2012 capital review. 

Last, it is important to note that supervisors may require banking organizations to 

increase capital ratios above the minimum levels specified in Basel I and II for a variety of safety 

and soundness reasons.  Institution-specific measures of this sort are explicitly contemplated in 

both Basel II and U.S. banking regulations.  During the financial crisis, we used our safety and 

soundness authority to require banks to hold sufficient capital to weather the impact of the crisis 

and the serious recession that followed.  Similarly, our annual capital plan review is a forward-

looking exercise that, in estimating losses and reduced revenues that would follow an adverse 

economic scenario, may result in requiring banks to maintain more capital than would a static 

snapshot of minimum capital levels.   

Unlike the Basel 2.5 and Basel III capital standards, the quantitative liquidity framework 

requires further work in the Basel Committee.  The committee has developed two 

complementary liquidity requirements:  The Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) was designed to 

promote short-term liquidity resiliency of firms, while the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) was 

directed at medium-term structural liquidity mismatches.  The framework presented to the 

GHOS in 2010 was genuinely pathbreaking, in that it was the first effort ever to establish 

quantitative liquidity requirements.  Precisely because of the novelty of this exercise, questions 

were raised in the GHOS as to how the definition and calibration of the new ratios aligned with 

actual experience in the crisis, and whether the ratios might result in some adverse unintended 

consequences on financial markets.  Consequently, the GHOS agreed to delay implementation of 

both standards and provide for what were termed “observation periods,” during which further 

analysis will be done and changes very likely made.   


‐ 6 ‐ 
 

Here, though, it is important to draw a distinction between the two standards.  In 

recognition of the fact that the NSFR needs considerable work, which is not yet under way, it is 

not scheduled to become effective until 2018.  The LCR, on the other hand, will go into effect in 

2015.  The Basel Committee has recently agreed to accelerate its review of the LCR so as to be 

able to make changes well before that date and, thereby, give firms and markets ample time to 

prepare and, as necessary, adjust.   

In the coming months, the Federal Reserve, after consulting with the other U.S. banking 

agencies, will be making recommendations for changes in the LCR.  We have not yet finished 

developing those recommendations, but I expect that we will, among other things, suggest 

recalibration of certain deposit run-off and commitment draw-down rates, as well as 

modification of the buffer definition to place a greater focus on the liquidity characteristics of 

assets, as opposed to such things as the credit ratings associated with the assets.  We are also 

examining how the regulations might be best applied during liquidity stress events to maximize 

the benefits for financial stability.  Several other possible changes are also under consideration, 

including altering the LCR so as to limit certain arbitrage opportunities that appear possible from 

its current structure. 

Finally, let me turn to the Basel Committee’s framework for calibrating capital 

surcharges for banks of global systemic importance.  It is informed by the fact that failure of a 

systemically important firm would have substantially greater negative consequences on the 

financial system than the failure of other firms, even quite sizeable ones.  Thus, the surcharge 

attempts to reduce the chances of a G-SIB’s failure so as to bring the expected impact of failure 

of such a firm--that is, its expected damage to the system upon failure discounted by the 

possibility that it will, in fact, fail--more in line with that of other sizeable firms.  Moreover, the 


‐ 7 ‐ 
 

metrics for determining G-SIB status are heavily weighted toward the kind of interconnectedness 

features that pose macroprudential risks. 

This framework includes a range of surcharges in the 1.0–2.5 percent range for what will 

likely be a global group of about 30 banks, to be phased in as an expansion of the Basel III 

capital conservation buffer from 2016 to 2019.  The framework is consistent with the obligation 

of the Federal Reserve under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act to impose more stringent capital 

standards on systemically important institutions, including the requirement that these additional 

standards be graduated based on the systemic importance of the bank.   

For illustrative purposes, the Basel Committee used 2009 data to generate a list of banks 

that were of global systemic importance and, based on the criteria developed from that data, a 

hypothetical set of “buckets” associated with the different surcharge rates.  It is important to 

note, however, that this list will not be used to determine any bank’s surcharge. The list of banks 

to be covered and the buckets within which they will be placed when the surcharge begins to 

take effect in 2016 will be based upon data collected in 2014.  This is as it should be, since the 

inclusion and ordering of the firms should be based upon the characteristics of the banks as they 

have evolved closer to the effective date.  Some banks have changed their profiles materially in 

the past couple of years, and the prospect of capital surcharges may be an incentive for others to 

do so as well.  In this regard, I should also note that the bucket allocation of each G-SIB will be 

recomputed in each year after 2016.  

The use of more up-to-date data means that banks will not know for some time exactly 

which buckets they will occupy when the surcharge first phases in.  The Basel Committee does 

plan to release by the latter part of 2014 the thresholds for each surcharge “bucket,” as well as 

the denominator reflecting the universe of global banking institutions against which each G-SIB 


‐ 8 ‐ 
 

will be measured.  To further advance the goals of transparency and predictability, we will 

continue to work within the Basel Committee to ensure that the indicators used to determine the 

systemic risk ranking of a firm are clear and based upon publicly available information sources.  

If additional information is needed by firms to allow for effective capital planning, the Basel 

Committee should be prepared to develop and release additional guidance. 

Next Steps for the Reform Agenda 

As I stated earlier, strong capital and liquidity standards are central to an effective 

financial regulatory system.  Well-crafted capital standards provide a buffer against loss from 

any activities of a bank, while good liquidity standards help provide assurance that a firm will 

have breathing space during a period of financial stress, whether idiosyncratic or systemic.  But 

we cannot rely solely on these standards, important as they are, to provide a stable financial 

system.   

Basel 2.5, Basel III, and the G-SIB surcharges can only reduce the chances of highly 

disruptive failure, not eliminate them.  A necessary supplement is a strong resolution mechanism 

for systemically important firms, both to counter too-big-to-fail perceptions and to contain the 

harm to the financial system that would be caused by the failure of one of these firms.  Thus, my 

first candidate for a priority area of work in 2012 is to take concrete steps to advance the useful 

analytic work that has been done in the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) 

on the resolution of financial firms with substantial international presence.   

Here in the United States, the Dodd-Frank Act provides for an orderly liquidation 

process.  Some other jurisdictions have, or are planning to, put in place comparable special- 

resolution mechanisms.  But the co-existence of internationally active firms with nationally 

based insolvency regimes means that there can be potentially important transborder legal 


‐ 9 ‐ 
 

complications when a home jurisdiction places into receivership a firm with significant assets, 

subsidiaries, and contractual arrangements in other countries.  A comprehensive, treaty-like 

instrument for a global bank resolution regime is almost surely not achievable in the foreseeable 

future, and perhaps well beyond that.  But there should be room for more limited cooperation 

agreements, coordinated supervisory work on resolution plans, and other devices to make the 

orderly resolution of a large internationally active firm more feasible. 

Similarly, the limits of even well-conceived liquidity requirements suggest a second item 

that warrants attention in international fora--namely, the problems connected with wholesale 

funding channels over the last several years.  Broadly speaking, threats to financial stability can 

arise in two ways: first, through the rapid deterioration or failure of a large institution with 

leverage sufficient to produce widespread knock-on effects and, second, through the breakdown 

of a significant market in which large numbers of leveraged actors depend upon similar sources 

of liquidity and backup liquidity.  While these two sources of systemic risk can be, and usually 

are, related, the latter has not been the subject of the broad reform agenda directed at the former. 

You will note that the Basel III liquidity standards do not require global banks to reduce 

their usage of wholesale funding; instead, they require a bank that uses more volatile funding 

sources to hold more liquid assets.  This requirement is critical to a sounder financial system, to 

be sure, but it does not address completely the potential instability associated with wholesale 

funding--even in the regulated institutions subject to these requirements, much less in the rest of 

the financial system.  We will need further measures if we are to mitigate the risks of runs seen 

in 2007–2008 and, somewhat less dramatically, more recently.  Because the risk of runs in 

wholesale funding manifests itself in different ways in different countries’ financial systems, the 

appropriate response will likely be a mix of national and international actions, not an 


‐ 10 ‐ 
 

international agreement like Basel III.  But for this very reason, it is important that there be 

ongoing attention to the issue, in order to share ideas for action and monitor the steps various 

jurisdictions are taking to mitigate the risks.   

For example, we in the United States need to move forward with changes to money 

market funds and triparty repo markets to ensure that they do not serve as a trigger for wholesale 

funding runs.  We also need to address further the issues raised by the dependence of some 

foreign banking institutions on large amounts of wholesale dollar funding.  The responses to 

these issues may themselves involve a mix of national and international measures.   

 A third priority is the area of OTC derivatives, where strong capital standards alone are 

not enough to contain systemic risks.  We know that OTC derivatives dealers, as a byproduct of 

that business model, become part of a global network of interconnected exposures.  When one 

dealer in the network fails, as we saw in the case of Lehman Brothers, fear of losses at other 

dealers in the network can cause systemic stress.  Capital, which covers only a fraction of 

exposure, cannot alone prevent this contagion. 

To reduce the systemic risk of OTC derivatives, the Group of Twenty (G-20) leaders 

have agreed to mandate that standardized OTC derivatives must be cleared through a central 

counterparty.  Work in the United States is well under way to implement mandatory clearing.  

Other countries have begun this work as well, but progress abroad has been slow to date.  To 

help ensure that a global move toward central clearing of derivatives actually reduces systemic 

risk, it is critical that central counterparties in the derivatives market be very sound and stable.  

Therefore, it is essential that the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems (CPSS) and the 

International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) complete their important work 

on strengthening the oversight of central counterparties as soon as possible.   


‐ 11 ‐ 
 

To further build shock absorbers in the derivatives network, non-standardized derivatives 

that are not suitable for clearing should have margin requirements that are sufficient to prevent 

contagion when the next Lehman fails.  An international working group has been formed for this 

purpose.  We hope to see considerable progress on this element of OTC derivatives reform next 

year.  

Institutional Changes 

An audience of banking lawyers will appreciate the impact of the institutional features of 

international arrangements on the substantive output of those arrangements.  In the time 

remaining this afternoon, I cannot do justice to this subject.  But I do want to leave you with two 

observations about the international regulatory reform agenda of the last few years, along with 

some implications of those observations for desirable institutional changes. 

The first observation is that, although there are exceptions, the output of this agenda has 

largely consisted of what are essentially regulatory rules, intended to be applied to firms through 

national law.  Second, most of these rules are being generated, or at least reviewed, within an 

overlapping set of organizations and arrangements--the Basel Committee, IOSCO, the FSB, the 

G-20, and a veritable potpourri of committees functioning under the umbrella of the Bank for 

International Settlements (BIS).   

These rather mundane observations lead, I think, to some rather important institutional 

implications.  It goes without saying that the benefits of international regulatory rules will be 

realized only if they are implemented rigorously and consistently across jurisdictions.  Not only 

must they be incorporated into national legislation or regulations effectively, they must also be 

rigorously enforced by national supervisors.  We do not need formal dispute mechanisms similar 

to those in the World Trade Organization, which could undermine supervisory cooperation, but 


‐ 12 ‐ 
 

we do need effective, collaborative monitoring mechanisms administered by the supervisors 

themselves and reported to the public.  So, for example, the Federal Reserve has suggested that 

the Basel Committee go beyond the important function of reviewing legal implementation and 

also monitor how capital standards are applied within banks.  While a variety of methods could 

be used, we are particularly interested in establishing international validation teams to verify 

methodologies used at individual banks on such matters as the risk-weighting of trading assets. 

Even as the Basel Committee should monitor compliance with the standards it 

establishes, it must not lose sight of the importance of supervisory cooperation in pursuit of the 

shared goal of a stable international financial system.  The focus on rules and standards over the 

last few years has been both understandable and necessary, but the Basel Committee should not 

be purely a negotiating forum.  The activities of the Basel Committee in the 1970s and early 

1980s were largely informal, involving the sharing of supervisory perspectives and, perhaps 

more importantly, the establishment of relationships that could be drawn upon when cross-border 

supervisory problems arose.  I regret that these functions have been substantially attenuated over 

the years.  With the increased membership and expanded scope of activities, a return to early 

practice is not feasible.  But other ways must be found to foster the common goals of committee 

members in promoting safe and sound financial systems. 

The overlapping, sometimes competing, activities of all the international committees and 

arrangements is, like the recent emphasis on rules, completely understandable in light of the 

number of new and urgent issues to be tackled.  Similarly, the involvement of political officials 

through the G-20 was imperative to galvanize the legislative and regulatory processes of 

participating countries to undertake the breadth of needed reforms.  But as we move toward 

administering these new standards and arrangements, we must rationalize the often confusing 


‐ 13 ‐ 
 

and duplicative process whereby the Basel Committee, the FSB, and some other BIS committees 

are all involved in the same subjects.   

Fortunately, the agenda breaks down rather naturally into the new substantive topics, 

such as resolution and OTC derivatives, and the further refinement and implementation of 

established regulatory areas such as capital standards.  The new topics play to the coordinating 

and gap-filling strengths of the FSB, which includes both regulators and finance ministry 

representatives, and which can parcel out appropriate components of larger projects to standard-

setting committees.  Work in established regulatory areas obviously falls more appropriately 

within the province of the Basel Committee (or with respect to some securities regulatory issues, 

IOSCO), which consists of the regulators with responsibility for administering these standards 

domestically.  In this regard, it is important that the independence of regulators established 

domestically also be respected internationally.   

Conclusion 

The international dimension of financial regulation has grown even more important since 

the financial crisis.  Yet there are, as I have suggested, more subjects to be tackled.  At the same 

time, the pursuit of efficient and effective regulation requires priority-setting by, and 

rationalization of, the web of international arrangements dealing with these issues.
