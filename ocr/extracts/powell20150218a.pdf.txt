It has now been over six years since the most acute phase of the financial crisis.  

Over the intervening years, market structures have evolved, and financial firms have 

changed their business models in important respects.  Authorities around the world are 

implementing reforms that address the painful lessons of the crisis, while at the same 

time keeping the evolution of markets and firms in mind.1   

Today, I will briefly summarize this sweeping reform program as it relates to 

large, global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), critical financial market 

infrastructure, and money markets.  In my view, the basic agendas in these areas are, to 

different degrees, well developed, although a great deal of implementation remains.  In 

contrast, I will argue that thinking about financial stability in the context of credit 

markets is less advanced and presents difficult challenges for supervisors.  I will consider 

a range of factors that may address those challenges, illustrated with a discussion of 

recent developments in the syndicated leveraged loan market.  And I will argue that the 

standard for regulatory intervention in the credit markets should be higher than for the 

other three areas.   

Financial Institutions:  Even before the financial crisis ended, it was clear that 

reforms to strengthen the most systemically important firms and their regulation and 

supervision needed to be the first order of business.  I will mention four critical elements 

of that program.  First, these institutions are required to hold, and now do hold, much 

higher levels of higher-quality capital, as measured by both risk-based ratios and a much 

more comprehensive leverage ratio.  Under the “enhanced prudential standards” of the 

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank), the fully

phased-in capital requirements will be meaningfully higher for these institutions because 

of the greater threat their failure would pose to the financial system and to the broader 

economy.  Second, these institutions are for the first time becoming subject to rule-based 

liquidity regulation, including the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, the Net Stable Funding 

Ratio, and liquidity stress testing.2  These innovations are in part designed to address the 

firms’ vulnerabilities to damaging runs on their short-term financing, runs that occurred 

repeatedly during the crisis and clearly increased its severity.  Third, we now have 

rigorous, forward-looking capital stress testing that recognizes the dynamic nature of the 

financial system and guards against the excessive optimism that can build during a credit 

boom.   

These three reforms are well advanced and, in my view, have left the G-SIBs far 

stronger than they were before the crisis.  Together, they significantly reduce the 

probability of a large bank failure.  But they would leave us short of meeting the 

overriding objective of eliminating the too-big-to-fail conundrum without a fourth 

reform--a viable resolution mechanism that could handle the failure of these institutions 

without severe damage to the economy.  Until recently, no nation has had a way of 

handling such failures without that degree of damage.   

Authorities around the world have been working to develop an approach to 

resolving large financial firms that credibly imposes losses on shareholders and debt 

holders consistent with the basic tenets of our capitalist system, but does so in a way that 

protects the rest of the financial system and the real economy from severe damage.  The

single-point-of-entry approach developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

(FDIC) in conjunction with other U.S. supervisors is a promising innovation, especially 

in combination with the recent proposal of the Financial Stability Board to increase the 

“total loss absorbency capacity” of systemically important firms in terms of their total 

levels of equity and long-term debt.  When fully worked out, these new regulatory 

regimes should permit a large, consolidated entity that owns  banks or broker-dealers to 

continue to function even if the ultimate holding company ceases to be viable and must 

be recapitalized or wound down.   

As I said at the outset, these reforms directed at the G-SIBs are well advanced.  

But much implementation remains, including, most notably, addressing cross-border 

issues associated with the failure of complex global firms.  It will take time and continued 

international cooperation to complete this task.3   

Infrastructure:  The crisis exposed a number of important weaknesses in the 

infrastructure of the financial markets--what might be more plainly called the plumbing.  

Reforms aimed at addressing these weaknesses receive less public attention than those 

focused on the G-SIBs, and are in some respects less advanced in their conception and 

execution.  But they are, in my view, of great importance. 

I will mention two important sets of reforms in the U.S. context, one well 

advanced and the other still under development.  The first concerns the triparty 

repurchase agreement (repo) market, which is a principal source of overnight financing

Policy Objectives,” speech delivered at “Evaluating Macroprudential Tools:  Complementarities and

Oversight Council, held in Arlington, Va., January 30,

for the largest securities dealers.  Before the crisis, the functioning of this market was 

critically dependent on the extension of large volumes of discretionary intraday credit by 

two clearing banks.  When confidence in Bear Stearns collapsed in March 2008, the 

vulnerability of this market and its settlement procedures in particular became very clear.  

Today, almost seven years later, in no small measure thanks to the leadership and 

persistence of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the triparty repo settlement 

process has been substantially reengineered, with reliance on discretionary intraday credit 

essentially eliminated.4  In addition, a smaller fraction of the market now involves the 

financing of lower-quality collateral, and far less of the overall funding is provided 

overnight and thus subject to daily rollover risk. 5  Dealers in general manage their short-

term funding risk far more conservatively than before the crisis, including by carrying 

substantially higher levels of liquidity, in part because of the introduction of prudential 

liquidity standards that I mentioned earlier. 

Second, as I have discussed at some length in other venues, in the run-up to the 

crisis, the highly opaque and fast-growing market for over-the-counter derivatives gave 

rise to an underappreciated and largely invisible buildup of risk, which proved a major 

source of instability when the crisis broke.6  In light of this experience, authorities around

as discussed later.

the world agreed in 2009 that standardized derivatives should be cleared through central 

counterparties (CCPs), and that noncentrally cleared derivatives should be subject to 

minimum margin requirements.   

Central clearing holds the promise of enhancing financial stability through the 

netting of counterparty risks, creating greater transparency, and applying stronger and 

more consistent risk-management practices.  But this reform program will only succeed if 

CCPs, in which counterparty credit risks are concentrated, are strong enough to withstand 

severe but plausible stress scenarios, including, for example, the failure of multiple 

clearing members.  Achieving this degree of resiliency will require robust liquidity risk-

management practices, including the maintenance of substantial buffers of liquid 

resources that can quickly be tapped.  In addition, adequate loss absorption capacity is 

essential, including through substantial initial margin requirements and default funds.  A 

framework for such requirements has been agreed upon at the international level through 

the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures.7  Vigorous implementation at the 

national level is essential.  There is also a need for greater transparency for clearing 

members and the public regarding the risk-management practices of CCPs, for 

heightened stress testing, for consideration of “skin-in-the-game” requirements, and for 

credible recovery and resolution plans.  A great deal of work remains to be done to 

finalize and implement these additional reforms in all of the important CCPs around the 

world.

Money Markets:  Money markets involve money-like investments such as 

commercial paper and repo.  Investors in these markets include money market funds, 

corporations and other large holders of excess cash seeking a safe return in the short term, 

frequently no longer than overnight.  Borrowers in money markets include banks, 

securities dealers and other financial companies, nonfinancial corporations, and 

governments.  By linking investors seeking a safe return with borrowers needing short-

term credit, money markets do what commercial banks have always done, but without 

deposit insurance and other aspects of the safety net provided for regulated depository 

institutions.  After Lehman failed and the Reserve Fund “broke the buck,” money market 

fund investors realized that their investments were not as safe and liquid as “money” after 

all.  There were widespread runs in these markets, and it took a U.S. Treasury guarantee, 

augmented by a number of unprecedented liquidity facilities established by the Federal 

Reserve, to stabilize the money market fund industry and, more importantly, stave off a 

sudden stoppage of the flow of credit to households and businesses.   

This experience tells us clearly that disruptions in the money markets can threaten 

the broader financial system.  Regulation to increase the resilience of the money markets 

needs to reflect their systemic importance.  Some important steps have been taken to 

address the most immediate risks--for example, through the liquidity standards for large 

institutions I mentioned earlier.  But the risks associated with dislocations in the money 

markets go far beyond the large banks.   

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken some important steps 

to address the money market fund issue, notably through its 2014 rule amendments.8  To

address so-called repo runs, the Financial Stability Board is in the final phases of 

developing a framework of margin rules designed to be applied uniformly across nations 

for securities financing transactions involving nongovernmental securities.  These 

minimum standards should increase the resiliency of those markets and mitigate the 

pressures on terms that inevitably emerge during benign periods.  We expect to propose 

regulations implementing these rules in the United States in due course. 

Credit Markets:  That brings me to the credit markets, where households, 

businesses and governments engage in borrowing to fund their purchases and operations.  

These markets figured importantly in the crisis, most notoriously through securities 

collateralized by subprime mortgages.  The story is by now well known.  Lenders offered 

these loans to retail borrowers, often with negligible or simply fraudulent underwriting.  

Many of our largest financial institutions packaged the loans into marginally capitalized 

securitization structures that were rated highly by the credit rating agencies and thus 

generally viewed as suitable for purchase by a range of investors--including the most risk 

averse.  As conditions in the housing market deteriorated, the threat of significant 

mortgage defaults emerged in 2007.  The panic began in earnest when it became apparent 

that exposure to subprime mortgages was ubiquitous, from the balance sheets of key 

financial intermediaries and their supposedly “off balance sheet” vehicles to the 

investment portfolios of other institutional investors around the world.  Although the total 

losses were initially thought to be not so large as to threaten the system, some of these 

toxic mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were financed with the types of short-term, 

confidence-sensitive funding mechanisms I have just described, which amplified the 


 - 8 - 

dislocations once the run in funding markets began and caused great harm to the broader 

economy.   

As the crisis has receded, supervisors--not to mention market participants, 

commentators, and the general public--have eyed financial markets with a heightened 

sensitivity to anything that resembles the buildup of risks that occurred in the run-up to 

the crisis--a natural and useful exercise in pattern recognition.  In that spirit, the Fed, the 

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the FDIC have focused significant 

attention on the origination activities of depository institutions in the syndicated 

leveraged loan market, where some of the troubling patterns that were evident in 

subprime MBS have been observed.   

These conditions prompted policymakers first to ask questions and then to act.  

Fed officials raised concerns publicly as early as 2011.9  The Fed, the OCC, and the 

FDIC issued supervisory guidance emphasizing these concerns in 2013.10  In 2014, the 

agencies clarified the guidance through published FAQs and began to exercise intensive 

supervision at the largest regulated banks emphasizing the need to improve underwriting 

standards and credit risk management on safety and soundness grounds.11

The case of the leveraged loan market is an interesting one, because it sits at the 

intersection between core financial institutions and credit markets and illustrates the 

challenges supervisors face in thinking about intervention in credit markets.  I will turn to 

that market now in some detail.   

The term portions of leveraged loans are typically not held in the arranging banks’ 

portfolios, but rather sold to a wide range of institutional investors--collateralized loan 

obligations (CLOs), retail loan funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, 

and others (figures 1 and 2).  This “originate-to-distribute” model is now dominant across 

a range of markets and reflects the movement over several decades of credit 

intermediation from portfolio lending (from the firm’s perspective, the “storage 

business”) to the capital markets (the “moving business”).  This practice transfers and 

disperses credit and liquidity risks from the core of the financial sector to capital market 

investors that are willing to bear such risks for what they deem appropriate compensation.  

While the risks do not disappear, the system can, in principle, be safer if the ultimate 

institutional investors pose lower risk to the system than banks.  For example, movement 

of credit exposure to speculative grade firms from a bank’s balance sheet to a vehicle that 

is stably funded by sophisticated, deep-pocket institutional investors could be a net gain 

to financial stability.  Movement of such loans to a highly leveraged, runnable vehicle 

beyond the regulatory perimeter could have the opposite effect.   

Pre-crisis conditions in leveraged finance markets were, with the benefit of 

hindsight, clearly in bubble territory.  Deal leverage was at historically high levels (figure 

3), and spreads were at historic lows (figure 4).  Interest coverage ratios were quite low 

over a five-to-seven-year period; differences across industries and companies are also to be taken into 
consideration. 




 - 10 - 

(figure 5).  Unusually large leveraged buyouts were common.  Banks entered into very 

large, long duration commitments to fund deals that faced significant regulatory and other 

requirements before they could close.  Estimates vary, but when the crisis emerged and 

liquidity in these markets evaporated, large dealers were left holding roughly $350 billion 

in loans and commitments in their pipelines that they could not sell, and these positions 

remained on banks’ balance sheets for a time.  As loan values declined an unprecedented 

40 percent (figure 6), there were significant mark-to-market losses on these assets, which 

may have contributed to doubts about the condition of institutions at the core of the 

system.  Subsequent default rates were not outsized by historical standards, and recovery 

rates were in line with past averages (figure 7).  Of course, the Fed’s monetary policy 

eased financial conditions across the economy and enabled the refinancing of many of 

these loans at lower rates and with issuer-friendly terms. 

Because leveraged loans were generally not held in investment structures that 

used short-term, confidence-sensitive funding, these investments were not a principal 

focal point of runs such as those that plagued MBS funding structures.  CLOs were the 

largest institutional investors in leveraged loans, holding over 50 percent of loans 

outstanding.  These structures are funded with stable capital, with both equity and debt 

tranches committed for several years--a longer duration than that of the underlying loans.   

This picture of the pre-crisis leveraged lending market is one of a sharp decline in 

underwriting standards and a breakdown of risk management, resulting in a large risk 

buildup involving many of the G-SIBs--something the Fed and other regulators want to 

avoid.  Leveraged loans may not have been a material cause of the crisis, and leveraged 

lending alone would likely not have threatened the overall health of the large institutions.  


 - 11 - 

But caution on the part of supervisors is certainly understandable here.  It is worth 

remembering that the destructive potential of the subprime mortgage market was not 

obvious in advance and not fully reflected in real-time measures of balance sheet 

exposure.  In light of that demonstrated uncertainty, since the crisis, supervisors have 

opted to react earlier and more aggressively to the buildup of risk.   

Let’s now turn to post-crisis market conditions, which exhibit both similarities 

and differences compared with the pre-crisis period.  Borrowing through leveraged loans 

by speculative-grade companies has been brisk since 2010, with about $800 billion of 

institutional loans now outstanding (figure 8).  Over much of the post-crisis low interest 

rate period, demand for higher-yielding assets has been very strong, often outstripping 

supply.  Price and nonprice terms in the syndicated leveraged loan market have been 

highly favorable to borrowers, as credit spreads declined, albeit not to particularly low 

levels (figure 4), and leverage multiples increased (figure 3).  The share of loan 

agreements that lack traditional maintenance covenants increased to historic highs 

(figures 9 and 10).12 

CLOs and other stably funded investors continue to be the primary owners of 

leveraged loans.  But in recent years, mutual funds that invest in fixed income assets have 

seen large inflows and have become more significant investors in this market.  Some of 

these funds, including those holding syndicated leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, 

provide investors with what is called “liquidity transformation”--providing daily liquidity 

12 Highly accommodative monetary policy, while far from the only cause of ebullient credit market 
conditions, is designed to support economic activity by creating incentives to take credit and duration risk.

even when the underlying assets are relatively illiquid.  The risk is that, in the event of a 

shock or a panic, investors will demand all of their money back at the exact time when 

the liquidity of the already illiquid underlying assets deteriorates even further.  Investors 

may not anticipate or recognize this problem until it is too late--the so-called liquidity 

illusion. 

Bank loan funds, which attract retail investors and offer daily liquidity, now total 

about $150 billion, or 20 percent of institutional leveraged loans outstanding (figure 11).  

The liquidity transformation provided by these funds has not created problems so far 

despite recent outflows from bank loan funds, but supervisors and market participants 

have raised valid concerns that stressful times could well bring large-scale redemptions 

and threaten runs (figure 12).  Chair Mary Jo White has made liquidity concerns 

regarding open-ended mutual funds a priority for the SEC.13  

While it is possible to observe the characteristics of cash market investments, it is 

far more challenging to assess comparable positions in the derivatives and secured 

lending markets.  Investors may take highly leveraged positions in leveraged loans 

through total return swaps and secured funding transactions, and a substantial buildup of 

these positions could present run and fire-sale risks if asset values started to fall.  Today, 

the evidence suggests that such positions are fairly limited, but challenges in 

measurement and data make it hard to get a clear picture. 

While some of these conditions evoke the pre-crisis bubble period and thus raise 

red flags, there are important differences as well.  The large institutions that arrange these

 - 13 - 

loans have significantly reduced both the size and duration of their leveraged loan 

commitments (figure 13).  Thus, they are not exposed to the large “pipeline risk” they 

faced as the crisis broke.  In addition, banks now routinely limit their risk by including 

“flex” provisions that, among other things, enable them to increase the interest rate on a 

loan offered for sale by 150 basis points or more, at the borrower’s expense.  So far, we 

have not seen the very large transactions of the pre-crisis period.  In these and other 

respects, the leveraged finance markets have evolved, probably because of supervision as 

well as lessons learned by the banks themselves.  Given these changes, banks at the core 

of our financial system seem less likely to experience stress should conditions in 

leveraged lending deteriorate.  Of course, the guidance now stands in the way of a return 

to pre-crisis conditions. 

Let’s now step back from the leveraged loan market to ask the broader question of 

how supervisors should address a clear deterioration of credit market conditions.  I will 

consider three factors that are often discussed in considering the broader question of 

when and how to intervene in the credit markets to promote financial stability through 

institution-specific supervisory policy.14 

First, do conditions present a threat to the safety and soundness of financial 

institutions at the core of the system?   

14 This approach is consistent with the financial stability framework in Adrian, Covitz, and Liang (2013), 
and emphasizes the importance of leverage, maturity transformation, and common risks and behaviors in 
the financial system that can amplify credit losses and harm the real economy.  See Tobias Adrian, Daniel 
Covitz, and Nellie Liang (2013), “Financial Stability Monitoring,” Finance and Economics Discussion 
Series 2013-21 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), 
www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201321/201321abs.html. 
 
 
 




 - 14 - 

It hardly needs saying that we must to be alert to the buildup of risks in the credit 

markets that could undermine the safety, soundness, or solvency of the G-SIBs or the 

broader system.  If deterioration in one or more of the key credit markets would credibly 

raise such threats, the Fed and the other supervisors should react preemptively.  An object 

lesson in this regard is the damage done by the accumulation of excessive exposures to 

high-risk MBS and other mortgage-related assets in the years leading up to the 

crisis.  The originate-to-distribute model of mortgage lending on its face promised a 

social-welfare-enhancing distribution of mortgage credit risk away from banks and 

toward stable capital market investors.  But the banks remained profoundly exposed 

through contractual putback rights, mortgage and MBS litigation, residual balance sheet 

holdings, and implicit support to sponsored investment vehicles. 

Since the crisis, there have been significant and eminently justified legislative and 

regulatory actions to assure that mortgage originators follow minimum underwriting 

standards and that banks are better protected from exposure to high-risk 

mortgages.  These efforts include the Dodd-Frank risk retention rules and ability-to-pay 

standards, much higher capital and liquidity requirements, stricter accounting rules that 

limit off-balance-sheet treatment for sponsored vehicles, and a much greater supervisory 

focus on litigation and reputational risk.   

Second, is there use of run-prone financing by other investors that can lead to 

damaging fire sales? 

Supervisors should be highly alert to the reemergence in the markets--that is, not 

on the balance sheets of the large banks--of structures that are prone to runs and 

damaging fire sales triggered by sharp declines in asset values.  As I mentioned earlier, 


 - 15 - 

two different features can create vulnerability to runs and fire-sale risk.  The first 

involves funding of volatile assets with high leverage that includes short-term, confidence 

sensitive debt.  These structures were widely used before the crisis in the funding of 

MBS.  The second involves “liquidity transformation,” in which the investment structure 

provides investors daily liquidity, but the underlying assets are far less liquid and prone 

to becoming quite illiquid in times of stress.  Either or both of these features can be 

replicated in the derivatives or securities lending markets, which provide less visibility to 

market participants and supervisors.  Financial markets evolve constantly in response to 

market conditions, financial engineering, and regulation.  It will be important to keep up 

with trends in these markets that may give rise to this threat. 

Third, if left unaddressed, is it likely that conditions will risk meaningful damage to 

the real economy when the credit cycle turns? 

A positive answer on either of the first two questions should raise red flags for 

supervisors.  Let’s say, for the sake of argument, that the answers to these questions were 

negative.  One might still try to make the case for supervisory intervention into the credit 

markets to avoid the risk of meaningful damage to the economy down the road.  History 

shows that excesses that occur at the height of a credit boom can result in substantial 

losses not just to financial firms and market investors, but also to households and 

businesses, when that boom turns to bust.15 

15 See, for example, Moritz Schularick and Alan M. Taylor (2012), “Credit Booms Gone Bust:  Monetary 
Policy, Leverage Cycles, and Financial Crises, 1870-2008,” American Economic Review, vol. 102 (2), 
pp. 1029-61.   




 - 16 - 

The question of whether to “lean against” the credit cycle through supervisory 

policy--and when, and with what tools--is a difficult one.16  An important threshold 

question is whether supervisors will be able to correctly and in a timely manner identify 

“dangerous” conditions in credit markets, without too many false positives and without 

unnecessarily limiting credit availability by interfering with market forces.  Interesting 

recent research seeks to identify observable variables that could be used to monitor credit 

conditions and detect trends that could threaten the performance of the real economy in 

the future.17  This research is promising, and it could be used by supervisors to inform 

their thinking as it develops further.  In the meantime, unless there is a plausible threat to 

the core of the system or potential for damaging fire sales, I would set a high bar for 

supervisory interventions to lean against the credit cycle.  Such interventions would 

almost surely interfere with the traditional function of capital markets in allocating capital 

to productive uses and dispersing risk to the investors who willingly choose to bear it.   

Finally, another issue to consider when contemplating such intervention is that, 

particularly in the United States, activity is free to migrate outside the commercial 

banking system into less regulated entities.  As supervisory scrutiny has increased in 

recent years, a growing number of nonbanks have become involved in the distribution of 

leveraged loans.  Migration of this activity could be either a net positive or a net negative 

for financial stability, depending on whether it actually transfers risk irrevocably from the 

16 The U.S. banking agencies, following the lead of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, created a 
countercyclical capital buffer that could be activated during periods of excess aggregate credit growth.  The  
Basel proposal can both “lean against the cycle” and create a capital cushion to absorb losses from the 
likely increase in defaults.

core of the financial system, and whether the institutions to which activity migrates rely 

on funding that is stable and robust to fire sale dynamics.   

Conclusion 

To wrap up, I believe that sustaining financial stability requires supervisors to 

consider financial markets, in addition to financial institutions and infrastructure.  That is 

most obviously so when conditions threaten the safety and soundness of the financial 

system through leverage, liquidity transformation, or deterioration of credit underwriting 

or other risk-management standards.  At the same time, financial stability need not seek 

to eliminate all risks.  We need to learn, but not overlearn, the lessons of the crisis.  I 

believe there should be a high bar for “leaning against the credit cycle” in the absence of 

credible threats to the core or the reemergence of run-prone funding structures.  In my 

view, the Fed and other prudential and market regulators should resist interfering with the 

role of markets in allocating capital to issuers and risk to investors unless the case for 

doing so is strong and the available tools can achieve the objective in a targeted manner 

and with a high degree of confidence.
