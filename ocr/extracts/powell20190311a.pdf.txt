Brief Remarks  
(via prerecorded video) 

by 

Jerome H. Powell 

Chair 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

“Just Economy Conference”  
sponsored by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition 

Washington, D.C. 

March 11, 2019 


Good evening, and thank you for inviting me to speak to you today. 

The National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC) and its member 

organizations are at the forefront of an important conversation about how to ensure that 

low- and moderate-income communities are fairly served by the banking industry.  The 

work that you do to promote access to basic banking services, affordable housing, and 

entrepreneurship opportunities supports the Federal Reserve and other agencies that 

enforce fair lending laws.  The large number and variety of NCRC’s local member 

organizations allow the NCRC to draw a detailed picture of how the Federal Reserve’s 

policies affect lower-income communities, and we deeply appreciate the information that 

you share with us and the work that it represents.   

As you know all too well, the current strength of the overall economy masks the 

struggles many individuals and families face in lower-income urban and rural 

communities.  Low- and moderate-income homeowners saw their wealth stripped away 

as home values dropped during the financial crisis and have not recovered as quickly or 

completely as others.  Because home equity has been the main source of wealth among 

low- and moderate-income people, the crisis dealt a particularly severe blow to these 

households.  Most Americans rely on home equity to send their children to college, invest 

in their own education and training, or start or grow a business.  These aspirations are the 

basis upon which a strong economy is built.  That is why your work as NCRC member 

organizations offering financial counseling, homeownership education, and technical 

assistance for small businesses is as important as ever.

When lower-income individuals and families struggle, it harms their health and 

well-being and also weakens our economy.  When people are connected to education, 

training, and other resources that help them secure good jobs and other opportunities, 

they are better prepared to care for themselves and their families and contribute to a 

strong economy.   

The Federal Reserve has an extensive community development function, related 

to our responsibilities under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), that promotes 

partnerships between banks and community organizations to address local community 

and economic development needs.  As you know, the CRA requires federal banking 

regulators--the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs 

of the communities they are chartered to serve, including low- and moderate-income 

neighborhoods.  To complement the work we do with the other regulators to write 

regulations and guidance implementing CRA, the Federal Reserve System’s community 

development staff help banks understand and meet their responsibilities under the law.  

Fed staff members also act as liaisons between banks and community organizations to 

identify local community development needs and solutions.   

I know that you all are very interested in the agencies’ activities related to 

possible revisions to the current CRA regulations.  My colleague, Governor Brainard, 

who represents the Board in our interagency CRA discussions, will be speaking to you 

tomorrow, so I will leave it to her to discuss our efforts in detail.  But I do want to 

express my support for an interagency effort to revise the regulations to promote clarity 

and consistency in our evaluations of banks, particularly in light of the changes in the

way bank products and services are delivered.  We value the CRA’s role in meeting the 

credit needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and want to be very careful 

that any revisions serve to strengthen the CRA’s purpose.  

I commend your dedication to ensuring that all Americans have fair access to the 

economic opportunities that our nation offers.  I hope you have a productive conference, 

and I look forward to our ongoing conversation about how the Federal Reserve can help.
