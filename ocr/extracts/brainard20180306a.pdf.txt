I appreciate the invitation from the Money Marketeers to discuss the path ahead for 

our economy and monetary policy.1 

Many of the forces that acted as headwinds to U.S. growth and weighed on policy 

in previous years are generating tailwinds currently.  Today many economies around the 

world are experiencing synchronized growth, in contrast to the 2015–16 period when 

important foreign economies experienced adverse shocks and anemic demand.  The 

International Monetary Fund revised up its outlook for the world economy in January, 

continuing a recent pattern of upward revisions, in contrast to a string of downward 

revisions in 2015 and 2016.2  Stronger economies abroad should increase demand for 

America’s exports and boost the foreign earnings of U.S. companies. 

The upward revisions to the foreign economic outlook are also pulling forward 

expectations of monetary policy tightening abroad and contributing to an appreciation of 

foreign currencies and increases in U.S. import prices.  By contrast, foreign currencies 

weakened in the earlier period, pushing the dollar higher and U.S. import prices lower.  

Since the end of 2016, a broad index of the exchange value of the dollar has depreciated 

nearly 8 percent, whereas it appreciated by 25 percent from mid-2014 to 2016.   

In recent quarters, the combination of higher oil prices and robust global demand 

has been providing strong support to business investment--in contrast to the sharp pullback 

from 2015 to 2016.  Business spending on fixed investment rose at more than a 6 percent

pace in 2017.  This rise followed two years of weak growth, dragged down by declines in 

the drilling and mining sector.  

Financial conditions are currently supportive of economic growth despite the recent 

choppiness in financial markets and some tightening since the beginning of the year.  

Various measures of equity valuations remain elevated relative to historical norms even 

after recent movements, and corporate bond spreads remain quite compressed.3  This 

compares with the period from mid-2014 through the second half of 2016, when equity 

prices were flat and the dollar rose steeply.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s 

National Financial Conditions Index provides a useful summary statistic.4  According to 

this measure, financial conditions tightened significantly from the middle of 2014 to early 

2016.  By comparison, financial conditions today remain near the accommodative end of 

the range since the financial crisis, even with the recent tightening in conditions.  

The most notable tailwind is the shift in America’s fiscal policy stance from 

restraint to substantial stimulus in an economy close to full employment.  In the earlier 

period, the economy had just weathered a challenging adjustment to a sharp withdrawal of 

fiscal support.  Today, from a position near full employment, the economy is poised to 

absorb $1-1/2 trillion in personal and corporate tax cuts and a $300 billion increase in 

federal spending.  Estimates suggest December’s tax legislation could boost the growth rate 

of real gross domestic product (GDP) as much as 1/2 percentage point this year and next.5

4 The National Financial Conditions Index is available on the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago’s website at 
https://www.chicagofed.org/publications/nfci/index.  Other indexes of financial conditions, such as the 
indexes published by the Federal Reserve Banks of Kansas City and St. Louis, tell a similar story. 
5 For example, the IMF 2018 WEO Updates (see note 2) estimates that the tax cut legislation will raise the 
level of U.S. GDP 1-1/4 percent by 2020.

On top of that, the recently agreed-to budget deal is likely to raise federal spending by 

around 0.4 percent of GDP in each of the next two years.6 

Achieving Our Inflation Objective and Sustaining Full Employment 

Although the economy is currently around full employment and has been expanding 

at an above-trend pace, inflation has remained subdued for quite some time.  Over the past 

year, overall PCE (personal consumption expenditures) inflation was 1.7 percent, and core 

PCE inflation was 1.5 percent--not very different from the average level of core inflation 

over the past five years. 

The persistence of subdued inflation, despite an unemployment rate that has moved 

below most estimates of its natural rate, suggests some risk that underlying inflation may 

have softened.  While transitory factors no doubt played a role in last year’s step-down in 

core PCE inflation, various empirical analyses conclude that persistent factors are at play in 

the stubbornly low level of core inflation.  According to a variety of measures, underlying 

inflation--the slow-moving trend that exerts a pull on wage and price setting--may be 

running below levels that are consistent with the Federal Open Market Committee’s 

(FOMC) 2 percent inflation objective.7  For example, some survey measures of longer-run 

inflation expectations are currently lower than they were before the financial crisis, as are 

most estimates based on statistical filters.  Inflation compensation has moved up recently, 

but is still running somewhat below levels that prevailed before the crisis.   

                                                 
6 The Congressional Budget Office (2018) estimates that increased spending caps will allow additional 
spending worth about 3/4 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2019.

Thus, it is important for monetary policy to ensure that underlying inflation is re-

anchored firmly at 2 percent.  At the same time, it is important for monetary policy to 

sustain full employment.   

It is difficult to know with precision how much slack remains in the labor market.  

If the unemployment rate were to continue to fall in the coming year at the same pace as in 

the past couple of years, it would reach levels not seen since the late 1960s.  On the other 

hand, the employment-to-population ratio for prime-age workers remains more than 

1 percentage point below its pre-crisis level.  If substantially more workers could be drawn 

into the labor force, it would be possible for the labor market to firm notably further 

without generating imbalances.  But it is an open question as to what portion of the prime-

age Americans who are out of the labor force may prove responsive to tight labor market 

conditions because declining labor force participation among prime-age workers predates 

the crisis, especially for men.  In one encouraging development, the strong labor market has 

pulled some discouraged workers back into the labor force and into productive employment 

over the past few years.  Also encouraging, our Beige Book and workforce surveys indicate 

that employers are casting a wider net to find job candidates and investing more in on-the-

job training.  

Navigating Monetary Policy  

Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in 

the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full 

employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view.  With 

greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the 

federal funds rate are likely to be appropriate.

Although experience in other countries suggests it can prove difficult to raise an 

underlying inflation trend that has been running below policymakers’ target for several 

years, stronger tailwinds may help re-anchor inflation expectations at the symmetric 

2 percent objective.  Of course, it is conceivable we could see a mild, temporary overshoot 

of the inflation target over the medium term.  If such a mild, temporary overshoot were to 

occur, it would likely be consistent with the symmetry of the FOMC’s target and could 

help nudge underlying inflation back to our target.8  Recent research has highlighted the 

downside risks to inflation and to longer-run inflation expectations that are posed by the 

effective lower bound on nominal interest rates, and it suggests the importance of ensuring 

underlying inflation does not slip below target in today’s new normal.9  

We also seek to sustain full employment, and we will want to be attentive to 

imbalances that could jeopardize this goal.  If the unemployment rate continues to decline 

on the current trajectory, it could fall to levels that have been rarely seen over the past five 

decades.  Historically, such episodes have tended to see elevated risks of imbalances, 

whether in the form of high inflation in earlier decades or of financial imbalances in recent 

decades.  One of the striking features of the current recovery has been the absence of an 

acceleration in inflation as the unemployment rate has declined, a development that is 

consistent with a flat Phillips curve.10  Although wage gains have seen some recent 

improvements, they continue to fall short of the pace seen before the financial crisis.11

11 Over the 12 months through January, average hourly earnings were up 2.9 percent relative to a year earlier, 
the highest 12-month change in almost nine years.  The employment cost index rose 2.6 percent last year.

However, we do not have extensive experience with an economy at very low 

unemployment rates and cannot be sure how it might evolve.  In particular, we will want to 

remain attentive to the risk of financial imbalances.  While asset valuations appear to be 

elevated, overall risks to the financial system remain moderate because household 

borrowing is moderate, risks associated with liquidity and maturity transformation have 

declined, and, importantly, the banking system appears to be well capitalized.12  History 

suggests, however, that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards, 

and the attendant excessive borrowing can complicate the task of monetary policy.  We will 

need to be vigilant. 

Conclusion 

What do these considerations imply for the path of monetary policy?  Continued 

gradual increases in the federal funds rate are likely to remain appropriate to ensure 

inflation rises sustainably to our target and to sustain full employment, keeping in mind that 

interest rate normalization is well under way and balance sheet runoff is set to reach its 

steady-state pace later this year.13  Of course, we should be ready to adjust the path of 

policy in either direction if developments turn out differently than expected.   

In many respects, the macro environment today is the mirror image of the 

environment we confronted a couple of years ago.  In the earlier period, strong headwinds 

sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy.  Today, with 

headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.

13 As laid out in Board of Governors (2017), the caps determining the degree of reinvestment of maturing 
securities in the System Open Market Account are increasing gradually.  The caps on the monthly runoff in 
the portfolio are expected to reach their maximum levels of $30 billion for Treasury securities and $20 billion 
for agency debt and mortgage-backed securities later this year.  The actual pace of runoff will vary, however, 
depending on the volume of securities maturing in any given month.
