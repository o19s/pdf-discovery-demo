Good afternoon.  I am pleased to participate in the Cleveland Clinic’s “Ideas for 

Tomorrow” series.  My public remarks often concern short-run economic developments, 

but it is important once in a while to place those shorter-term developments in the context 

of the powerful long-term trends shaping the global economy.  Of these trends, surely one 

of the most important is the rapid and sustained economic growth achieved by the 

emerging market economies.  Today, by some measures at least, developing and 

emerging market economies now account for more than one-half of global economic 

activity, up substantially from less than one-third in 1980.1  Today I will discuss what the 

experience of the emerging markets teaches us about the sources of economic growth and 

conclude with some thoughts about the prospects for future growth in this critical part of 

the global economy. 

Among the emerging market economies, the Asian “growth miracle” is, of course, 

the most conspicuous success story, with the case of China being particularly dramatic.  

Over the past three decades, growth in Chinese output per person has averaged roughly 

9 percent a year, putting per capita output about 13 times higher now than in 1980.  The 

economy of Korea, another East Asian success story, has expanded, on average, at better 

than a 6 percent annual rate over the past 30 years.  Growth in Latin America has been 

more moderate, but that continent has made substantial economic progress as well, most 

notably in terms of lower inflation and greater economic stability.  More recently, the

valuation of a country’s GDP based on purchasing power parity exchange rates.  The emerging market and 
developing economies group used here includes the IMF’s classification of newly industrialized Asian 
economies.  There is no consensus definition of emerging economies, as contrasted with developing 
economies, but generally speaking, emerging market economies are defined as those economies in the low- 
to middle-income category that are advancing rapidly and are integrating with global capital and product 
markets.  Emerging economies account for most of the rise in the share of the developing and emerging 
economies in global output, and they are the focus of this speech.

pace of recovery in most emerging market economies from the global financial crisis has 

been impressive.  In short, in the past few decades the emerging market economies have 

made significant strides in raising living standards.  Hundreds of millions of people have 

benefited from this progress, with many millions lifted out of poverty.2  To be sure, the 

gap with the advanced economies remains substantial, but it has been narrowed 

significantly.  

These developments raise the question:  How have the emerging market 

economies achieved such strong results in recent decades?  The answer is complex, of 

course, and I can only scratch the surface of these issues today; but I hope to lay out some 

key themes and provide some food for thought. 

Fostering Growth in Developing Economies:  The Washington Consensus 

Ironically, the rapid growth of the emerging market economies reflects in part the 

low levels of development at which they began.  In the economic-growth derby, in 

contrast to most types of competitions, starting from far behind has its advantages.  For 

example, all else being equal, domestic and foreign investors are attracted to the higher 

returns they receive from investments where capital is relatively scarce, as is generally 

the case in poorer countries.  In the 19th century, the United States drew capital from all 

over the world to finance railroad construction; although not all of these investments paid 

off, overall they helped generate enormous increases in wealth by reducing transport 

costs and fostering economic integration within the North American continent.  Similarly, 

emerging market economies in recent decades have attracted substantial foreign 

investment in new manufacturing capacity, in part to take advantage of low labor costs.  

                                                            
2 According to data from World Bank Development Indicators, 2011, there were more than 500 million 
fewer people living below the $1.25 a day poverty line in 2005 than 25 years earlier.

Developing countries also have the advantage of being able to import and adapt 

production technologies already in use in advanced economies.  And, indeed, empirical 

studies have found some tendency for countries that start from further behind to grow 

faster than those that begin with higher incomes.3  

However, much of the national and regional variation in growth rates is not 

explained by initial economic conditions.  Notably, emerging Asian economies have 

tended to outperform, relative to what would be predicted based solely on their levels of 

income per person, say, 30 years ago.  And some of the poorest countries, including a 

number in Africa, have continued to grow relatively slowly.  So what factors--and what 

economic policies--differentiate the more successful performers from the less successful? 

A classic attempt to generalize about the policies that best promote economic 

growth and development, and a useful starting point for discussion, is the so-called 

Washington Consensus, articulated by the economist John Williamson in 1990.4  Writing 

about Latin America, Williamson outlined a list of 10 broad policies to promote 

economic development that he judged as commanding, at the time he wrote, substantial 

support between both economists and policymakers.  Because these views were 

influential at major institutions like the World Bank located in Washington, this set of 

policies was dubbed the Washington Consensus. 
                                                            
3 The idea that levels of output per capita tend to converge across countries, which in turn implies that the 
countries that are initially the poorest tend to grow the fastest, is known in the research literature as 
“absolute convergence.”  A more sophisticated variant of this idea is “conditional convergence,” which 
holds that convergence across countries holds only after we control appropriately for factors that affect the 
long-run level of output in each country, such as the domestic saving rate and the rate of population growth.  
Empirical analyses generally find somewhat mixed evidence for absolute convergence but fairly robust 
support for conditional convergence.  See, for example, Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2004) and Durlauf, 
Johnson, and Temple (2005).  Rodrik (2011) and some others have argued recently that absolute 
convergence holds at a more disaggregated level in the manufacturing sector.     
4 Williamson initially articulated the Washington Consensus in a speech in 1989, but the first written 
version appears in Williamson (1990).  See also Williamson (2004) for his views on the various 
interpretations given to his recommendations.

Williamson’s original list of recommendations can usefully be divided into three 

categories:  first, steps to increase macroeconomic stability, such as reducing fiscal 

deficits (which had caused high inflation in many countries), broadening the tax base, and 

reallocating government resources to build human and physical capital; second, actions to 

increase the role of markets in the economy, such as privatization of public assets, 

appropriate deregulation, and the liberalization of trade, interest rates, and capital flows; 

and third, efforts to strengthen institutions that promote investment, business formation, 

and growth, particularly by enhancing property rights and the rule of law.  

Aspects of the Washington Consensus have stirred considerable controversy over 

the past two decades.5  Williamson himself viewed the Consensus as an attempt to 

synthesize the conventional wisdom of economists and policymakers of the time, not as a 

roadmap or comprehensive strategy for development.  I have introduced this framework 

here because it is a nice summary of the prevailing views of 20 years ago, a time when 

the most dramatic growth in emerging markets still lay several years in the future.  By 

comparing current views with those described by Williamson in 1990, and accepted by 

many, we may learn something about which ideas have held up and which have been 

modified or refuted by recent events.  I will take in turn the three groups of policies that 

make up the Washington Consensus. 

The first group of recommendations, as I noted, comprised policies aimed at 

increasing macroeconomic stability.  In this case there is little controversy.  Abundant 

evidence has linked fiscal discipline, low inflation, and a stable macroeconomic policy 

                                                            
5 Examples of critiques of the Washington Consensus include Burki and Perry (1998), Rodrik (2006), and 
Birdsall and others (2010).

environment to stronger, longer-term growth in both emerging and advanced economies.6  

In particular, many emerging market economies in the 1990s emulated the success of the 

advanced economies in the 1980s in controlling inflation.  Over the years, the emerging 

market economies have also improved their fiscal management to the point that their 

fiscal positions are now often more favorable than those of some advanced economies.  

Improvements in macroeconomic management have been particularly striking in Latin 

America, where large budget deficits and high inflation rates had produced costly swings 

in economic activity in previous decades.  Brazil, for example, suffered hyperinflation 

from 1986 to 1994, with several years of inflation well in excess of 500 percent, but has 

maintained an average annual inflation rate of about 5 percent since 2006, while (not 

coincidentally) reducing the ratio of its budget deficit to its gross domestic product.  

Disciplined macroeconomic policies have also supported growth in emerging markets by 

fostering domestic savings, stimulating capital investment (including foreign direct 

investment), and reducing the risk of financial instability. 

The second group of recommendations listed by Williamson emphasized the need 

for greater reliance on markets:  the freeing up of the economy through privatization, 

deregulation, and liberalization.  The basic idea here has held up pretty well; most 

observers today would agree that carefully managed liberalization--the substitution of 

markets for bureaucratic control of the economy--is necessary for sustained growth.  For 

example, trade liberalization measures, such as the reduction of tariffs and the removal of 

                                                            
6 Fischer (1993) and Easterly (2001) document that poor growth is associated with high inflation, large 
budget deficits, and distorted foreign exchange markets.  Durlauf, Kourtellos, and Tan (2008), emphasizing 
techniques that take into account model uncertainty, also find considerable support for the importance of 
stable macroeconomic policies.  Fatas and Mihov (2009) establish that stability of policy is a relevant and 
robust determinant of cross-country differences in growth.  Easterly and Levine (1997) link much of the 
plight of Africa to macroeconomic instability.

other controls on exports and imports, have been a key element of the growth strategies 

of a number of fast-growing emerging market economies, including China.7  Openness to 

inflows of foreign direct investment has helped many emerging economies import foreign 

management techniques and technologies as well as to attract foreign capital.  More 

generally, greater use of markets improves the allocation of resources, creates incentives 

for more efficient forms of production, and encourages entrepreneurship and innovation.  

However, as I will discuss in a moment, experience has also shown that the success of 

reform programs may depend crucially on how the transition to greater market orientation 

is managed, and in particular on how market reforms are sequenced, issues on which the 

Washington Consensus is largely silent.  

The third part of the Washington Consensus focused on strengthening property 

rights and the rule of law--for example, through effective enforcement of contracts.  The 

evidence suggests that these factors too can be important for development.8  For example, 

the inability to establish clear title to land or buildings has inhibited entrepreneurship and 

investment in some poor countries.  On the other hand, some critics fault the Washington 

Consensus for paying insufficient attention to the role in economic growth of a much 

broader range of institutional factors than property rights alone--standardized accounting 

conventions, political accountability, control of corruption, bankruptcy laws, and capable 

and transparent regulatory agencies, for example.9  Moreover, the Washington Consensus 

provided little specific advice on how to create and sustain a strong institutional 

                                                            
7 See, for example, Chapter 5 of World Bank (2005).  Earlier studies documenting the importance of trade 
openness for growth include Sachs and Warner (1995, 1997) and Frankel and Romer (1999).      
8 For example, Kaufmann and others (2002) provide some evidence linking economic development to the 
presence of institutions that promote the rule of law.  
9 Burki and Perry (1998) and Rodrik (2006) are among those who argue that the Washington Consensus did 
not sufficiently emphasize the development of institutions.

framework, nor did it touch on a variety of institutional arrangements--central bank 

independence being one familiar example--that have been shown to promote economic 

stability and growth.10 

Amending the Washington Consensus 

Overall, some key elements of the Washington Consensus appear well supported 

both by basic economic logic and by their successful application by a number of 

countries.  However, the experience of the past two decades also suggests some lessons 

that augment or modify what we thought we knew about economic development in 1990.  

I will highlight three specific lessons. 

First, the implementation of the Washington Consensus recommendations is 

important and not so straightforward in practice.  In particular, as I alluded to earlier, the 

sequencing of reforms matters.  For example, some developing countries, following the 

principles of liberalization and deregulation, removed controls on the inflows of foreign 

capital, and foreign investors responded by pouring in funds.  However, the banking 

systems and the associated regulatory and supervisory agencies in these countries were 

not always well prepared to manage these capital inflows.  Consequently, some of the 

foreign capital was badly invested, which in turn contributed to emerging-market 

financial crises, like those in Mexico and emerging Asia in the 1990s.  This experience 

suggests that measures to strengthen banks and bank regulation should be put in place 

before the domestic market is opened to capital flows from abroad.   

                                                            
10 On the lack of specific advice on creating the proper institutional framework, see, for example, Rodrik 
(2011).  On the benefits of central bank independence, see, for example, Alesina and Summers (1993) and 
Cukierman and others (2002).

Similarly, dismantling controls on the domestic financial industry has proven 

counterproductive when important complementary factors--such as effective bank 

supervision, the availability of bank managers trained in market-based lending, or 

consumer familiarity with financial products such as credit cards--were absent.  For 

example, Korea experienced a mini financial crisis in early 2003, resulting from a 

massive run-up in household debt.  In the wake of policy changes to liberalize and 

increase competition in domestic financial markets, credit card debt in Korea as a share 

of its gross domestic product more than tripled between 1999 and 2002, as the average 

number of credit cards for every adult in the country rose from 1 to 3.  Korea’s 

consumers, lenders, and regulators had little experience with credit cards, and 

institutional arrangements for sharing data on consumer credit, including credit reports, 

were inadequate.  Not surprisingly, at least in retrospect, delinquency rates soared, 

putting the solvency of a number of the country’s major financial institutions at risk.  The 

broader lesson is that institutional arrangements, ranging from accounting rules to 

regulatory frameworks to tax-compliance tools, must be sufficiently developed to ensure 

that reforms are successful.  Fortunately, even in the absence of a clear consensus on how 

best to sequence and implement reforms, many countries have successfully promoted 

growth through a slow and pragmatic but continuing process of liberalization.  

A second important lesson of the past two decades involves the pivotal role of 

technology in economic development.  For emerging market economies, which tend to 

lag behind in technological sophistication, rapid gains in productivity can be achieved by 

adapting state-of-the-art technologies already developed by the advanced economies 

rather than by having to develop these technologies from scratch.  But successful

importing of technologies does not happen automatically or without preparation.  For 

example, strong educational systems producing increasingly skilled workforces have 

proven crucial for climbing the technological ladder.  In the United States, substantial 

increases in educational attainment from the beginning of the 20th century through the 

period following World War II were instrumental in driving economic growth.11  

In the emerging market world, India’s information technology (IT) services 

industry has thrived in large part because of the country’s large supply of well-educated, 

English-speaking workers.  And it is not just higher education that matters.  Encouraging 

basic levels of literacy is critical as well.  Promising programs in some emerging market 

countries, such as Brazil and Mexico, provide modest amounts of money to poor families 

(generally to women) on the condition that their children attend school regularly and 

receive basic health care.  The evidence suggests that these programs enhance the quality 

of the economy’s labor force while addressing social goals such as reducing gender and 

income inequality.    

Many emerging market economies have also harnessed international trade as an 

engine of technical progress.  Openness to trade has allowed these countries to import 

state-of-the-art capital goods, and vigorous international competition has increased the 

efficiency of domestic firms and facilitated the transfer of skills and knowledge.  

International trade has also helped shift these economies away from basic agriculture 

toward manufacturing, with substantial benefits for average productivity.  These benefits 

                                                            
11 Research by Goldin and Katz (2001) emphasizes the importance of the U.S. high school system in 
driving the country’s growth during the first decades of the 20th century.  The state-supported university 
system and the educational subsidies of the G.I. Bill boosted educational attainment and growth after World 
War II.  (See, for example, Altschuler and Blumin (2009).)  It should be noted that increasing the share of 
the public budget devoted to education was advocated by the Washington Consensus.

of trade openness do not require large trade surpluses, by the way, only a willingness to 

engage with and integrate with the global economy.  Notably, Korea ran current account 

deficits through much of its “growth miracle” phase.        

A third important lesson that has come into sharper focus, and which was not 

fully appreciated by the Washington Consensus, involves the capacity to draw on 

economies of scale to accelerate the pace of technical progress and economic growth.  

Economies of scale refer to the efficiency gains that can be achieved in some industries 

when production is run at a very large scale.  These gains may arise because of the nature 

of the technologies involved--as, for example, in steel manufacturing.12  But in some 

cases they can also arise because of the need to develop a critical mass of skilled workers 

and specialized suppliers.  It is no coincidence that so many high-tech firms locate near 

each other in California’s Silicon Valley or North Carolina’s Research Triangle; these 

firms benefit from the ability to draw on sufficiently large pools of skilled labor and other 

resources, while sharing ideas and information in mutually beneficial ways.13  A single, 

isolated firm would not likely be as productive.  Thus, scale economies can arise in the 

development of knowledge centers, like research universities, or in the building of large-

scale infrastructure, like a national highway system.14  For example, India’s IT industry is 

clustered in certain regions, such as Bangalore, around some of the more successful and 

high-quality institutes of technology in the country.  Moreover, recent research suggests 

that the growth of information technology activity in India has increased returns to 

                                                            
12 In such cases we call them “natural monopolies.”  
13 This idea whereby economies of scale can be continuously exploited by the sharing of ideas and 
“learning-by-doing” is one source of what is called “endogenous growth” in the economics literature.  See, 
for example, Romer (1986) and Lucas (1988).  While the idea of “natural monopolies” was well understood 
at the time the Washington Consensus came out, the “endogenous growth” literature was in its infancy.   
14 See, for example, Barro (1990).

schooling and has significantly increased primary school enrollment in areas where call 

centers are located.15   

Encouraging international trade can also help countries capture the benefits of 

scale.  For many emerging market economies, domestic markets are not large enough to 

support the amount of production needed to achieve efficiency gains.  Access to global 

markets has enabled production to expand to levels where economies of scale could be 

more fully exploited.  Additional efficiencies can sometimes be gained when countries 

specialize in particular stages of a good’s production.  They import parts and components 

from other countries and use them to produce new products, which themselves may be 

further processed or assembled in still other countries.  At each stage, the production is 

for the world market rather than for domestic producers or consumers alone.  Many Asian 

economies are interlinked through a network of vertical supply chains; China is often 

referred to as the endpoint in the global supply chain because the assembly of so many 

goods is completed there before being shipped to consumers around the world. 

The existence of economies of scale may, in some circumstances, also create a 

rationale for targeted government interventions in the economy--in other words, 

industrial policy.  The premise of industrial policy is that large-scale industries may not 

be able to get off the ground without government support or protection, given the 

substantial start-up costs and the existence of more-efficient competitors in other 

countries.  Indeed, government support for certain industries does seem to have played a 

role in several of the best-performing emerging market economies, including China and 

                                                            
15 See Oster and Millet (2011).

Korea.16  But such interventions can be double-edged swords.  The experience of many 

decades tells us that industrial policies are far from a sure-fire development strategy, as 

they require that the government be adept at picking winners.  One example, the role of 

government intervention in promoting ethanol production in Brazil, illustrates the 

vagaries of industrial policies.  After being introduced over the mid- to late 1970s, for 

several years the program was generally viewed as a failure.  More recently, however, the 

sustained upward trend in world oil prices has turned ethanol production in Brazil into a 

profitable venture.17  But in many cases, similar interventions have failed or crowded out 

the development of other, potentially more profitable industries.  

Lessons and Implications for the Future  

What implications can we draw for longer-term prospects for growth in the 

emerging market economies?  Notwithstanding the recent impressive growth, output per 

person in the emerging market economies generally remains much lower than in the 

advanced economies.  This fact suggests that the emerging market economies should be 

able to maintain relatively high growth rates for some years to come, as they continue to 

catch up to the advanced economies.  But over time, as the emerging market countries 

become wealthier and technologically more sophisticated, they will gradually lose the 

advantages of starting from behind.  Even with continued strong policies, their growth 

will slow as returns to capital investments diminish and the most profitable opportunities 

are exploited. 18  For example, over time, rising wages in manufacturing should make 

                                                            
16 Rodrik (2010), for example, discusses China’s case.    
17 After 1989, ethanol subsidies in Brazil were removed, but other forms of indirect government support 
were maintained.  
18 Recent research by Eichengreen and others (2011) draws on cross-country evidence to show that the pace 
of a country’s economic growth tends to slow once its level of real per capita income crosses a certain 
threshold.

production and investment in China and other East Asian nations less attractive.  Also, 

technological progress will slow as the process of importing foreign technologies reaches 

its limits, forcing greater reliance on innovation in emerging countries themselves.  

Resource and environmental constraints, as well as aging populations, should also slow 

economic growth.  But in many ways, such a slowdown in growth will be the inevitable 

result of progress--the culmination of a successful catching up process--and in that 

respect should be viewed as a consequence of success, not of failure.  

Many emerging markets also will be challenged by their reliance on trade to drive 

growth.  As I have discussed, international trade has many benefits.  However, generating 

trade surpluses by suppressing domestic demand defeats the ultimate purpose of 

economic growth--improving the lot of the country’s own citizens.  Large and persistent 

imbalances in trade are also inconsistent, in the long run, with global economic and 

financial stability.  Of course, the advanced economies, like the United States, need to do 

their part as well in reducing global imbalances, as I have noted on numerous occasions 

before.  

In fact, with the emerging market economies accounting for a large and growing 

share of global activity, many of them can no longer view themselves as small, open 

economies whose actions have little effect on their neighbors.  With increasing size and 

influence comes greater responsibility.  In response to this new reality, many of our 

international institutions have been restructured in recent years to give an increased voice 

to the emerging market economies.  For example, the Group of Twenty (which has 

significant emerging market representation) has largely supplanted the Group of Seven as 

the premier global forum for economic and financial policy matters, and emerging market 


- 14 - 
 

 
 

economies have been given increased power in setting the policies of the International 

Monetary Fund.  These forums should be used by advanced economies and emerging 

economies alike to meet their respective responsibilities to the global economy in a spirit 

of cooperation.   

So, what lessons can we draw about the Washington Consensus and, more 

generally, about the experience of the dynamic emerging market economies over the past 

decades?  Ultimately, the principles that John Williamson enumerated two decades ago 

have much to recommend them.  Macroeconomic stability, increased reliance on market 

forces, and strong political and economic institutions are important for sustainable 

growth.  However, with the experience and perspective of the past 20 years, we can see 

that Williamson’s recommendations were not complete.  Reforms must be sequenced and 

implemented appropriately to have their desired effects.  And a successful development 

framework must take into account that activities such as the adaptation of advanced 

technologies and the harnessing economies of scale are often critical to economic growth 

and depend on a host of institutional conditions, such as an educated workforce, to be 

fully effective.    

Indeed, advanced economies like the United States would do well to re-learn 

some of the lessons from the experiences of the emerging market economies, such as the 

importance of disciplined fiscal policies, the benefits of open trade, the need to encourage 

private capital formation while undertaking necessary public investments, the high 

returns to education and to promoting technological advances, and the importance of a 

regulatory framework that encourages entrepreneurship and innovation while maintaining 

financial stability.  As the advanced economies look for ways of enhancing longer-term

growth, a re-reading of Williamson’s original Washington Consensus, combined with 

close attention to the experiences of successful emerging market economies, could pay 

significant dividends.
