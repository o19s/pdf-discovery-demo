Tailoring Community Bank Regulation and Supervision 

Remarks by 

Daniel K. Tarullo  

Member  

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

at the 

Independent Community Bankers of America 
2015 Washington Policy Summit  

 April 30, 2015


 On numerous occasions over the last year, I have discussed the importance of 

differentiating prudential regulation and supervision based on the varying nature of the risks 

posed by different groups of banks.1  This differentiation needs to be explicit both in the analytic 

foundations of our prudential system and in the application of that system to banking 

organizations.   

At an analytic level, we need to be clear that prudential aims vary with the risks posed by 

diverse groups of banks.  To take an obvious example, the risks to the entire financial system that 

would arise from the failure of a very large, universal bank call for different prudential objectives 

from those suitable for a $200 million community bank.  At the level of application, we need to 

tailor prudential regulations and supervisory practices with an eye both to those varying 

objectives and to the characteristics of differing groups of banks. 

This morning I would like to revisit, and develop a bit more, the concept of regulatory 

and supervisory “tiering” as it pertains to community banks.  First, I will lay some analytic 

foundations by identifying what I believe to be the most salient characteristics of community 

banks for determining suitable regulatory objectives and prudential policies.  Second, I will turn 

to the implementation of those objectives by explaining how we have tried in practice to shape 

supervisory policies appropriately.  Third, I will touch on the implications of those objectives for 

some regulatory issues, including capital requirements.

Prudential Objectives for Community Bank Oversight 

 At the outset, let me note that in speaking of “community banks,” I am generally using 

the term as defined in the Federal Reserve’s supervisory portfolio.  That is, it refers to banks with 

$10 billion or less in total assets.  But it is worth making two observations about this definition.  

First is the fact that the vast majority of community banks have less than $1 billion in assets.  

Second is the fact that, for purposes of establishing regulatory objectives, a bank with $12 billion 

in assets might not be readily distinguishable from one with $8 billion in assets.  Of course, lines 

will always have to be drawn in applying regulations and establishing supervisory practices.  But 

it is useful to keep these facts in mind in thinking about prudential tiering. 

The two most important characteristics of community banks for purposes of establishing 

regulatory objectives and supervisory practices are their size and their business model.  My 

reference to size is obviously a bit tautological, but size is worth emphasizing precisely because 

of what it says about the risks community banks do not pose.  The possible failure of a 

community bank self-evidently poses no risks to the financial system.  And while individual 

community banks in smaller communities provide sources of credit that would be hard to 

replace, their limited size means their failures would not result in credit contraction in significant 

swaths of the country.  

The business model of nearly all community banks is grounded in the most traditional 

form of commercial banking--lending to businesses and households with funds predominantly 

obtained from deposit accounts.  And, as this audience well knows, lending by community banks 

is built substantially on relationship banking.  While community banks over the years have found 

it increasingly difficult to compete with larger banks in the types of lending that can be 

efficiently scaled through larger volumes and standardized credit models, they maintain a 




- 3 - 
 

 
competitive advantage relative to larger banks through knowledge of their local communities and 

their individual borrowers.  As a result, community banks play a unique role in their local 

economies, particularly with regard to lending to small- and medium-sized businesses.  The 

relationships these institutions have with their customers oftentimes mean they can look beyond 

traditional credit factors to consider unique borrower characteristics when making credit 

decisions and to reduce information failures about borrowers’ willingness and capacity to repay 

loans.  Numerous studies have documented these advantages and their value to economic 

development.  One recent study found that loans extended by rural community banks to small 

businesses default less frequently than similar loans granted by their urban counterparts, and that 

the performance advantage is greater when the bank and the borrower are located in the same 

county.2 

The traditional intermediation provided by community banks, along with the relatively 

small scale on which each community bank provides these services, suggests that the principal 

relevant prudential aim should be the equally traditional one of protecting the deposit insurance 

fund.  A second aim should be to help protect the availability of credit in geographic areas or to 

particular classes of borrowers unlikely to be served by larger banks.  It is important to note that 

this second aim implies not only that we want community banks to be operated in a safe and 

sound manner, but that we want them to be able to operate successfully.  Just as rural customers 

would be denied credit if their bank fails, they would also be denied credit if their bank’s costs 

make it an unviable business proposition.

Supervision of Community Banks 

 Let me turn now to describing how our supervisory policies reflect these regulatory 

objectives.  First, of course, the Federal Reserve has long organized supervision into four 

portfolios of banking organizations, based principally--though not exclusively--on asset size.  

Since the financial crisis and the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer 

Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), supervisory policies for the largest firms have become 

increasingly more data-driven, horizontal, and centrally coordinated.  The enhanced prudential 

standards applicable to the largest firms, such as supervisory stress tests and quantitative 

liquidity regulation, have increased the differences in supervisory practice among our four 

portfolios.  We do not regard the supervision of community banks (or, for that matter, smaller 

regional banks) as a diluted version of large bank supervision, but as an entirely separate 

undertaking.  We believe there is a distinct “state-of-the-art” approach to each of the four 

portfolios, including community banks. 

 Second, supervision within the community bank portfolio has not been centralized in the 

way that large firm supervision has been.  On the contrary, with 837 state member community 

banks and several thousand community bank holding companies, it would make little sense to do 

so.  While we strive for a well-considered overall supervisory program for our community bank 

portfolio, we will continue to rely on the examiners in the 12 Federal Reserve Banks to carry out 

that program in accordance with local conditions and based on the varying situations of 

community banks.   

I believe this intention reflects the preference of most community bankers, who worry 

that more centralization of supervisory practice would lead to delays in getting answers to 

questions and decisions on applications.  At the same time, members of the Board do, from time 




- 5 - 
 

 
to time, hear complaints from community bankers that supervisory practice may not always be 

consistent across Reserve Banks.  To some degree, of course, this is an inevitable byproduct of 

an approach that leans toward bottom-up supervision.  Nonetheless, our staff at the Board will 

continue to assess practices across all the Reserve Bank districts to promote overall consistency 

without micromanaging the supervision of individual banks.  And I want to emphasize that, if 

community bankers believe that significant variation in certain practices or policies is having an 

unfair or deleterious effect on one or more of their banks, they should feel more than comfortable 

raising these concerns with Board staff.  We do not regard such observations as criticism of our 

examiners, but instead as opportunities to test, and possibly adjust, our policies to promote 

overall consistency.  

A third way in which our community bank supervision differs from that of other banks is 

the particular effort made to limit the length of examinations and the amount of time bank 

personnel must spend on them.  Community banks have much smaller balance sheets over which 

to amortize the resources they spend on regulatory and supervisory requirements.  Of late, we 

have increased off-site supervisory activities, which can reduce the burden on community bank 

personnel.  For example, we can conduct some aspects of the loan review process off site for 

banks that maintain electronic loan records.  While off-site loan review has burden-reducing 

benefits for both bankers and examiners, some bankers have expressed concern that increasing 

off-site supervisory activities could potentially reduce the ability of banks to have face-to-face 

discussions with examiners regarding asset quality or risk-management issues.  Accordingly, we 

remain flexible and will continue to work with community banks that may prefer their loan 

reviews to be conducted on site.

More generally, the Federal Reserve has invested substantial resources in developing 

technological tools for examiners to improve the efficiency of both off-site and on-site 

supervisory activities.  These measures should lead to greater consistency and more efficient, 

effective, and risk-focused examinations by better enabling staff to tailor the scope of 

examinations to the activities and risks of individual banks.  The automation of various parts of 

the community bank examination process can also save examiners and bankers time, as a bank 

can submit requested pre-examination information electronically rather than mailing paper 

copies to a Reserve Bank.  Through these efforts, the Federal Reserve aims to strike an 

appropriate balance between off-site and on-site supervisory activities to ensure that community 

banks are subject to supervision that is both high-quality and resource-efficient. 

Fourth, our supervisory oversight of community banks is itself grounded in the traditional 

relationship banking model of funding local lending with customer deposits.  There are risks in 

this model, of course, since geographic and portfolio concentration can make community banks 

vulnerable to local economic downturns, as we have witnessed during and after the Great 

Recession.  Even though the number of banks on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s 

“Problem List” has fallen from a peak of 888 at the end of the first quarter of 2011 to 291 at the 

end of 2014, this number is still nearly three times the historical average.  But these risks are 

understood by supervisors and bankers.  Traditional regulatory and supervisory methods are well 

suited to deal with them.  Indeed, it is noteworthy that most community banks adhering to this 

model continued to thrive even during the worst years of the financial crisis.3

In contrast, community banks that moved beyond their traditional business model and 

entered unfamiliar or more complex lines or markets experienced difficulties.  For example, 

small banks that turned to a more transactional model and funded construction loans, often 

outside of their local markets, with borrowings rather than core deposits were more likely to fail.  

This experience helps explain why our supervisory intensity will often increase for banks, 

including community banks, that embark upon unfamiliar activities. 

A similar pattern obtains in the Federal Reserve’s supervision of consumer compliance in 

community banks.  It is axiomatic that all financial consumers deserve the same protection, 

whether they are doing business with a very large bank, a regional bank, or a community bank.  

But community banks do not have large systems with hundreds or thousands of employees in 

contact with consumers on a daily basis.  So, while the substantive goals of consumer protection 

remain the same across banks, the way in which we check compliance at community banks takes 

account, again, of their size, less complex structure, and business model.  These characteristics of 

community banks informed the revisions to our risk-focused consumer compliance supervision 

framework, which was implemented in January 2014.4   

Under the revised program, examination intensity is explicitly based on an individual 

community bank’s risk profile, including its consumer compliance culture and how effectively it 

identifies and manages consumer compliance risk.  Examiners do more comprehensive risk 

assessments before they arrive on site, permitting them to focus on areas of higher risk at 

individual banks.  The program also calls for examiners to spend less time on low-risk 

compliance issues at community banks.  Of course, in cases where a firm’s risk profile is high or 

an international context, see Franco Fiordelisi, Stefano Monferra, and Gabriele Sampagnaro (2014), “Relationship 
Lending and Credit Quality,” Journal of Financial Services Research, vol. 46, pp. 295–315.

where it changes materially as a result of the addition of more complex or higher-risk strategies, 

more frequent contact may be appropriate.   

Early feedback from bankers and examiners regarding the program has been largely 

positive.  For example, bankers have noted that examiners seem to better understand their 

institutions, that the exam work undertaken better reflects the individual institutions being 

examined, and that the time spent by examiners at the banks has decreased.  We will be 

conducting a review of the program this summer to determine if adjustments are needed. 

Our examiners have observed increased consumer compliance risk where community 

banks move into products that are less congruent with bank-customer relationships in the 

traditional community bank business model, such as prepaid cards or credit card add-on 

products.  Similarly, risks can arise where a bank relies upon third-party providers for core 

banking services or products that the bank does not have the resources or expertise to undertake 

in-house.  Of course, when properly chosen and managed, the use of third-party providers is not 

only acceptable, but desirable for important services such as cybersecurity.  But reliance upon 

third parties to broaden a bank’s scope of operations can pose supervisory concerns when the 

bank itself does not have adequate capacity to vet and monitor these vendors.5  For example, a 

bank that relies upon a third party to provide a loan processing system or to conduct compliance 

audits may face increased risks because the bank no longer has direct control over these 

activities.   

Simplifying the Regulatory Regime for Community Banks 

  In the wake of the financial crisis, the overall aim of the Dodd-Frank Act was to 

strengthen the regulation of banks and certain other parts of the financial system.  A key 

5 See www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1319.htm.

regulatory innovation in Dodd-Frank was regulatory tiering--the creation of different classes of 

banking organizations, based dominantly though not exclusively on asset size, to which different 

regulations were to apply.  Underlying this tiering was the principle that progressively more 

stringent regulation should apply to the different classes of banks based on their relative 

importance to the financial system, and thus the harm that could be expected to the system if they 

failed.  As with supervision, an important consideration in regulatory tiering is to weigh the 

compliance cost of a particular rule against the safety and soundness benefits to be gained by that 

rule with respect to specific groups of banks.  Of particular significance in performing this 

assessment for community banks is, as I mentioned earlier, the fact that their smaller scale means 

that they have a more limited base of activities across which to amortize certain fixed 

compliance costs.  

There are two complementary ways to implement a tiered approach to prudential 

regulation.  One is to apply specific regulations only to those classes of banking organizations 

whose activities and scale require those measures.  The other is to tailor the application of 

generally applicable measures based on the size or other salient characteristics of banking 

organizations.  When regulatory agencies adopt regulations under their general prudential 

authority, they usually have a choice as between these approaches.  When the agencies are 

implementing statutory mandates, their discretion to exclude or tailor may be constrained in 

some respects.   

In implementing the Dodd-Frank Act and in modifying our regulations under general 

prudential authorities, we have tried to include appropriate tiering in accordance with the 

considerations I mentioned a few moments ago.  But over the last few years there emerged a 




- 10 - 
 

 
fairly widespread view that some fine tuning of regulatory tiering was warranted.  Let me now 

offer a few of my own thoughts on this point.   

First, I want to mention how pleased we were that last December Congress amended the 

statutory provision that had prevented us from raising the threshold for application of our Small 

Bank Holding Company Policy Statement.  I will not repeat here the purpose and history of this 

statement, which I described in advocating this change last fall.6  I will note that earlier this 

month, the Board issued a final rule implementing the statutory change.7  The rule expands the 

scope of application of the statement from bank holding companies with less than $500 million 

in total consolidated assets to those with less than $1 billion, and adds savings and loan holding 

companies.  As a result, our statement now covers nearly 90 percent of bank holding companies.  

We had already taken steps to relieve the regulatory reporting burden for the impacted firms--

specifically, by eliminating quarterly and more complex consolidated financial reporting 

requirements for all of these institutions and eliminating certain regulatory reporting 

requirements entirely for savings and loan holding companies with less than $500 million in 

assets.8 

Second, I want to reiterate my view that a few Dodd-Frank Act provisions might usefully 

be amended to exclude community banks entirely from their coverage.  As I have said before, the 

concerns addressed by provisions such as the Volcker rule and the incentive compensation 

requirements of section 956 are substantially greater at larger institutions.  In the unusual case in

which a small bank is engaged in proprietary trading that could pose a risk to the deposit 

insurance fund or has in place a compensation system that incentivizes excessive risk, the 

supervisory process would remain available to address these risks.  I recognize that statutory 

revisions of this sort would not be a major reduction in compliance burden.  But they would 

reflect the fact that, absent a change in this regard, community banks must expend scarce 

compliance resources to conform to the requirements of such regulations.  There is, in my view, 

no need to make particularized prudential requirements of this sort applicable on a mandatory 

basis to thousands of community banks.  Indeed, the Volcker rule and the Dodd-Frank Act 

incentive compensation provisions present almost prototypical cases in which minimal potential 

safety and soundness benefits are outweighed by the compliance costs faced by those thousands 

of banks.  It would be preferable to relieve both supervisors and community banks from 

examining compliance with these kinds of requirements in order to concentrate resources on the 

real issues presently faced by these institutions, such as cybersecurity and interest rate risks. 

Third, I want to address concerns that community bankers have expressed regarding the 

revised standardized capital requirements issued in 2013.  In particular, we have heard that the 

framework’s separate risk weight for high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) loans is 

burdensome in part because it requires firms to classify which loans within their corporate loan 

portfolios are HVCRE using a complex definition that includes calculation of each such 

exposure’s loan-to-value ratio.  I should first say that, unlike proprietary trading or distorted 

compensation packages, HVCRE lending has posed real and substantial risks for community 

banks in recent years.  These kinds of loans performed much worse in the recession than other 

commercial real estate loans and, in fact, were a significant factor behind many of the roughly 

500 bank failures during this period. 




- 12 - 
 

 
So, we do need to take account of HVCRE risks, given that commercial real estate 

lending accounts for a significant percentage of the assets of many community banks.  But we 

can look for ways to simplify the specific capital requirements while ensuring that appropriate 

capital buffers exist.  For example, it might be possible to determine applicable capital 

requirements by reference to the proportion of a bank’s real estate loans that are HVCRE, as 

defined more simply, rather than requiring more elaborate loan-by-loan calculations. 

More generally, it is worthwhile for the bank regulatory agencies to consider possibilities 

for a broader simplification of capital requirements for smaller community banks.  As important 

as it was to make the Basel I risk-based requirements more risk sensitive, it is also important to 

recognize that the greater detail of the new rules requires a degree of categorization, 

recordkeeping, and reporting that may be particularly costly, in relative terms, for smaller 

community banks.  So we should explore whether we can achieve the safety and soundness 

purposes of capital regulation in a simplified way.  

In doing so, of course, we must be mindful of the Collins Amendment, which requires 

that minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements be established for all insured 

depository institutions and bank holding companies, and that the minimum applicable 

requirements not be less than “generally applicable” requirements.9  Still, there are some 

possibilities that may be consistent with the Collins Amendment.  For example, one idea I have 

heard is to allow smaller community banks to opt into a simpler set of risk-weighted capital 

requirements in exchange for a higher minimum required ratio than under the more risk-

sensitive, but more complicated, standardized risk-weighted requirements finalized in 2013.  I 

 
9 Section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Act, popularly known as the Collins Amendment, requires that the federal banking 
agencies establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all banking organizations that are not less than 
“generally applicable” risk-based capital requirements.  





- 13 - 
 

 
believe the concept of a “simpler” set of requirements is meant to describe something much 

closer to Basel I in terms of the detail and number of risk categories.  Because so many smaller 

community banks maintain capital levels well above minimum regulatory levels anyway, the 

tradeoff of higher requirements for a simpler approach may be promising 

This is only one idea, and there may be other approaches that could simplify smaller 

community bank capital requirements in a manner consistent with the Collins Amendment.  I 

look forward to discussions within the banking agencies, with the industry, and with other 

interested parties on possibilities for developing a sensible and feasible approach. 

Conclusion 

 Having just become chair of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, I 

hope to make the required decennial review under the Economic Growth and Regulatory 

Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) a productive one.  A productive exercise in this context 

will, among other things, be one that results in changes in the regulations and supervisory 

practices of the banking agencies so as to yield significant reduction in compliance costs for 

community banks.  It should not be a merely bureaucratic exercise in formal fulfillment of a 

statutory requirement.  There are numerous issues beyond those I’ve mentioned already that 

almost surely can be profitably addressed, including reporting requirements and examination 

practices. 

The chances of this outcome occurring will be maximized if regulators work to put 

ourselves in the place of community banks in order to understand in concrete ways the impact of 

particular regulatory and supervisory practices upon them and if, reciprocally, bankers 

understand the responsibility of regulators to protect the safety and soundness of banks and, thus, 

the deposit insurance fund.  So, for example, although it is always useful to hear why regulated 




- 14 - 
 

 
entities think a particular practice is unduly burdensome, it is even more useful to hear concrete 

suggestions for how that practice might be modified so as to reduce compliance burden while 

still achieving the ultimate regulatory objective.    

Thank you very much.
