Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

before the   

Financial Services Committee

Committee on Small Business 

of the  

United States House of Representatives 



February 26, 2010 



 

 Chairman Frank, Chairwoman Velázquez, Ranking Member Bachus, Ranking Member 

Graves, committee members, thank you for the invitation to today’s joint committee hearing to 

discuss the availability of credit to small businesses as well as the steps being taken to help 

ensure that the credit needs of creditworthy borrowers are met.  As you are well aware, the 

Federal Reserve has taken significant steps to improve financial market conditions, and has 

worked with the Treasury and bank and thrift supervisors to strengthen U.S. banking 

organizations.  We remain attentive to the need for banks to remain in sound financial condition 

and to continue to lend prudently to creditworthy borrowers.  Loans to small businesses are 

especially vital to our economy, as they employ nearly 40 percent of the private sector 

workforce.  

 First, I will discuss the overall state of small business lending and address the causes of 

reduced lending to small businesses.  I will then discuss the improving prospects for small 

business lending in 2010, key preconditions of which include a sustainable economic recovery, 

financial stability, and the overall safety and soundness of the banking system.  Finally, I will 

discuss measures taken by the Federal Reserve, including recent guidance issued in cooperation 

with other bank regulators, to ensure that supervisory policies do not impede credit availability 

for creditworthy borrowers. 

The State of Small Business Lending 

While conditions in financial markets continue to improve, access to credit remains 

difficult for many small businesses that largely depend on banks for credit.  Lending by 

commercial banks dropped precipitously in 2009.  With the exception of consumer lending in the 

early part of the year, lending of all types declined.  Between June 30, 2008, and June 30, 2009, 

outstanding small loans to businesses and farms declined by more than $14 billion, a reduction of

nearly 2 percent.  Commercial and industrial (C&I) loans, including loans to small businesses, 

fell particularly rapidly, declining by double-digit percentages during 2009.1  Commercial real 

estate (CRE) and credit card lending, categories that include loans to small businesses, also fell 

throughout the year. 

 Notably, the contraction in lending has been less severe at smaller banks, which tend to 

cater to small businesses.  For example, banks with less than $10 billion in total assets reduced 

their business loans (including C&I and CRE loans) at about a 12.8 percent annual rate in the 

fourth quarter of 2009, while at larger banks business loans dropped at a pace of more than 20 

percent.  Although the pattern of reduced lending differed across banks, in aggregate, banks of 

all sizes have reduced their business loan portfolios.  This development is especially problematic 

for small businesses, given that they typically lack access to public capital markets.   

 The terms of the small business loans that are being made also have tightened 

considerably since the beginning of the recession.  Responses to the Federal Reserve’s Senior 

Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicate that banks, on net, 

have significantly tightened credit standards on C&I loans to small firms over the past few years.  

In addition, the pricing of C&I loans to small businesses became more stringent last year.  Data 

from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Terms of Business Lending show that interest rate spreads 

on loans between $100,000 and $1,000,000 increased by about 100 basis points during 2009, 

reaching their highest levels in more than a decade.  However, pricing for large loans has 

tightened as well, with spreads on loans from $10 million to $25 million also increasing about 

100 basis points in 2009. 


                                                            
1   The most recent data from the Federal Reserve’s Flow of Funds report indicate that, for example, C&I lending by 
commercial banks declined by about 24 percent.  Declines for other categories of lending in the same period were 
about 9 percent for commercial real estate and residential real estate, and 5 percent for consumer lending.

The Causes of Reduced Lending to Small Businesses 

 Numerous factors have contributed to the reduced lending to small businesses.  For 

instance, for most commercial banks, the quality of existing loan portfolios continues to 

deteriorate even as levels of delinquent and nonperforming loans remain on the rise.  Throughout 

2009, loan quality deteriorated significantly for both large and small banks, and the latest data 

from the fourth quarter indicate continuing elevated loss rates across all loan categories.  

Anecdotal information suggests that, while consumer delinquencies may be close to peaking, 

other types of lending such as CRE and small business lending are likely to see delinquencies 

and charge-offs continue to rise for some time to come.  In response to a special question in the 

January SLOOS, a large net fraction of banks reported that the credit quality of their existing 

C&I loans to small firms was worse than that for their loans to larger firms in the fourth quarter.  

In addition, respondents did not, on net, anticipate an improvement in the performance of their 

small loan portfolio over the next year.  Accordingly, banks have reduced existing lines of credit 

sharply and tightened their standards and terms for new credit.  While some businesses are being 

denied credit due to a recent history of payment problems, even businesses with excellent 

payment records may find credit restricted or unavailable due to weakened balance sheets, 

reduced revenues or falling real estate collateral values.  Further, businesses that qualified for 

credit under more accommodative conditions may not meet new tighter standards.  Credit 

conditions may be particularly tight for small businesses because their finances are, in many 

instances, very closely intertwined with the personal finances of their owners.  Data from the 

Federal Reserve’s 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances showed that approximately 

11 percent of households own and actively manage a small business.2  Of these households,

Reserve Bulletin, February 2009, page A35.

about 18 percent used personal assets to guarantee or collateralize loans for their businesses and 

a similar fraction made at least one loan to the business.  Thus, the condition of household net 

worth is often relevant to the ability of some small businesses to obtain credit.  With declines in 

house prices since 2006 and consequent weakened household balance sheets, the ability of many 

small business owners to borrow has likely been impaired.   

 Despite general improvements in financial market conditions and in bank stock prices 

and earnings during the second half of 2009, lending is likely inhibited by various problems 

afflicting many banks, both large and small.  Banks with capital positions that have been eroded 

by losses or those with limited access to capital markets may be reducing risky assets to improve 

their capital positions, especially amid continued uncertainty about the economic outlook and 

possible future loan losses.  Indeed, with the number of problem banks having risen to 702 

institutions with $402.8 billion in assets, many firms are capital constrained and may be unable 

to increase lending.  And, even though deposits are now plentiful, some banks have funding 

concerns.  Bank funding markets were badly impaired for a time, and some banks have 

accordingly decided to hold larger buffers of liquid assets than before.  A number of other factors 

are also likely in play.  Higher deposit insurance assessments increase funding costs.  Some 

securitization markets remain impaired, reducing an important source of funding for bank loans.  

Finally, changes to accounting rules, beginning in 2010, will require many banks to move a large 

volume of securitized assets back onto their balance sheets, perhaps putting further pressure on 

bank capital.    

 During the financial crisis, a number of lending relationships have been severed as 

individual banks sought to reduce loan portfolios, or concentrations within those portfolios, or as 

banks failed or merged.  Established banking relationships are particularly important to small 



 

- 5 -

businesses, who generally do not have access to the broader capital markets and for whom credit 

extension is often based on private information acquired through repeated interactions over time.  

When existing lending relationships are broken, time may be required for other banks to 

establish and build such relationships, allowing lending to resume. 

Some banks may be overly conservative in their small business lending because of 

concerns that they will be subject to criticism from their examiners.  While prudence is 

warranted in all bank lending, especially in an uncertain economic environment, some potentially 

profitable loans to creditworthy small businesses may have been lost because of these concerns, 

particularly on the part of small banks.  Indeed, there may be instances in which individual 

examiners have criticized small business loans in an overly reflexive fashion.  As I will discuss 

later in my testimony, the Federal Reserve has worked with other bank and thrift supervisors to 

ensure that supervisory policy does not unnecessarily constrain credit to creditworthy borrowers. 

 The reduction in the availability of credit, however, is not the whole story.  There is also 

less demand for credit.  The most severe economic downturn since the Depression, resulting in 

high levels of unemployment and following significant increases in personal debt levels during 

the past decade, has suppressed demand for goods and services produced by all businesses, 

including smaller firms.  Many businesses are, in turn, reluctant to make new investments until 

they are confident that consumer demand will continue to strengthen.  Business inventories, a 

key component of gross domestic product over the business cycle, unexpectedly declined 0.2 

percent in December after rising by a revised 0.5 percent in November.  It is notable that banks 

report utilization rates of existing lines of credit to be at historic lows, despite the fact that, in 

many cases, this credit is already approved and generally priced attractively.

 According to recent surveys conducted by the National Federation of Independent 

Businesses (NFIB), financing conditions continued to be ranked as the top business concern by 

only a modest fraction (less than 5 percent) of small businesses; in contrast, about one-third of 

respondents cited poor sales as their most important problem.  Commercial bank responses to the 

SLOOS continue to indicate reduced demand for loans from small businesses.  Similarly, a poll 

conducted by the Independent Community Bankers of America on January 8 revealed that a lack 

of loan demand was the factor most frequently cited by member institutions as constraining small 

business lending. 

Improving Prospects for Small Business Lending in 2010 

 Improvement in a number of the conditions that depressed lending in 2009, however, lead 

me to be somewhat optimistic that we may begin to see an increase in bank loans later this year.   

First, economic conditions, the most important determinant in the demand for, and availability 

of, small business lending, have improved considerably since the early and middle part of last 

year.  In particular, spending by businesses and households appears to have gained some 

momentum.  However, unemployment remains high, and concerns about the pace of job creation 

this year may restrain the consumer spending that is essential to overall business confidence.  

Encouragingly, financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth, 

with notable declines in many risk spreads, some resumption of securitization activity, and a 

rebound of equity prices since their market low in early 2009.   

 While financing conditions certainly remain tight for many small businesses, conditions 

would be considerably worse were it not for the action taken by the Federal Reserve and other 

government agencies in response to the financial crisis.  Beginning in September 2007, the 

Federal Reserve sharply reduced its target for the federal funds rate, which influences interest 



 

- 7 -

rates throughout the economy, and since December 2008, the target has been near zero.  To 

improve mortgage market functioning and support housing markets and economic activity more 

broadly, the Federal Reserve has purchased large amounts of debt and mortgage-backed 

securities issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae in addition to purchasing long-

term Treasury securities to help improve conditions in private credit markets. 

 In the context of the enormous stress in many markets that characterized the financial 

crisis, the Federal Reserve also established new lending facilities and expanded existing facilities 

to respond to the unusual absence of liquidity in important markets and thereby enhanced the 

flow of credit to businesses and households.  In particular, the Federal Reserve has provided 

support to securitization markets, which had been an important source of funding for loans to 

households and businesses.  Securitization markets (other than those for mortgages guaranteed 

by the government or government-sponsored enterprises) essentially shut down in mid-2008.  In 

response, the Federal Reserve, with the support of the Treasury Department, developed the Term 

Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF).  The TALF promotes the issuance of securities 

backed by loans to households and small businesses, including auto loans, credit card loans, 

student loans, and loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration (SBA).  In 2009, the 

program was broadened to allow investors to use the TALF to finance both existing and newly 

issued commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). 

  The TALF helped restart securitization markets and increase the availability of credit to 

small businesses and consumers.  To date, the TALF program has helped finance 480,000 loans 

to small businesses, 2.6 million auto loans, 876,000 student loans, more than 100 million credit 

card accounts, and 100,000 loans to larger businesses.  Included among those business loans are 

4,900 loans to auto dealers to help finance their inventories.  About half of the SBA securities 



 

- 8 -

issued in recent months--corresponding to roughly $250 million in loans a month--were sold to 

investors that financed the acquisitions in part with TALF loans.  In an encouraging sign, rate 

spreads for asset-backed securities (ABS) have declined significantly, and a substantial amount 

of ABS are now being brought to market and purchased by investors without TALF financing.  

Thus, the TALF and other Federal Reserve programs provided critical liquidity support to the 

economy until the financial system stabilized.  With the extraordinary stress on liquidity in many 

markets having abated, many of these programs either have been or are scheduled to be wound 

down. 

A second reason to expect some improvement in credit conditions for small businesses is 

that bank attitudes toward lending, including small business lending, may be shifting.  The 

January SLOOS showed that bank tightening of credit standards for small business C&I lending 

appeared to be nearing an end with similar numbers of banks reporting tightening and easing of 

their lending standards. 

 There is also some tentative, anecdotal evidence that many bankers may be devoting 

considerably more energy toward extending new loans in 2010, as contrasted with their 

overwhelming preoccupation in 2009 with collecting on or writing down loans already on their 

books.  With respect to small business lending in particular, some banks have instituted so-called 

“second look” programs that--as the name implies--involve a reconsideration of loan applications 

that would not be pursued based on a credit scoring model alone.  Some banks are also 

increasing lending through the use of SBA guarantees.  Finally, the more noticeable 

improvement that has already taken place in credit conditions for larger companies should, to 

some degree, pass through in the form of trade credit to the smaller suppliers or distributors for 

the larger firms.   



 

- 9 -

 Still, as with improvement in macroeconomic conditions, the impact of the turnaround in 

bank attitudes and strategies will likely be gradual.  As noted earlier, the January SLOOS also 

revealed that the credit quality of loans to small firms in the fourth quarter of 2009 was worse 

than for loans to larger firms, so many banks may move cautiously in making new loans. 

Additional Steps to Meet the Needs of Creditworthy Small Business Borrowers 

 Despite these prospects for improvement, credit conditions for many small businesses are 

likely to remain challenging this year.  That is why the Federal Reserve has been placing 

particular emphasis on ensuring that its supervision and examination policies do not 

inadvertently impede sound small business lending.  If financial institutions retreat from sound 

lending opportunities because of concerns about criticism from their examiners, their long-term 

interests and those of small businesses and the economy in general could be negatively affected, 

as businesses are unable to maintain or expand payrolls or to make otherwise profitable and 

productive investments. 

 On February 5, the banking agencies issued guidance to examiners that reinforced a 

simple message--institutions should strive to meet the credit needs of creditworthy small 

business borrowers, and the supervisory agencies will not hinder those efforts.3  For the reasons 

noted earlier, we recognize that the ongoing financial and economic stress has resulted in a 

decrease in credit availability, including loans to small businesses, and has prompted institutions 

to review their lending practices.  Although current loss rates would indicate that a measure of 

tightening was appropriate and necessary, some institutions may have become overly cautious in 

their lending practices.  Thus, while prudence must remain the watchword for both banks and

their supervisors, we do not want our examiners to take an overly mechanistic approach to 

evaluating small business lending.   

 The Federal Reserve has directed examiners to be mindful of the effects of excessive 

credit tightening on the broader economy.  As a general matter, we do not expect examiners to 

adversely classify loans based solely on a decline in collateral value where, for example, the 

borrower has stable revenue streams and thus the ability to repay the loan.  We have 

implemented training for examiners and outreach to the banking industry to underscore this 

expectation.  We are aware that bankers, as well as examiners, may become overly conservative 

in an attempt to ameliorate past weaknesses in lending practices, and are working to emphasize 

that it is in all parties’ best interests to continue making loans to creditworthy borrowers.   

The most recent guidance is the latest in a series of actions taken by the Federal Reserve 

and the other banking agencies to support sound bank lending and the credit intermediation 

process.  In an effort to encourage prudent CRE loan workouts, the Federal Reserve led the 

development of interagency guidance issued in October 2009 regarding CRE loan restructurings 

and workouts.4  That policy statement provides guidance for examiners and for financial 

institutions who are working with CRE borrowers experiencing diminished operating cash flows, 

depreciated collateral values, or prolonged delays in selling or renting commercial properties, 

particularly as the loans on those properties mature and need to be refinanced.  The statement is 

especially relevant to small businesses because owner-occupied CRE often serves as collateral 

for small business loans.   

Prudent loan workouts are in the best interest of both financial institutions and borrowers, 

particularly during difficult economic conditions.  Accordingly, the CRE policy statement details

risk-management practices for loan workouts that support prudent and pragmatic credit and 

business decision making within the framework of financial accuracy, transparency, and timely 

loss recognition.  We hope that the detailed examples in that guidance will be of particular use to 

examiners, who themselves face the difficult task of assessing bank credit practices in this 

uncertain environment.  

 Immediately after the release of the CRE guidance, the Federal Reserve conducted a 

Systemwide teleconference with examiners to underscore the importance of this new guidance 

and promote its consistent application in all regions.  In conjunction with the other federal and 

state banking agencies, Federal Reserve staff has participated in a number of teleconferences 

with various industry groups to discuss the guidance, which have reached several thousand 

bankers to date.  Examiner training and industry outreach will continue, and specific activities 

related to the guidance issued in early February targeting small businesses will augment existing 

examiner training.   

 In January, the Federal Reserve launched a comprehensive Systemwide training initiative 

to further underscore our expectations regarding CRE.  These initiatives themselves build off of 

guidance that the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies issued in November 2008 

to encourage banks to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers--in a manner consistent with 

safety and soundness--and to take a balanced approach in assessing borrowers’ abilities to repay 

and to make realistic assessments of collateral valuations.5  Achieving this balance will not 

always be easy.  We certainly do not want to lay the seeds for future bank problems by 

encouraging or permitting imprudent lending today.  That is why we have emphasized to both

bankers and our examiners the importance of careful analysis of the circumstances of individual 

borrowers. 

 While aggregate figures are useful to policymakers in assessing overall trends in the 

financial system, they do not tell the whole story.  Determining whether supervisory policies and 

practices are appropriately balanced also requires a close examination of specific circumstances--

for example, through evaluating particular loans that banks were discouraged from making.  

Ongoing outreach will thus be essential as the regulatory agencies and the industry continue to 

work through the many difficult issues brought about by the financial crisis.  Members of the 

Board and senior supervisory staff have met with bankers, including community bankers, to 

elicit examples of supervisory policies or actions that bankers believe may have inhibited 

prudent lending and to discuss in detail some examples of the supervisory agencies’ responses to 

specific lending situations.  It is important that we identify cases in which examiners may be too 

cautious and to further clarify our general guidance.  It is equally important that we reinforce 

those cautious instincts where the circumstances of an application for credit indicate excessive 

risk.  

 In addition to our outreach to banks and bank examiners, the Federal Reserve has 

conducted several forums in recent months to better understand the difficulties faced by small 

businesses.  In mid-November, the Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, in 

conjunction with the SBA, held small business forums in San Francisco and Los Angeles.  We 

are now conducting a series of meetings on small business access to credit hosted by the Reserve 

Banks.  The meetings will be followed by a capstone event at the Board of Governors.  These 

forums examine the evolving difficulties faced by small businesses and will inform additional 

efforts to help this important sector.  Meetings this week focused on minority entrepreneurship 



 

- 13 -

and SBA lending.  Some of these meetings will focus on a specific aspect of small business 

lending such as credit gaps with respect to small business credit products, types of financial 

institutions, or demographic groups (including minority borrowers).  Others will employ a 

standard agenda in different parts of the country to ascertain regional differences in small 

business access to credit and support services.   

 Finally, in your invitation letter you asked that we discuss actions taken by the 

Administration to assist small business owners.  As you know, the Administration has 

undertaken a number of actions aimed at improving small businesses’ access to credit.  Since the 

signing of the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in February 2009, SBA 7(a) and 504 

loan volumes have increased quite substantially relative to the period immediately preceding the 

bill’s passage.  Most recently, the Administration announced a small business lending initiative 

to provide low-cost capital to community banks that submit a plan to increase their small 

business lending and to Community Development Financial Institutions that serve the hardest-hit 

communities.  A number of these small business lending initiatives are new, and their effects on 

small business lending cannot yet be measured.  Nonetheless, a number of programs have been 

established to assist small businesses and the regulatory agencies recently issued guidance that 

strongly encourages banks to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers.  We will closely 

monitor credit conditions to consider whether additional measures may be needed to ensure that 

the funding needs of qualified small businesses are met in the coming months.

Conclusion 

 While financial market conditions have improved in the United States, the overall lending 

environment remains strained, and significant concerns have been raised about the availability of 

credit to small businesses.  The Federal Reserve, in collaboration with the other banking 

agencies, has worked to ensure that the banking system remains safe and sound and is able to 

meet the credit needs of our economy.  We also have aggressively pursued monetary policy 

actions and have provided liquidity to help restore stability to the financial system and support 

the flow of credit to households and businesses. 

 It will take time for the banking industry to fully recover and to serve as a source of 

strength for the real economy.  The Federal Reserve is committed to working with the other 

banking agencies and the Congress to promote the concurrent goals of fostering credit 

availability for creditworthy borrowers and ensuring a safe and sound banking system.  

 Thank you again for your invitation to discuss these important issues at today’s hearing.  

I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.
