Economic and Financial Inclusion in 2011:  What it Means for Americans and our 
Economic Recovery

I wish to thank the New America Foundation, the Center for Financial Security, 

and the Congressional Savings and Ownership Caucus for the invitation to speak at this 

important conference addressing the savings and credit needs of Americans as our 

economy recovers.  It is a pleasure to be here with you today.   

As the mother of three teenagers who are struggling toward adulthood--always 

two steps forward and one step back, or perhaps a couple steps sideways--I inevitably 

think about economic inclusion from the standpoint of young people entering the 

workforce and the adult economy.  And so I ask myself: What does it mean for them to 

be included in the economy? 

Well, obviously I want them to be able to find satisfying, meaningful, and 

decently compensated work.  Surely this is as much a marker of the transition to 

adulthood in our society as registering to vote or earning the all-important driver’s 

license.  We might say that we are not truly included in the economy until we draw our 

first paycheck.  One of the tragedies of our current lingering recession is that so many 

young Americans have not been able to experience the thrilling rite of passage that comes 

with finding a stable and decent-paying job.  And, of course, even beyond the young, 

there are millions of Americans stuck in unemployment lines desperate to find a way 

back into the productive economy.   

The question of employment is not our focus today, but we should pause to 

underscore the promotion-of-maximum-employment imperative of the Federal Reserve’s 

dual mandate.  I believe that this imperative has broad importance in American social and 

economic life.

But economic inclusion also implies a kind of belonging and membership in the 

economy that goes beyond employment.  In the financial and regulatory world, 

“economic inclusion” refers to efforts to expand public access to, and participation in, 

mainstream financial services.  This effective inclusion in the financial marketplace 

depends upon a strong regulatory framework, active market participation, and an 

expansion in public financial literacy.  For the sake of clarity, I will call this meaning 

“financial inclusion,” and proceed on the assumption that it is indispensably important to 

effective navigation of the twists and turns of life in the American economy.  Imagine 

what it would be like, even with a job, if you had no access to banking or credit; if you 

did not understand how mortgages or credit cards work; or if you had no way to save a 

portion of your earnings.  Sadly, there are millions of Americans lingering in these 

margins.  

In my remarks today, I will share my perspective on why broad inclusion matters 

to our economic recovery, the challenges that current economic conditions present to the 

efforts of lower-income Americans to participate in the economy, and the risks we face as 

a country if we understate or misunderstand these challenges.  

Who is Being Excluded? 

Let’s first try to scope who is at risk of being economically excluded.  We start 

with the unemployed.  The latest employment report issued by the Bureau of Labor 

Statistics was bleak.1  U.S. employers in May added only 54,000 non-farm jobs, down 

from 232,000 jobs added in April.  The headline unemployment rate was 9.1 percent in 

May, representing about 13.9 million Americans out of work.

www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm.

Unfortunately, the headline unemployment numbers don’t fully capture the true 

scope of the unemployment problem. There are an additional 8.5 million workers who are 

“part-time-of-necessity” or “underemployed” because their hours have been cut back or 

they are unable to find a full-time job; there are also 1.4 million workers who are 

“marginally attached” to the labor force because, while wanting a job, they have not 

searched for one in the past four weeks; and there are 822,000 “discouraged” workers 

who have given up searching for employment because they do not believe any jobs are 

available for them.2  

So it is not just those who are currently collecting unemployment insurance 

payments who are excluded.  The underemployed, the marginally attached, and the 

discouraged, all of whom are primarily concerned about the security of their jobs, wage 

growth, housing, and the rising cost of living, are also suffering from exclusion from the 

economy of work. 

But most of these people searching for a way back into the employed economy 

are doubly challenged by their ability to access reasonably priced financial products with 

safe features that encourage savings.  Americans have several core financial needs.  They 

need a safe, accessible, and affordable method to deposit or cash checks, receive deposits, 

pay bills, and accrue savings.  They also need access to credit to tide them over before 

their next cash infusion arrives.  They may be coming up short paying their rent, their 

mortgage payment, an emergency medical expense, or an unexpected car repair.  They 

may want access to a savings vehicle that, down the road, will help them pay for these 

items and for education or further training, or to start a business.  And many want some

form of non-cash payment method, such as a credit or debit card, to conduct transactions 

that are difficult or impossible to conduct using cash.  

Products and services that serve these core financial needs are not consistently 

available at affordable rates to all Americans.  Those with low and moderate incomes 

may have insufficient income or assets to meet the relatively high requirements of banks.  

Americans without jobs, or with jobs that have slow wage growth, have little, if any, 

opportunity to establish a credit history that facilitates access to financial services.  

Others, especially in the wake of a recession that put many people out of work and 

homes, may have dents on their credit records that inhibit their ability to borrow on 

affordable terms.  

How the Recession Undermined Financial Inclusion 

The economic crisis has undermined financial inclusion for many Americans.  

Low- and moderate-income families entered the recession with little financial buffer 

against the adverse effects of wage cuts, job loss, and drops in home values.  According 

to the 2007 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), home equity accounted for 75 percent 

of total assets for low- and moderate-income families, which made them extremely 

vulnerable to the eventual housing market collapse.  Sure enough, families in the bottom 

fifth of the income distribution saw an 18 percent drop in median net worth between 2007 

and 2009, going from $8,100 in 2007 to $6,600 by 2009.3,4  Families in the middle of the 

income distribution fared even worse, experiencing a 21 percent decline in the value of

their assets, the highest of any group during the same period.  Combined with widespread 

unemployment, housing and stock price declines, and increasing rates of mortgage 

defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies, the assets of many American families have been 

significantly eroded.  

In addition to losing the value of their savings and assets, a significant number of 

low- and moderate-income families have become financially marginalized as a result of 

the economic crisis.  The percentage of families earning $15,000 per year or less who 

reported that they have no bank account increased between 2007 and 2009 such that more 

than one out of four families were unbanked.5  Families slightly further up the income 

distribution earning between $15,000 and $30,000 per year are also financially 

marginalized: 13 percent report being unbanked and almost 24 percent report being 

underbanked.   

This combination of economic insecurity and financial marginalization has placed 

more low- and moderate-income families right at the well-lit front doorsteps of payday 

lenders and other alternative financial service providers to try to meet their financial 

needs.   

Alternative Financial Services: Convenience vs. Cost 

While alternative financial services may serve the access needs of many 

consumers, they often come at a much higher cost than traditional financial services.  For 

example, the typical payday lender may charge $15 to $20 per $100 borrowed for a two-

week period, translating into annual percentage rates often exceeding 390 percent.

Similarly, check cashers generally charge customers 2 to 3 percent of the amount of a 

check, even for those issued by the government.  It is not hard to see how such fees can 

add up to several hundred dollars per year--real money for any consumer, but as a 

percentage of income, much more costly for those with limited disposable incomes.6   

For some consumers, these services may be seen as more convenient or customer-

friendly than those offered by traditional banks.  But this convenience comes with a hard 

price: it further exacerbates the precarious financial state of many families and, in many 

cases, locks them into a downward cycle of deteriorating finances.  

This is not to say that mainstream financial services are inexpensive.  Free 

checking accounts are quickly disappearing, replaced by accounts with rising fees.  

Overdraft fees on checking accounts can also be pricy, ranging from $10 to $38 with a 

median fee of $27.  These fees are not insignificant, particularly when applied to small 

dollar transactions.7  

In sum, the financial crisis has left many lower- and moderate-income Americans 

in danger. With fewer assets to rely upon and deteriorating credit, many people find it 

harder to enter, or stay in, the financial mainstream.  In analyzing the state of economic 

and financial inclusion, the crisis both expanded the number of Americans excluded from 

the economy and dramatically raised the barriers to enter it. 

Why Does Financial Inclusion Matter?   

Broad financial inclusion is essential because it bolsters American consumption 

and savings, which drives macroeconomic growth.  In order to promote efficient 

economic growth and stability, Americans must have safe and affordable access to the

tools necessary to function in the modern economy.  Congress created the Federal 

Reserve with a view that it should focus on economic growth, so the Federal Reserve has 

a clear interest in promoting a meaningful, broad recovery that is conducted in a safe and 

viable manner.  Affordable, transparently priced, and safe financial products and services 

promote positive outcomes for individual consumers, which in turn supports the growth 

and stability of the overall financial system.   

From the standpoint of the individual, financial inclusion serves as a mild 

counterweight to the growing income and asset inequality in the United States that has 

deepened since the onset of the economic crisis.  While the exact level of inequality is a 

matter of academic debate, the trend across various measures definitely suggests that 

economic disparity has increased over the past 30 years and has accelerated in the past 

decade.   

This phenomenon appears to be driven primarily by the rapid growth in income 

and assets for those in the top 1 percent of the distribution, while most everyone else has 

experienced stagnation.8  This inequality is destabilizing and undermines the ability of 

the economy to grow sustainably and efficiently.  It is associated with increases in crime, 

profound strains on households, lower savings rates, poorer health outcomes, and 

diminished levels of trust in people and institutions. 9  All of these forces drag down 

maximum economic growth and are anathema to the social progress that is part and

parcel of such growth.  These forces also bring people closer to being “scammed” or 

becoming vulnerable to financial schemes that promise quick and easy fixes.  Finding 

ways to help more Americans safely grow their incomes and net worth in real terms 

arguably diminishes the destructive influence of income inequality by giving everyone a 

more secure footing in the economy and the same kind of flexibility and choice available 

to the more affluent. 

Understanding the Impediments to Inclusion 

Understanding the impediments to inclusion for Americans will help 

policymakers to craft effective responses for expanding access to financial services.  As 

just described, first and foremost, people need jobs with compensation that can support 

them and their families and that provide a source of savings and wealth accumulation.  In 

other words, they need to be economically included.  Second, we should examine barriers 

that individual consumers may face.   

For example, a Federal Reserve analysis of the SCF suggests that the primary 

reason individuals do not have a transaction account is a simple lack of trust in financial 

institutions.10  This may originate from negative personal experiences with financial 

institutions since more than half of the unbanked previously held checking accounts.  For 

some immigrants, it may also be due to a more general distrust of financial institutions in 

their country of origin that translates to distrust of U.S. institutions.  

Opportunities for Innovation 

In addition to considering the barriers to accessing transaction, savings, and credit 

products, the discussion of expanding financial inclusion should consider new

Checking Account?”  Journal of Consumer Affairs. 38 (1), 1-34.

opportunities that have the potential to make financial services more broadly available.  

New technology, such as recent advancements in mobile financial services and the 

prepaid card industry, are spurring financial product and service innovation in the private 

sector.  For example, mobile tools promoting ways to improve the financial capabilities 

of, and providing new products and services for, the underbanked are being developed.  

 At the same time, there is interest in the use of prepaid cards that offer the 

payment ability of a debit card, combined with the functions of a checking account, to go 

along with an optional savings feature, as a new product that provides expanded options 

for consumers without traditional bank accounts.  New features, incentives, and discounts 

are beginning to flourish as the prepaid market expands and more competitors enter the 

marketplace.  In fact, at least one prepaid card option encourages timely bill payment and 

savings by providing a discount coupon for prepaying a bill.  For instance, a consumer 

with a $20 utility bill would get a $2 discount for paying the bill early, with the $2 going 

into a savings account.     

 Partnerships are another strategy for delivering financial services at a low cost.  

For instance, the Bank On initiatives being launched throughout the country are an 

example of how partnerships between banks, credit unions, local governments, and non-

profits can lead to the development and deployment of low-cost products that are 

designed to meet the needs of low-income consumers.  Bank On campaigns seek to 

provide pathways to safe, affordable financial products, such as low- and no-cost 

checking accounts that are offered by participating financial institutions.   

   In addition to the wide range of work engaged in by the Federal Reserve System    

that is designed to foster and promote financial inclusion, the System’s Community 


 - 10 -

Development function conducts outreach and acts to foster partnerships and provides 

research and analysis necessary to understand the challenges confronting low- and 

moderate-income individuals and households.  By leveraging our strengths as a research 

institution through the network of Community Development staff in the 12 Reserve 

Banks, their 24 branches, and the Board of Governors, the Federal Reserve System is 

able to monitor and respond to changes in the financial services industry while positively 

influencing policy that impacts low- and moderate-income consumers. 

Changing Demographics 

Our collective work in the realm of financial inclusion is occurring within a 

landscape for financial services and consumer credit that is changing quickly.  Racial and 

ethnic diversification of the country presents opportunities for financial service providers 

that are attentive to the changing financial needs and preferences of consumers.  Rising 

immigration from developing countries, and the associated diversity of experience with 

formal financial services providers, will challenge the financial services industry to be 

more flexible and creative in reaching consumers. 11   

To return to where we began--with teenagers--those of us that are privileged to 

share our days with them know how technology is absolutely central to their lives.  Their 

familiarity and comfort with online interaction, combined with their expectation of 

immediate, continuous, and universally accessible service, will likely inspire changes to 

traditional models of financial service delivery.  Traditional financial service providers 

that fail to keep pace with the latest technological innovations risk losing market share to

innovators in this area.  Signs that younger Americans are more tenuously attached to the 

traditional financial system are already apparent and it is important for policymakers to 

understand the implications of this trend for the financial futures of the next generation.12    

 It may, in fact, turn out to be that the innovations in financial services outside the 

traditional banking system will best address the needs of lower-income Americans.   

However, it is incumbent upon regulators to ensure that these products and services are 

safe, affordable, transparent, and easy to understand, regardless of the provider.  In some 

cases, regulators may need to ban products that are inherently unfair or deceptive.  In all 

cases, regulators must ensure that consumers are afforded meaningful protections with 

respect to any products that are offered in the financial marketplace.  Finally, regulators 

must also actively monitor the consumer financial market to guard against developments 

that might threaten the stability of the overall economy.  

Conclusion 

To conclude, the financial crisis has created new challenges in ongoing efforts to 

expand economic and financial inclusion. The large numbers of unemployed and 

underemployed Americans are at great risk of being unable to access fair, sustainable, 

and affordable financial services.  It is necessary for the strength of our nation’s recovery 

that low- and moderate-income Americans be able to more fully participate in the 

economy, and both policymakers and financial innovators should remain committed to 

the imperative of building upon the progress that has been made.  We need to be prepared 

to foster further innovation and outreach.  Our overall economic stability relies ultimately 

on the collective financial health of all American households, so these are issues in which

we all have a stake.  One of the positive commitments that can emerge from this period of 

terrible economic distress is the determination that all Americans, regardless of income, 

have access to reasonably priced financial products and services so that they may fully 

participate in our nation’s economy and safely build assets for their futures.   

Thank you.
