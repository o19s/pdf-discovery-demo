 On behalf of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, I’d like to 

welcome the participants to today’s hearing.  I’d also like to express my appreciation to 

President Lockhart and our colleagues at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for hosting 

us today. 

 I am pleased to be here at the first in a series of public hearings regarding changes 

to the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).  The Board has scheduled these 

hearings to assess the adequacy of the current mortgage data requirements and examine 

the need to collect additional data from lenders.   

 I would point out that since we began planning these hearings, changes to the 

HMDA data requirements have been included in the regulatory reform bill currently 

being considered by the Congress.  We look forward to hearing your comments regarding 

the implementation of the changes specified in that legislation, as well as changes you 

might recommend based on your experience.   

The proposed legislation also would transfer authority for HMDA rulemaking 

from the Board of Governors to the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  

All information gleaned from these hearings will inform our rulewriting work.  When 

rulemaking authority transfers to the CFPB, be assured that we will hand over the most 

current thinking about changes to Regulation C. 

 Over the course of four public hearings, held throughout the country, we will hear 

from key players in the home mortgage market:  lenders and other market participants, 

academics and researchers, consumer advocacy and community development 

organizations, data experts, regulators, and other public officials.  Although they play 

different roles, all share a common goal:  to ensure that the mortgage market is

responsible, transparent, efficient, and serves the needs of consumers and market 

participants alike.   

 Clearly, the recent mortgage crisis has highlighted the potential ramifications of a 

mortgage market that is not functioning well.  Data do not create the market, but they do 

help us understand what is happening in the market.  HMDA data cannot solve all market 

problems, but the time is ripe for reviewing and revising the data elements, standards, and 

reporting formats. With the benefit of hindsight, we can now answer the question:  Do 

policymakers have adequate and reliable data sufficient to assess market conditions and 

craft policy responses?     

 HMDA has three purposes.  One purpose is to provide the public and government 

officials with data that will help show whether lenders are serving the housing needs of 

the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located.  A second is to help 

government officials target public investment to promote private investment where it is 

needed.  A third purpose is to provide data to assist in identifying possible discriminatory 

lending patterns and facilitate the enforcement of anti-discrimination laws, such as the 

Equal Credit Opportunity Act. 

 Today’s hearing is intended to serve as a venue to:  discuss whether or not the 

2002 revisions to Regulation C  provided useful and accurate information about the 

mortgage market; gather information that will help assess the need for additional data 

elements or improvements; and identify emerging issues in the mortgage market that may 

require additional research.  As I said earlier, we are also interested in any comments on 

the implementation of the HMDA elements of the regulatory reform legislation.

 We have gathered this morning an impressive array of panelists representing a 

spectrum of vantage points.  We look forward to the comments of our panelists today and 

at the upcoming hearings in San Francisco, Chicago, and Washington.  This input, 

together with written comments submitted from the public, will be carefully considered 

as we consider changes to Regulation C.
