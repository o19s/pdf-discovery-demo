Thank you to Professor Scott for inviting me to join this discussion on cross-border 

resolution and risks of fragmentation.  Like many of my international counterparts in the 

audience, I maintain a deep commitment to cross-border banking and efficient movement of 

capital and liquidity, which are important contributors to long-term economic growth.  And it is 

with that commitment in mind that I have considered the topic of today’s conference: “ring-

fencing,” beginning with some reflections on what the term means.  Many here use the term to 

describe local capital and liquidity requirements, which are imposed ex ante on local subsidiaries 

and designed to protect those entities and their creditors from losses.  The term is also used to 

refer to disruptive actions taken by host regulators to seize assets in the moment of crisis.1  This 

type of ring-fencing occurs suddenly and unilaterally. 

Both uses of the term are associated with the risk arising from the stress or failure of a 

global financial institution; however, whether ring-fencing as I first defined it--prepositioning--is 

helpful or harmful in minimizing this risk depends on one’s perspective.  The views of different 

stakeholders tend to vary depending on whether one is seeking to maximize efficient allocation 

of resources in good times or minimize losses in stress and, importantly, whether one is a home 

or host regulator.  

Before the financial crisis, much of our collective orientation was on maximizing the 

efficient flow of capital across the globe.  This should remain a paramount goal.  Yet in the wake 

of the financial crisis, global regulators have understandably also focused on minimizing the cost 

of the failure of a global financial institution by mitigating the impediments to cross-border 

resolution.  The single-point-of-entry (SPOE) and bail-in concepts hold particular promise for

prudential regulatory agency of a foreign branch or subsidiary of the parent bank.

most large global firms.  However, a successful SPOE resolution of a large global firm has not 

yet been attempted and will require close cooperation among a large number of stakeholders, 

including both home and host country regulators.  This cooperation will be based on an 

understanding of separate and mutual interests, not on trust alone.  So while SPOE creates a 

potentially workable framework for resolution, setting the conditions for cooperation is critical.  

I grew up among the ranches of the American West, where we lived by the motto taught to me as 

a young child: trust everyone, but brand your cattle.  This is a theme that will run throughout my 

remarks today.   

In addition to setting the stage for effective cooperation, I will focus specifically on the 

type of ring-fencing that will almost certainly undermine the successful execution of an SPOE 

resolution--namely the disruptive seizure of assets by host regulators in the moment of stress.  As 

with other elements of our regime, I have been considering whether our current prepositioning 

requirements for domestic and foreign firms operating in the United States are both minimizing 

this risk and functioning in an efficient and transparent manner, and I will share some thoughts in 

that regard.  Our vantage point in the United States as a large home and host regulator would 

counsel that it is sensible to find a middle ground and fine tune our approach as we learn more 

and global conditions evolve. 

Resolution Considerations of a Home and Host Regulator 

To enable cooperation and avoid a destabilizing seizure of assets by host regulators, I 

would submit that all jurisdictions must find a balance of flexibility for the parent bank and 

certainty for local stakeholders.  Flexibility, or the ability to allocate capital and liquidity to 

different parts of the group on an as-needed basis, helps to meet unexpected demands on 

resources and reduces the risk of misallocation and inefficient use of resources.  Certainty, or the 


- 3 - 
 


local prepositioning of capital and liquidity to ensure a firm can satisfy local claimants under 

stressful conditions, helps to promote cooperation in the context of a cross-border resolution and 

avoid incentives for more drastic action by host authorities.   

One’s assessment of the optimal balance, as I alluded to earlier, can depend significantly 

on where one sits in the regulatory constellation.  The home regulator, by nature, will logically 

prefer flexibility in a resolution; consolidated capital and liquidity requirements are most 

effective if resources can be freely allocated around the consolidated firm where and when they 

are needed.  Flexibility also helps offset the uncertainty in forecasting the location within the 

consolidated firm where stress may arise.  Yet I would also argue that home regulators should 

recognize host jurisdictions may take action to restrict the flow of resources, or worse yet, 

demand resources in the moment of crisis, even if the stress does not originally emanate from 

their location.  Such actions tend to both limit the flexibility of the home regulator and 

undermine cooperation in times of stress.  

The host regulator, by nature, will prefer the certainty that resources will be available to 

satisfy local customers and counterparties under stressful conditions.  This is particularly the case 

if the risk of default or the potential local loss given default of a foreign firm is high, and the 

tolerance for a government-assisted intervention for foreign banks is low.  However, the host 

regulator should also recognize that it is ultimately in its interest for the SPOE resolution of the 

foreign bank to be successful and, given the uncertainty of the circumstances or location of 

losses that emerge in an actual stress, adequate flexibility for the parent to deploy resources 

where needed is likewise in the host regulator’s interest.   

A global bank has other stakeholders who have preferences regarding flexibility or 

certainty and can take actions that can potentially destabilize the firm.  For instance, parent

company debt and equity holders may prefer less prepositioning, while local creditors and 

financial market utilities may prefer more.  These other stakeholders can act in ways that can be 

destabilizing.  Building a system that is transparent and is perceived by stakeholders as allocating 

losses fairly is key in this regard.  

Finally, I would like to note that the considerations of policymakers in determining the 

right balance of flexibility and certainty may differ depending on whether the resource at issue is 

capital or liquidity.  In resolution, the most important difference between capital and liquidity is 

the speed with which financial stress can appear.  Liquidity needs are sudden and tend to 

manifest in all areas of the organization, and the consequences of not meeting liquidity demand--

an immediate default on an obligation--can be grave.  Capital needs, however, may be more 

localized and slower to evolve but are foundational to the execution of an SPOE resolution.  It is 

unlikely that host regulators would be comfortable cooperating in an SPOE resolution strategy 

without some confidence in the viability of the entities in their jurisdictions.    

U.S. Approach 

Historically, the United States and the United Kingdom have been in a unique position of 

having large interests as both home country and host country regulators of internationally active 

banks.  Soon, the European Union is likely to assume this privilege as well.  We understand that 

any requirements we impose on foreign banks operating in the United States may well be 

imposed on U.S. firms operating abroad.  In addition, we are operating under a veil of ignorance, 

as we don’t know whether the next firm in distress will be a U.S. firm operating globally or a 

foreign firm with U.S. operations.  This provides us with strong incentives to view the risks from 

both sides.

As the home regulator to U.S. global systemically important banking organizations (G-

SIBs), we and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) have used the living wills 

process to set the expectation that a firm appropriately balance prepositioned and centrally 

managed resources.2  This expectation is based on the premise that the optimal balance will 

depend on factors such as the firm’s structure and the host jurisdictions in which the firm 

operates.  As such, the Board and the FDIC have asked U.S. G-SIBs to analyze and anticipate 

capital and liquidity resources needed to ensure the continued operation of material entities in 

resolution.  Regarding capital, the positioning of a U.S. G-SIB’s internal total loss absorbing 

capacity (TLAC) should reflect a balance of certainty--prepositioning internal TLAC directly at 

material entities--and flexibility--holding recapitalization resources at the parent, known as 

contributable resources--to meet unanticipated losses at material entities.3   

Regarding liquidity, the Board and FDIC expect a U.S. G-SIB to appropriately estimate 

and maintain sufficient liquidity for material entities, an expectation known as Resolution 

Liquidity Adequacy and Positioning, or RLAP.4  RLAP expectations are intended to be designed 

so that liquidity is not “double counted” among home and host jurisdictions, to provide 

transparency into the location of liquidity across the firm’s material entities, and to ensure that 

liquidity can flow where needed with minimal potential disruption.  The RLAP approach is

submit an annual resolution plan, or living will, that describes the company’s strategy for rapid and orderly 
resolution under bankruptcy in the event of material financial distress or failure of the company.  If the Federal 
Reserve and the FDIC determine that a firm’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate an orderly 
resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the agencies, acting jointly, may impose more stringent prudential 
requirements on the firm until it remediates identified deficiencies.

aimed at ensuring that surpluses in one host jurisdiction generally are not relied upon to meet 

deficits in another host jurisdiction, given the confusion and vulnerabilities such reliance can 

cause in an actual stress.  Specifically, a firm should be able to measure the stand-alone liquidity 

position of each material entity and ensure that liquidity is readily available either at the parent or 

at that entity to meet any deficits.5  As with capital, firms are expected to have a balance of 

prepositioned and centrally managed liquidity--specifically, by balancing the certainty associated 

with holding liquidity directly at material entities against the flexibility provided by holding 

high-quality liquid assets at the parent available to meet unanticipated outflows at material 

entities.  

As a host regulator, our approach to local capital and liquidity regulations of foreign 

banks with large U.S. operations is motivated by the lessons of the recent financial crisis, where 

many foreign banks operating in the United States suffered severe stress and survived only with 

extraordinary support from the United States and their home country governments.  In addition 

to increasing the resiliency of the U.S. operations of foreign banks, our approach also reflects 

both resolution and competitive equity considerations.   

From a resolution perspective, our rules seek to ensure that there are sufficient resources 

in the United States today to ensure that we, as a host regulator, are well positioned to cooperate 

with a home country authority in the event a firm experiences material stress or failure.  Our 

rules also ensure that we do not have a strong incentive to limit flows or seek additional 

resources in the moment of crisis, which could be highly destabilizing in a stress event.

From a competitive equity standpoint, we believe that U.S. subsidiaries of foreign banks 

should operate on a level playing field with their domestic counterparts.  This is generally 

consistent with the long-standing treatment of large and complex bank and nonbank subsidiaries 

around the world.   

As such, our rules subject a large foreign bank to the same capital and liquidity 

requirements as domestic bank holding companies by requiring the foreign bank to hold its U.S. 

subsidiaries through a U.S. intermediate holding company (IHC) and imposing capital and 

liquidity requirements to the IHC.  At the same time, we have adjusted our approach for the U.S. 

branches of a foreign bank with a large U.S. presence in recognition that branches are subject to 

a narrower set of permissible activities and operate as a direct extension of the parent bank.  For 

these U.S. branches, we have imposed local liquidity requirements in light of the liquidity 

vulnerabilities that many U.S. branches of foreign banks experienced in the crisis, but no 

separate capital requirements.   

For IHCs that are subsidiaries of foreign-owned G-SIBs, the Federal Reserve requires 

such a firm to issue a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments to its foreign parent, 

known as internal TLAC, including a minimum amount of unsecured long-term debt.6  In the 

event that an IHC was experiencing significant financial distress, the internal TLAC could be 

used to replenish the IHC’s equity and maintain its solvency.  The U.S. implementation of 

internal TLAC is modeled on the internal TLAC framework developed by the Financial Stability 

Board (FSB), which includes a calibration of the amount of loss-absorbing resources that should

be prepositioned in a given jurisdiction.7  Specifically, the FSB contemplates that internal TLAC 

requirements of a subsidiary of a foreign bank expected to be resolved through SPOE would be 

calibrated at 75 to 90 percent of the external TLAC requirement that would apply to the 

subsidiary if it were to be separately resolved.  In implementing the TLAC standards in the 

United States, the Board calibrated the internal TLAC requirement for IHCs of foreign-owned  

G-SIBs at the high end of the FSB range, at around 90 percent.  

Adjustments to the Current Regime 

 There are two principal points I have been making today.  The first is that some amount 

of local capital and liquidity prepositioning can reduce the incentives for damaging and 

unpredictable seizures of resources by local regulators during times of stress--thus actually 

reducing the likelihood that improvised, beggar-thy-neighbor ring-fencing would frustrate 

completion of a successful SPOE resolution in the future.  As we learned long ago out West, the 

branding of cattle creates the possibility of trust.   

The second point, however, is equally important: the best prepositioning structure is not 

an eternal verity mathematically deducible from first principles, but it is instead a practical 

balance designed to promote cooperation among humans, and any such balance is likely to be 

improvable with experience, reflection, and debate.  We are interested in views from the firms 

and the public on how the regimes can be improved, and we expect to invite public comment on 

our living will guidance for U.S. and foreign firms in the near future.  In addition, we are 

currently weighing the costs and benefits of our current approach of directing firms to determine

the appropriate amount of prepositioned capital and liquidity.  We are also considering whether 

formalizing resolution capital and liquidity requirements through a rulemaking process would 

improve the predictability and transparency of our approach. 

We continue to believe that the IHC and attendant requirements are appropriate for 

foreign banks with large U.S. operations.  However, in light of our experience with these 

structures, I believe we should consider whether the internal TLAC calibration for IHCs could be 

adjusted to reflect the practice of other regulators without adversely affecting resolvability and 

U.S. financial stability.  The current calibration is at the top end of the scale set forth by the FSB, 

and willingness by the United States to reconsider its calibration may prompt other jurisdictions 

to do the same, which could better the prospects of successful resolution for both foreign G-SIBs 

operating in the United States, and for U.S. G-SIBs operating abroad.  Alternatively, it may be 

possible to streamline the elements of our resolution loss absorbency regime, which include both 

TLAC and long-term debt requirements.  I will be recommending to my colleagues that we look 

closely at these possibilities in the coming weeks and seek comment on ways to further improve 

this framework. 

Conclusion 

We are committed to working with other jurisdictions to continue to build the foundation 

of the SPOE resolution framework.  In addition to finding the appropriate balance of flexibility 

and certainty that I have discussed, we continue to advocate for increasing the standardization in 

the global implementation of the regulatory capital rules, improving host supervisors’ 

transparency into the global liquidity and capital positions of a G-SIB on a consolidated and 

deconsolidated basis, and addressing impediments to a successful SPOE resolution.  As with all 

regulations, we will be open to considering adjustments that would improve transparency and

efficiency and will continue to reassess our regime as we make advancements in developing the 

cross-border resolution framework.
