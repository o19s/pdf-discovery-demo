Thank you, and let me say what an honor it is, as an alumna of this great 

university, to be here today and part of this important occasion.   

As we celebrate the 125th anniversary of women being admitted to Brown, it 

seems appropriate to reflect on the progress that women have achieved in the intervening 

years.  Since 1891, women have made tremendous strides in their ability to pursue their 

dreams of education and meaningful work and to support themselves and their families.  

In pursuing these goals, women have helped improve working conditions for all workers 

and have been a major factor in America’s prosperity over the past century and a quarter.   

Despite this progress, evidence suggests that many women remain unable to 

achieve their goals.  The gap in earnings between women and men, although smaller than 

it was years ago, is still significant; women continue to be underrepresented in certain 

industries and occupations; and too many women struggle to combine aspirations for 

work and family.  Further advancement has been hampered by barriers to equal 

opportunity and workplace rules and norms that fail to support a reasonable work-life 

balance.  If these obstacles persist, we will squander the potential of many of our citizens 

and incur a substantial loss to the productive capacity of our economy at a time when the 

aging of the population and weak productivity growth are already weighing on economic 

growth.   

To enliven the history I will present today, I will include the experiences of 

women graduates of this institution, in most cases in their own words, as related in oral 

histories preserved by Brown.1  Among these alumnae, I am proud to say, is a member of 

my own family who was an early graduate of Pembroke, Elizabeth Stafford Hirschfelder

of the Class of 1923.  Her career and achievements as a mathematician embody both the 

opportunities that opened for Pembroke graduates in the decades after she left here and 

the limitations many women faced and the compromises she, like so many others, was 

forced to make.  

A Historical Perspective on Women in the Labor Force 

From the time that Brown began to accept women and into the 1920s, most 

women in the United States did not work outside the home, and those who did were 

primarily young and unmarried.  In that era, just 20 percent of all women were “gainful 

workers,” as the Census Bureau then categorized labor force participation outside the 

home, and only 5 percent of those married were categorized as such.2  Of course, these 

statistics somewhat understate the contributions of married women to the economy 

beyond housekeeping and childrearing, since women’s work in the home often included 

work in family businesses and the home production of goods, such as agricultural 

products, for sale.  Also, the aggregate statistics obscure the differential experience of 

women by race.  African American women were about twice as likely to participate in the 

labor force as were white women at the time, largely because they were more likely to 

remain in the labor force after marriage.3   

                                                 
2 My discussion of the history of female labor force participation draws heavily on the pioneering work of 
Claudia Goldin, including her 2006 Ely Lecture “The Quiet Revolution that Transformed Women’s 
Employment, Education, and Family” to the American Economic Association and her 1990 work 
Understanding the Gender Gap:  An Economic History of American Women, from which the statistics on 
female labor force participation from the late 19th century until the mid-20th century are drawn.  A 
thorough discussion of the quality of these data and their usefulness in making comparisons over time is 
included in that work. 
3 The higher participation rates of African American women have been attributed to different cultural 
norms that developed during slavery and the legacy of slavery, which left blacks impoverished and with 
low levels of education, making women’s wages an important source of family income (Boustan and 
Collins, 2013; Goldin, 1977).

What was true for women in general was also true of the early graduates of what 

was then called the Women’s College, the large majority of whom got married, raised 

families, and did not pursue careers.  The fact that many women left work upon marriage 

reflected cultural norms, the nature of the work available to them, and legal strictures.  

The occupational choices of those young women who did work were severely 

circumscribed.  Most women lacked significant education--only 54 percent of girls aged 

5 to 19 were enrolled in school in 1890.4  And women with little education mostly toiled 

as piece workers in factories or as domestic workers, jobs that were dirty and often 

unsafe.  Educated women, like those who attended Brown’s Women’s College, were 

scarce.  Fewer than 2 percent of all 18- to 24-year-olds were enrolled in an institution of 

higher education, and just one-third of those were women.5  Such women did not have to 

perform manual labor, but their choices were likewise constrained.  Edna McDonald was 

a graduate of the Class of 1919, and in her oral history, she summed up the opportunities 

for her and her classmates:  “Let’s be frank,” she said. “What choices did women have?  

Teaching.  You could teach.  You could be a lab technician.  Or you could go into office 

work and be a secretary.  Those were the only real choices.”  Margery Chittenden 

Leonard graduated from Pembroke in 1929 and went on to earn a J.D. as the only woman 

in her class at Boston University--after two others withdrew.  And with that law degree, 

her first job was as a secretary, and she continued to struggle to find work as a lawyer.  In 

her oral history, Doris Madeline Hopkins, a 1928 graduate, talked about the opportunity

that she had to work, but also about being told she had to leave her job once she got 

married.  Indeed, at the time, marriage bars were widespread.6   

There were notable exceptions, such as, of course, Mary Emma Woolley, a Brown 

graduate who went on to serve as the president of Mount Holyoke College, and Ethel 

Robinson, the first black woman to graduate from Brown, who taught English at Howard 

University.  Helen Butts, from the Class of 1928, taught natural sciences at Smith and 

later zoology at Wellesley, the beginning of a long and productive career as a biological 

researcher.  Another exception was Betty Stafford, the aunt of my husband, George.  She 

grew up in Providence, earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees at Brown in mathematics 

and then rather adventurously headed west, teaching at two universities in Texas in the 

1920s before completing her Ph.D. and then teaching at the University of Wisconsin.   

Despite the widespread sentiment against women, particularly married women, 

working outside the home and with the limited opportunities available to them, women 

did enter the labor force in greater numbers over this period, with participation rates 

reaching nearly 50 percent for single women by 1930 and nearly 12 percent for married 

women.  This rise suggests that while the incentive, and in many cases the imperative, 

remained for women to drop out of the labor market at marriage when they could rely on 

their husband’s income, mores were changing.  Indeed, these years overlapped with the 

so-called first wave of the women’s movement, when women came together to agitate for 

change on a variety of social issues, including suffrage and temperance, and which 

culminated in the ratification of the 19th amendment in 1920 guaranteeing women the 

right to vote.

Between the 1930s and mid-1970s, women’s participation in the economy 

continued to rise, with the gains primarily owing to an increase in work among married 

women.  By 1970, 50 percent of single women and 40 percent of married women were 

participating in the labor force.7  Several factors contributed to this rise.  First, with the 

advent of mass high school education, graduation rates rose substantially.8  At the same 

time, new technologies contributed to an increased demand for clerical workers, and 

these jobs were increasingly taken on by women.  Moreover, because these jobs tended to 

be cleaner and safer, the stigma attached to work for a married woman diminished.  And 

while there were still marriage bars that forced women out of the labor force, these 

formal barriers were gradually removed over the period following World War II.  

Another innovation was the introduction in the late 1940s of part-time schedules, which 

combined with the proliferation of modern appliances to make it more feasible for 

married women to work outside the home.9   

Over the decades from 1930 to 1970, increasing opportunities also arose for 

highly educated women, such as the graduates of what was by then called Pembroke 

College, to work in professions.  That said, early in that period, most women still 

expected to have short careers, and women were still largely viewed as secondary earners 

whose husbands’ careers came first.  Thus, while it was becoming more common for 

women such as Betty Stafford to teach at colleges and universities, their career prospects 

were not the same as those for men.  After earning her Ph.D. at Wisconsin, Betty married 

a fellow student and over the next decade coauthored five important papers with him and 

                                                 
7 Note that for the 1970s and beyond, the participation rate is calculated as a share of those aged 16 and 
older, whereas for earlier years it is calculated as a share of those aged 15 and older.

a well-regarded reference work.  But, while her husband progressed from instructor to 

professor at Wisconsin, Betty worked as an instructor on an ad hoc basis.  During World 

War II, while he worked for the government in Washington and New York, Betty stayed 

in Madison, teaching math to servicemen.  When he took a job teaching in California 

after the war, they divorced, and it was only then that she was a given a position as 

assistant professor. 

As time progressed, attitudes about women working and their employment 

prospects did change.  As women gained experience in the labor force, they increasingly 

saw that they could balance work and family.  A new model of the two-income family 

emerged.10  Some women began to attend college and graduate school with the 

expectation of working, whether or not they planned to marry and have families, as did 

Rita Schorr-Germain, an immigrant who survived Auschwitz, graduated from Pembroke 

in 1953, and went on to teach European history while her husband also had a successful 

academic career.  In her oral history, Rita says she was encouraged by many Brown 

professors and never considered the possibility that her gender would stand in the way of 

an academic career, a shift in outlook that was becoming increasingly common in the 

1950s.  As did most women’s colleges at the time, Pembroke continued to produce 

nurses, schoolteachers, and social workers, and many women who worked only until they 

married and had children.  But, from the late 1950s on, it also increasingly graduated 

writers, doctors, lawyers, diplomats, physicians, psychotherapists, and archeologists, and, 

                                                 
10 For instance, although many women who had joined the war effort in the 1940s were fired at the end of 
the war, as the Korean War effort picked up and the demand for the labor of women rose, women, who had 
learned that they could combine work and family were ready to reenter the labor force, so that by the early 
1950s female labor force participation resumed its war-time high (Kessler-Harris, 1982, pp. 302-03).  
Moreover, evidence suggests that sons whose mothers increased their labor force participation in the wake 
of World War II had wives who were more likely to work (Fernández, Fogli, and Olivette, 2004).

in 1959, the first female faculty member of Brown University.  Among those women 

fortunate to attend Pembroke in this era of dramatic change was me.  I enrolled at Brown 

fully planning to attend graduate school and have a career, as did many of my classmates 

in the Class of 1967.   

By the 1970s, a dramatic change in women’s work lives was under way.  In the 

period after World War II, many women had not expected that they would spend as much 

of their adult lives working as turned out to be the case.  By contrast, in the 1970s young 

women more commonly expected that they would spend a substantial portion of their 

lives in the labor force, and they prepared for it, increasing their educational attainment 

and taking courses and college majors that better equipped them for careers as opposed to 

just jobs.   

In surveys of young people about their expectations of their futures, young 

women during this era increasingly placed an emphasis on career success.11  Susan 

Graber Slusky of the Class of 1971 said in her oral history that she chose Pembroke for 

Brown’s excellence in chemistry and physics, because she was already planning the 

career she went on to have as a researcher.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, this is also the period 

in which many all-male colleges admitted women or combined their women’s and men’s 

undergraduate schools, as Brown did when it merged Pembroke and Brown College 

in 1971. 

These changes in attitudes and expectations were supported by other changes 

under way in society.  Workplace protections were enhanced through the passage of the 

Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978 and the recognition of sexual harassment in the

workplace.  Access to birth control increased, which allowed married couples greater 

control over the size of their families and young women the ability to delay marriage and 

to plan children around their educational and work choices.12  And in 1974, women 

gained, for the first time, the right to apply for credit in their own name without a male 

co-signer.13 

By the early 1990s, the labor force participation rate of prime working-age 

women--those between the ages of 25 and 54--reached just over 74 percent, compared 

with roughly 93 percent for prime working-age men.  By then, the share of women going 

into the traditional fields of teaching, nursing, social work, and clerical work declined, 

and more women were becoming doctors, lawyers, managers, and, yes, professors.  As 

women increased their education and joined industries and occupations formerly 

dominated by men, the gap in earnings between women and men began to close 

significantly.14  

Positive Spillovers from Women’s Increased Participation in the Workforce 

Looking back, the story of the past 125 years is one of slow but steady progress 

toward women’s full participation in the economy and the fulfillment of their career 

goals.  Unfortunately, the success of women has often been seen as coming at the 

expense of men.  Indeed, regularly in the late 19th and 20th centuries there were calls to 

protect men from women’s entry into the labor force.  The early female graduates of 

Brown faced such attitudes from fellow students and even from faculty.  Ruth Pederson, a 

                                                 
12 See, for example, Bailey (2010) and Goldin and Katz (2002). 
13 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, passed in 1974, prohibited discrimination in the provision of credit on 
the basis of gender, race, religion, marital status and national origin.  It also disallowed credit providers 
from asking women about their plans for future children.

member of the Class of 1919, said some professors did not want to teach women and 

prohibited women from taking their classes.  Margery Leonard remembered one Boston 

University professor who urged her to drop out of law school.  When she refused, this 

professor punished her by forcing her to recite the details of rape and seduction cases 

before her jeering, stomping classmates.  And it wasn’t only men who had this attitude.  

Among the women who were fighting for better labor standards early in the 20th century, 

many were heavily influenced by elite cultural standards that viewed a woman’s place as 

in the home and argued that men should be paid a “family wage” that would allow them 

to support their family singlehandedly--a standard that many working-class families 

could not afford.  Moreover, many of the labor protections promoted to protect women 

were often based on theories about women’s weaker nature, and these protections served 

to circumscribe their work.15  During the Great Depression, limiting women’s role in the 

workforce was considered a way to address the high rates of unemployment, although the 

experience of those years showed the importance of women in supporting their families 

financially.16  Similarly, women who had successfully worked during World War II, 

either as part of the war effort or to support their families while their husbands were 

fighting, often were pushed out of their jobs to make room for returning soldiers.17  

After the war and then single, my relative, Betty Stafford, remained an assistant 

professor at the University of Wisconsin despite an enviable body of research.  She 

married another Wisconsin professor, an eminent chemist, and collaborated with him on 

his research.  But, in 1954, she gave up her assistant professorship, she said, to be able to

accompany her husband on his frequent international travels.  Betty later moved with her 

husband to California, and after his death, she endowed a graduate fellowship in the 

sciences and a prize in theoretical chemistry.  Although Betty’s accomplishments were 

considerable, against the backdrop of increasing opportunity for women over her lifetime 

I believe that Betty Stafford Hirschfelder was denied opportunities and greater success 

simply because she was a woman.   

Despite the fears of some that women entering into the workforce would crowd 

out men, the evidence shows that the rise in women’s participation has contributed to 

widespread improvements in the safety and productivity of our workplaces, to the health 

of families, and to the macroeconomic success that our country has enjoyed over the past 

125 years.   

In the first decades of the 20th century, the struggle to improve the working 

conditions of young women drawn into factories was a pillar of the overall movement 

toward improved labor standards.  Women’s demands for safer factories, humane 

workweeks, and higher pay, which were often pursued through organizing and striking, 

contributed substantially to the social upheaval and public debate of that period that 

eventually led to the passage of stronger labor standards.  These efforts also produced 

generations of women who went on to be leaders in the broader labor movement and in 

the broader movements for equality. 

The rise in female labor force participation was an early focus of and helped 

establish the fields of statistics and labor economics in their modern incarnations.  Carroll 

Wright, the first commissioner of what is now known as the Bureau of Labor Statistics 

and who established the high standards for data collection and analysis for which the 


 - 11 - 

bureau is known, devoted his agency’s fourth annual report, for the year 1888, to the 

topic of Working Women in Large Cities.18  Moreover, the issues surrounding women’s 

work, such as the minimum wage, pay equity, and maximum workweeks, were topics of 

great interest to early practitioners of labor economics.19 

It is often said that we should welcome women’s presence in the workplace 

because it allows us to capitalize on the talents of our entire population, and this is 

certainly true.  But it is also good business.  A number of studies on how groups perform 

indicate that workforces that vary on dimensions such as gender, race, and ethnicity 

produce better decisionmaking processes and better outcomes.20 

Evidence also suggests that women’s work has positive spillovers to their family 

lives and to the success of their children, which in turn benefits all of society.  It is a well-

established finding in the literature on development that maternal education and work are 

positively associated with better health and educational outcomes for children.21  A 

recent meta-study also suggests that children in the United States with working mothers 

do as well if not better in school, both academically and behaviorally, than children with 

mothers that stay home full time.  This effect is particularly strong for families that have 

fewer social and economic resources, including single-parent families.22  As time goes 

on, girls with working mothers are more likely to be employed and hold supervisory 

positions, and they earn somewhat more.  In addition, sons raised in families with

working mothers assume greater childcare responsibilities as adults than sons whose 

mothers did not work.23  

This is not to say that children do not need attention from both parents to develop 

into academically successful and socially well-adjusted adults--they certainly do.  Also, 

as I will discuss, women are making choices that reflect their desire to balance work and 

family.  These findings bear on the question of how best to support women’s work 

through public policies aimed at helping women and men better manage work and family.   

From a macroeconomic perspective, women’s incorporation into the economy 

contributed importantly to the rapid rise in economic output and well-being over the 

20th century.  Between 1948 and 1990, the rise in female participation contributed about 

1/2 percentage point per year to the potential growth rate of real gross domestic 

product.24  And this estimate does not take into account the effect of the increases in 

women’s education and work experience that also occurred over that period and boosted 

their productivity.  In addition, since 1979, women have accounted for a majority of the 

rise in real household income.  In dollar terms, the gains were greatest for households in 

the top third of the earnings distribution, but without the increase in women’s earnings, 

families in the bottom and middle thirds of the distribution would have experienced 

declines.25  

Remaining Challenges and Some Possible Solutions 

I have argued thus far that we, as a country, have reaped great benefits from the 

increasing role that women have played in the economy.  But evidence suggests that

barriers to women’s continued progress remain.  The participation rate for prime 

working-age women peaked in the late 1990s and currently stands at about 75 percent.26  

Of course, women, particularly those with lower levels of education, have been affected 

by the same economic forces that have been pushing down participation among men, 

including technical change and globalization. 27  However, women’s participation 

plateaued at a level well below that of prime working-age men, which stands at over 

88 percent.  While some married women choose not to work, the size of this disparity 

should lead us to examine the extent to which structural problems, such as a lack of equal 

opportunity and challenges to combining work and family, are holding back women’s 

advancement. 

As I mentioned earlier, the gap in earnings between men and women has 

narrowed substantially, but progress has slowed lately, and women working full time still 

earn about 17 percent less than men, on average, each week.28  Even when we compare 

men and women in the same or similar occupations who appear nearly identical in 

background and experience, a gap of about 10 percent typically remains.29  As such, we 

cannot rule out that gender-related impediments hold back women, including outright 

                                                 
26 The labor force participation rate for all women declined from a peak of 60 percent in 1999 and 2000 and 
now stands a bit below 57 percent.  However, as has been documented elsewhere, much of the decline for 
all women can be explained by the aging of the baby boomers into their retirement years and lower 
participation among teens and young adults.  It is also possible that the labor force participation rate is still 
being held down a bit by the waning effects of the Great Recession.  Aaronson and others (2014).

therein. 
28 Blau and Kahn (2016). 
29 Manning and Swaffield (2008) find that although men and women enter the British labor force earning 
the same amount, among those who worked continuously and full time for 10 years, women would still 
earn 8 percent less than men, even if they have the same personality traits, were childless, and profess no 
interest in having children.  Also see Blau and Kahn (2016) and Noonan, Corcoran, and Courant (2005).

discrimination, attitudes that reduce women’s success in the workplace, and an absence 

of mentors. 

Recent research has shown that although women now enter professional schools 

in numbers nearly equal to men, they are still substantially less likely to reach the highest 

echelons of their professions.30  For instance, 47 percent of students at top-50 law schools 

are female, and women obtain 40 percent of M.B.A.’s from top programs.  Nonetheless, 

women are still poorly represented among corporate CEOs, as partners in top law firms, 

and as executives in finance.31  Even in my own field of economics, women constitute 

only about one-third of Ph.D. recipients, a number that has barely budged in two 

decades.32  This lack of success in climbing the professional ladder would seem to 

explain why the wage gap actually remains largest for those at the top of the earnings 

distribution.33   

One of the primary factors contributing to the failure of these highly skilled 

women to reach the tops of their professions and earn equal pay is that top jobs in fields 

such as law and business require longer workweeks and penalize taking time off.  This 

would have a disproportionately large effect on women, who continue to bear the lion’s 

share of domestic and child-rearing responsibilities.34  Within academia, the short 

timeframe in which assistant professors have to prove themselves good candidates for

tenure by publishing typically overlaps with the period in which many women 

contemplate starting a family, forcing difficult trade-offs.35   

Employers may require the long hours and short absences for good reasons--for 

instance, the work may involve relationships with clients or accumulating a significant 

amount of knowledge about a deal or case in a condensed period of time.  If it is costly 

for employees to share information and split the work, then there would be a high 

premium, in the form of compensation, for those who can work the long hours.36  

Workplaces where the income of employees depends on the effort of co-workers, such as 

law partnerships, also have an incentive to require long workweeks.37   

But however sensible such arrangements may be from a business perspective, it 

can be difficult for women to meet the demands in these fields once they have children.  

The very fact that these types of jobs require such long hours likely discourages some 

women--as well as men--from pursuing these career tracks.  Advances in technology 

have facilitated greater work-sharing and flexibility in scheduling, and there are further 

opportunities in this direction.38  Economic models also suggest that while it can be 

difficult for any one employer to move to a model with shorter hours, if many firms were 

to change their model, they and their workers could all be better off.39 

Of course, most women are not employed in fields that require such long hours or 

that impose such severe penalties for taking time off.  But the difficulty of balancing 

work and family is a widespread problem.  In fact, the recent trend in many occupations 

                                                 
35 Unfortunately, in contrast to some of the successful gender neutral policies I discuss below, efforts to 
address the tenure problem by giving all new parents extra time before the tenure decision has actually had 
the effect of reducing female tenure rates and raising those of men. Antecol, Bedrard and Stearns, (2016).

is to demand complete scheduling flexibility, which can result in too few hours of work 

for those with family demands and can make it difficult to schedule childcare.40  Reforms 

that encourage companies to provide some predictability in schedules, cross-train 

workers to perform different tasks, or require a minimum guaranteed number of hours in 

exchange for flexibility could improve the lives of workers holding such jobs.  Another 

problem is that in most states, childcare is affordable for fewer than half of all families.41  

And just 5 percent of workers with wages in the bottom quarter of the wage distribution 

have jobs that provide them with paid family leave.42  This circumstance puts many 

women in the position of having to choose between caring for a sick family member and 

keeping their jobs.   

In this context, it is useful to compare the workforce experiences of American 

women to those in other advanced economies.  In 1990, the labor force participation rate 

in the United States of prime working-age women, 74 percent, was higher than in all but 

a few industrialized nations.  But in the intervening years, while the participation rate of 

U.S. women was roughly stable, elsewhere it increased steadily, and by 2010 the United 

States fell to 17th place out of 22 advanced economies with respect to female labor force 

participation.43  A number of studies have examined the role of various public policies in 

explaining patterns in female labor force participation across countries.  These studies 

find that policy differences--in particular, the expansion of paid leave following 

childbirth, steps to improve the availability and affordability of childcare, and increased 

availability of part-time work--go a long way toward explaining the divergence between

advanced economies.44  Evidence suggests that if the United States had policies in place 

such as those employed in many European countries, female labor force participation 

could be as high as 82 percent.45  

However, these policies entail tradeoffs.  Women in other advanced economies 

are more likely than women in the United States to be employed part time, which could 

reflect a greater ease in arranging flexible schedules and more time with family, but it 

also comes with costs, including a wage penalty and fewer opportunities for training and 

advancement.  Such findings raise the question of whether the policies enacted overseas 

in recent years have had the unintended consequence of making it more expensive for 

employers there to hire women into full-time jobs with opportunities for advancement, as 

women are more likely to be eligible for and to make use of such benefits.46 

This possibility should inform our own thinking about policies to make it easier 

for women and men to combine their family and career aspirations.  For instance, 

improving access to affordable and good quality childcare would appear to fit the bill, as 

it has been shown to support full-time employment.47  Recently, there also seems to be 

some momentum for providing families with paid leave at the time of childbirth.  The 

experience in Europe suggests picking policies that do not narrowly target childbirth, but 

instead can be used to meet a variety of the health and caregiving responsibilities.48  

                                                 
44 Note that Blau and Kahn  (2013) do not find that improvement in the provision of childcare in other 
advanced economies relative to the United States explain the divergence in participation since the 1990s; 
however, Thévenon (2013) finds that the greater provision of childcare has a positive effect on full-time 
employment.

Conclusion 

The United States faces a number of longer-term economic challenges, including 

the aging of the population and the low growth rate of productivity.  One recent study 

estimates that increasing the female participation rate to that of men would raise our gross 

domestic product by 5 percent.49  And, as I have argued, our workplaces and families, as 

well as women themselves, would benefit from continued progress.  However, a number 

of factors, which I have only had a chance to touch upon, appear to be holding women 

back, including the difficulty women currently have in trying to combine their careers 

with other aspects of their lives, including caregiving.  In looking to solutions, we should 

consider improvements to work environments and policies that benefit not only women, 

but all workers.  Pursuing such a strategy would be in keeping with the story of the rise in 

women’s involvement in the workforce, which, as I have described here, has contributed 

not only to their own well-being but more broadly to the welfare and prosperity of our 

country.   

The title for my remarks today, “So We All Can Succeed,” was inspired by 

Malala Yousafzai, the advocate for girls’ and women’s education, who said, “We cannot 

all succeed when half of us are held back.”50  Brown University has played its own role 

by admitting women 125 years ago, by educating many thousands of women over the 

                                                 
term disability program in 2000 showed that pregnancy and childbirth constituted just 15 percent of all 
claims (Lovell, 2008).

make our nation and the world a better place.
