It is an honor to speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s 20th Financial 

Markets Conference, and I am grateful to President Lockhart and the organizers for 

inviting me to do so.1  This evening I would like to take stock of progress on financial 

reforms in the nonbank financial sector and highlight some principles for approaching 

prudential regulation of this sector to further strengthen financial stability.   

The nonbank sector includes firms with diverse business models and practices, 

many of which differ greatly from those of banks.  Even so, nonbank firms and activities 

can pose the same key vulnerabilities as banks, including high leverage, excessive 

maturity transformation, and complexity, all of which can lead to financial instability.  

The reforms undertaken to date reflect both the differences and similarities between the 

nonbank and bank sectors.   

While there has been progress on the financial reform front, we should not be 

complacent about the stability of the financial system.  Regulation often creates 

incentives for activity to move outside the regulatory perimeter, and market participants 

respond to incentives.  Thus we should expect that further reforms will certainly be 

needed down the road.   

The Nonbank Sector Was an Important Source of Vulnerability in the Crisis 

As you know, the nonbank financial sector in the United States is larger, and 

plays a more important role, than it does in most other countries.  In recent years, about 

two-thirds of nonfinancial credit market debt has been held by nonbanks, which includes 

market-based funding by securitization vehicles and mutual funds as well as by 

institutions such as insurance companies and finance companies.  Nonbanks are involved

Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.

in many activities within the financial system as well, such as securities lending.  The 

nonbank sector has produced material benefits:  increased market liquidity, greater 

diversity of funding sources, and--it is often claimed--a more efficient allocation of risk 

to investors.  However, threats to the stability of the overall financial system have also 

increased, as was evident in the recent financial crisis. 

It is now eight years since major cracks in the financial system that led to the 

Global Financial Crisis first appeared in nonbank entities and activities.  While the causes 

of the crisis were complex, I will start by telling part of the tale of how nonbank distress 

was transmitted to the broader financial system.  The story begins with nonbank 

mortgage companies, which were important originators of subprime and prime mortgage 

loans, typically securitizing them or selling them to investment banks to be securitized.  

Rumors of troubles among these firms were circulating in 2006 as house prices started to 

decline, and a large firm filed for bankruptcy in December 2006.2  Then New Century, at 

one point the second largest subprime lender, filed for bankruptcy in April 2007 because 

its funding had disappeared as a result of fears about losses.  Many more followed in 

2007 and 2008.  Replacement of nonbank lenders’ capacity to process mortgage 

applications and to fund mortgage loans occurred only partially and slowly.   

Next step:  The distress in mortgage markets was amplified in the broader 

financial system in several ways, including something similar to a bank run but which 

instead occurred on asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) vehicles.  These vehicles 

invested in private-label mortgage securitizations and other long-term debt securities but 

were funded with short-term commercial paper.  Buyers of the commercial paper issued

bankruptcy on December 28, 2006.  Virtually all such firms have since either failed or been acquired.

by the ABCP vehicles withdrew funding starting in the late summer of 2007.  The 

volume of assets in the vehicles was large, about $700 billion, and after the run, the 

ability of the financial system to fund credit through many types of asset-backed 

securities became constrained.3  The runs on ABCP also put considerable pressure on the 

banking system because of the liquidity backstops that banks had provided to the 

vehicles.4   

Some of the guarantors also insured mortgage-backed securities, and when doubts 

arose about the ability of the guarantors to pay claims on mortgage-backed securities, the 

credibility of their guarantees of municipal securities was also reduced.  Municipalities 

then found it more difficult and costly to issue debt even though their activities were 

otherwise unrelated to subprime mortgages.5   

Next, the crisis spread to nonbank finance companies, which made a substantial 

fraction of consumer loans in the United States--for example, auto and credit card loans.  

As the crisis went on, the ability of such lenders to fund themselves through 

securitizations and commercial paper became increasingly constrained.  For a period after 

the failure of Lehman Brothers, many investors were unwilling to buy commercial paper 

and asset-backed securities at any price, and, as a result, finance companies faced tight 

3 See Daniel Covitz, Nellie Liang, and Gustavo Suarez (2013), “The Evolution of a Financial Crisis:  
Collapse of the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Market,” Journal of Finance, vol. 68 (June), pp. 815-48. 
4 Runs on the repurchase agreement (repo) funding of asset-backed securities were also troublesome for 
both banks and nonbanks.  See Gary Gorton and Andrew Metrick (2012), “Securitized Banking and the 
Run on Repo,” Journal of Financial Economics, vol. 104 (June), pp. 425-51. 
5 Moreover, state and municipal borrowers had been issuing long-term debt while paying short-term 
interest rates by using structures such as variable-rate demand notes (VRDNs), which gave holders the right 
to put the securities back to liquidity providers on short notice.  When the money market fund investors that 
held VRDNs became worried about their ability to get their money out at short notice, the volume of 
putbacks rose, and these developments ultimately led to increased payment obligations for some 
municipalities.

funding constraints.  In turn, the finance companies cut credit availability, which sharply 

depressed purchases of consumer durables, including automobiles.  

These examples highlight five lessons.  One is that the recent crisis first 

manifested itself in the nonbank sector and was worse for the nonbank sector than for 

banks.  Almost all the examples of financial distress mentioned so far occurred before 

stress in the commercial banking system became acute, and in most cases well before.  

For example, only three commercial banks failed in the United States in 2007, and 

commercial bank distress did not peak until the end of 2008 and later.   

A second lesson is that nonbank distress can harm the real economy.  Mortgages, 

auto loans, and credit through securities issuance became harder to obtain.  Some of the 

slack was taken up by commercial banks, but credit contracted sharply, and millions of 

Americans suffered.   

Third lesson:  Many of the problems at nonbanks were similar to the problems 

that plagued banks.  These problems included insolvency, illiquidity (by which I mean 

the loss of access to funding even if the nonbank was solvent), and a general loss of 

confidence, in which counterparties of all kinds became reluctant to deal with some 

nonbanks.   

Fourth lesson:  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) can handle a 

bank insolvency by keeping the bank’s functions running while it pays off depositors and 

finds buyers for the bank’s assets.  The Federal Reserve, as a central bank, can address 

bank illiquidity using its lender-of-last-resort authority.  Bank supervisory agencies can 

address a loss of confidence by actions such as the stress tests conducted in the spring of 

2009.  However the lack of such powers for nonbanks made it much more difficult for the 


 - 5 - 

authorities to address the distress of nonbanks and its influence on the financial system.  

Before the crisis, the authorities had few policy levers to provide liquidity or to resolve 

failures of nonbanks in a way that would avoid serious spillovers.  Liquidity was 

ultimately provided to some nonbank markets, such as the markets for securities backed 

by consumer and business assets, but the facilities were far from simple and took 

substantial time to create and implement.6   

Finally, nonbank distress can transmit to the banking sector through many 

channels, such as counterparty relationships, disruptions in funding markets, and knock-

on effects of asset fire sales.  The failure of Lehman provides a good example.  It was a 

nonbank, and its failure both imposed direct losses on its many types of counterparties 

and disrupted many markets with negative effects on banks.  

Principles for Prudential Regulation of Nonbank Intermediaries and Activities 

It is widely understood that any regulation of nonbanks should fit their activities 

and the vulnerabilities they pose, which implies that not every nonbank financial 

institution or activity necessarily needs to be regulated.  The two key principles for 

prudential regulation of nonbanks when it is warranted, are simple:  First, we should be 

attentive to solvency and liquidity; second, we should recognize that the financial system 

will change over time, and thus close monitoring and analysis of the system are essential.   

Insolvency and illiquidity are classic financial stability concerns.  And as 

mentioned, they were common themes of the distress at nonbanks that we observed

Greenwood, Samuel Hanson, and Jeremy Stein (2014), “A Comparative-Advantage Approach to 
Government Debt Maturity,” Journal of Finance, vol. 65, pp. 993–1028.

during the crisis.  Thus, we will not go far wrong if we begin by considering how to 

promote solvency and liquidity, taking into account the unique structures and activities of 

each type of nonbank. 

Liquidity challenges vary across nonbank firms and activities.  In some, the issue 

is whether a firm can fund itself in a distressed situation.  For example, a broker-dealer 

that relies heavily on short-term wholesale funding may find its funding evaporating at 

the first sign of trouble--a situation that could force the sale of assets at fire sale prices.  

One way to mitigate such problems is by having direct restrictions on the structure of 

liabilities, such as on their duration or on the use of wholesale funding.  Analogously 

with banks, one could also imagine requiring some nonbanks to maintain buffers of 

highly liquid assets that are sized according to the risk that their liabilities will run off 

quickly in a stress situation.   

In other nonbanks, withdrawable liabilities are part of the structure of the entity or 

activity, and what varies is the degree of mismatch between the liquidity of assets and 

liabilities.  For example, some open-ended mutual funds offer daily withdrawal privileges 

but invest in assets that take longer to sell and settle, giving investors an incentive to 

withdraw quickly when distress arises.  The fire sales of assets that may result can 

depress asset prices and increase volatility, with knock-on effects on other institutions 

and markets.  Concerns have grown about this liquidity mismatch as the aggregate value 

of less liquid assets in such funds has grown.  In part because of this concern, in a 

December Federal Register notice last year, the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

(FSOC) requested public comment on potential systemic risks posed by asset manager 

activities and products.

To promote solvency, one could impose ratio-type capital requirements, such as 

leverage ratio requirements or risk-based requirements.  An alternative is to require that 

firms perform regular stress tests to demonstrate that they can remain solvent and 

continue to lend even under stress.  In the Fed’s case, it has chosen to impose all of these 

requirements on banks, but these requirements cannot simply be applied, as is, to 

nonbanks.   

It is well known that solvency and liquidity can be difficult to separate during 

stress periods because fears about solvency, even if unfounded, can prompt a run.  Thus, 

one could also imagine promoting both solvency and liquidity at some nonbanks by 

imposing restrictions on their structure or activities in ways that reduce the likelihood of 

runs.  An example of this is recent changes by the Securities and Exchange Commission 

(SEC) in regulations for prime money market mutual funds.  Starting in 2016, prime 

institutional money funds will be required to publish a floating net asset value rather than 

a stable value of $1 per unit.  Stable-value funds, as we saw during the crisis, can be 

vulnerable to an unexpected “break the buck” event that leads to a run.  Under the new 

rules, funds can also impose limitations on withdrawals of liabilities and can impose 

liability redemption fees.  The SEC considered requiring money market funds to hold 

some capital but chose not to do so.  Only time will tell whether the adopted reforms have 

the intended run-damping effects, but if they do, capital will be much less necessary. 

Some may raise concerns that increased regulation of nonbanks will only increase 

moral hazard and increase risk to the system on net.  But moral hazard may already be 

present.  Over the past 20 years and more, governments have sometimes acted to contain 

damage from distress at nonbanks because of the economic damage that might have 


 - 8 - 

resulted from a failure to act.  We should always be mindful of moral hazard incentives 

and seek to contain them, but well-designed regulation might reduce rather than increase 

moral hazard.  In the banking sector, bank regulators have focused on improving 

resolution planning at banks and enhancing the ability of the FDIC to manage the 

resolution of a systemically important firm in a way that mitigates spillovers to the 

economy.  For example, proposals are now under consideration to require the largest and 

most interconnected banks to maintain a buffer of debt that could be converted to equity 

or that could otherwise absorb losses upon failure.  Such proposals could be viewed as a 

form of solvency regulation and this form of loss-absorbing capital might be appropriate 

for some of the largest and most interconnected nonbanks as well.   

In addition, nonbank intermediation often involves complex chains of activity 

encompassing many entities and markets.  Such chains tend to increase the web of 

interconnections in the financial system that, in some circumstances, can increase the 

likelihood or severity of systemic stress.  For example, movements in collateral values 

can trigger margin calls and fire sales of assets, and thus activities that depend on market-

valued collateral can be vulnerable.  The Financial Stability Board is currently 

considering reforms for margins on securities financing transactions.  Other 

interconnections involve exposures to counterparty default.  The new regulatory regime 

for derivatives, which I will discuss in a moment, seeks to mitigate counterparty risk. 

It is often said that stronger regulation of the banking sector will cause activity to 

move outside the perimeter of regulation.  This evolution also could lead to greater 

complexity, such as longer chains of interconnections, which makes it more difficult for 

market participants to understand the risks arising from their exposures.  Examples of 


 - 9 - 

migration that have already occurred include the movement of many loans made to large 

corporations from banks to collateralized loan obligations, the securitization of many 

credit card receivables, and the securitization of mortgages.  This kind of migration 

makes close monitoring by regulators particularly important.  Authorities should monitor 

for changes that may arise in response to the new regulations or to changing economic 

and financial conditions.  They will need information to do so, but for many nonbank 

entities, the flow of information is currently nonexistent or very limited and informal.   

Another force for evolution in the nonbank sector is the demand for safe money-

like assets.  Some argue that this demand for private money creation prompted the growth 

in “shadow banking” prior to the crisis.7  Indeed, whenever shortages develop, we might 

expect the nonbank financial system to create assets that appear safe but that could in 

certain circumstances pose systemic risks. 

Progress to Date 

We have seen some progress in improving the regulation of the nonbank financial 

sector.  Let me mention four areas of reform.  The first is the Dodd-Frank Act’s creation 

of the FSOC and the power it was given to designate individual nonbank firms as 

systemically important and thus subject to prudential regulation by the Federal Reserve.  

The FSOC has designated four nonbank firms as systemically important.8  The FSOC is 

also a useful venue for regulators to collaborate on identifying emerging threats.  And it

Stein, and Robert W. Vishny (forthcoming), “Banks and Patient Fixed-Income Investors,” Journal of

is an important mechanism through which agencies can cooperate in responding to 

practices or firms that migrate outside of traditional regulatory perimeters.   

Second:  securitization reform.  A regulation that is now in the process of 

implementation requires securitizers to retain some of the risk of the securities that they 

create.  That should incentivize them to structure securitizations in ways that better 

protect the holders of senior tranches from credit risk, although qualifying residential 

mortgages are exempt from the requirement.   

A third area is derivative reforms.  To reduce complexity and pro-cyclicality, 

these reforms include moving standardized derivatives to central counterparties (CCPs) 

and requiring initial and variation margin for noncleared derivatives.  Relatedly, as CCPs 

have gained prominence, regulators have become more focused on and concerned with 

their resilience, recovery, and resolution.  In addition, regulators are working to improve 

the quality and standardization of data reported to swap data repositories, and are actively 

participating in international efforts to develop uniform identification standards to 

facilitate the aggregation of such data.9  A key issue is to understand how and to what 

extent market participants who use derivatives are exposed to each other. 

Besides the new money market mutual fund rules that I have already mentioned, a 

fourth example is additional data collection on specific holdings of money funds, which 

has enhanced stability by providing investors with more information to better evaluate 

risks.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act mandated the establishment of the Office of 

Financial Research in order to help promote financial stability through the measurement 

9 Due to the critical nature of overseas derivatives data and the need to standardize these data for regulatory 
analysis, the CFTC and the OFR in 2014 formed a partnership to standardize and enhance the quality of the 
data collected by CFTC-registered swap data repositories.  Important work on standardizing derivatives 
data is also under way at the international level.

and analysis of risks, the conduct of essential research, and the collection and 

standardization of financial data.  Data collection has begun for hedge funds and progress 

is being made in collecting data on repurchase agreements and securities lending.  

Nevertheless, some nonbank firms and activities – including concerning the volume and 

uses of derivatives – are still opaque.   


To sum up, much has been done to strengthen prudential regulation and 

supervision of the nonbank financial system, but more will need to be done.  We must 

remain vigilant for changes in the system that increase systemic risk, and we should make 

appropriate changes to regulation and the structure of regulation as necessary.  Recent 

regulatory changes, including a macroprudential approach on the part of U.S. regulators, 

should help us to do that.10  But we should never forget the International Monetary 

Fund’s all-purpose warning whenever it has been tempted to give an economy a clean bill 

of health:  Complacency must be avoided. 





10 This change is reflected in the setting up of the LISCC – the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating 
Committee.
