Monetary Policy and the Housing Bubble

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association 

Atlanta, Georgia 


 
January 3, 2010 




 The financial crisis that began in August 2007 has been the most severe of the 

post-World War II era and, very possibly--once one takes into account the global scope 

of the crisis, its broad effects on a range of markets and institutions, and the number of 

systemically critical financial institutions that failed or came close to failure--the worst in 

modern history.  Although forceful responses by policymakers around the world avoided 

an utter collapse of the global financial system in the fall of 2008, the crisis was 

nevertheless sufficiently intense to spark a deep global recession from which we are only 

now beginning to recover. 

 Even as we continue working to stabilize our financial system and reinvigorate 

our economy, it is essential that we learn the lessons of the crisis so that we can prevent it 

from happening again.  Because the crisis was so complex, its lessons are many, and they 

are not always straightforward.  Surely, both the private sector and financial regulators 

must improve their ability to monitor and control risk-taking.  The crisis revealed not 

only weaknesses in regulators’ oversight of financial institutions, but also, more 

fundamentally, important gaps in the architecture of financial regulation around the 

world.  For our part, the Federal Reserve has been working hard to identify problems and 

to improve and strengthen our supervisory policies and practices, and we have advocated 

substantial legislative and regulatory reforms to address problems exposed by the crisis. 

 As with regulatory policy, we must discern the lessons of the crisis for monetary 

policy.  However, the nature of those lessons is controversial.  Some observers have 

assigned monetary policy a central role in the crisis.  Specifically, they claim that 

excessively easy monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in the first half of the decade 

helped cause a bubble in house prices in the United States, a bubble whose inevitable

collapse proved a major source of the financial and economic stresses of the past two 

years.  Proponents of this view typically argue for a substantially greater role for 

monetary policy in preventing and controlling bubbles in the prices of housing and other 

assets.  In contrast, others have taken the position that policy was appropriate for the 

macroeconomic conditions that prevailed, and that it was neither a principal cause of the 

housing bubble nor the right tool for controlling the increase in house prices.  Obviously, 

in light of the economic damage inflicted by the collapses of two asset price bubbles over 

the past decade, a great deal more than historical accuracy rides on the resolution of this 

debate. 

 The goal of my remarks today is to shed some light on these questions.  I will first 

review U.S. monetary policy in the aftermath of the 2001 recession and assess whether 

the policy was appropriate, given the state of the economy at that time and the 

information that was available to policymakers.  I will then discuss some evidence on the 

sources of the U.S. housing bubble, including the role of monetary policy.  Finally, I will 

draw some lessons for future monetary and regulatory policies.1 

U.S. Monetary Policy, 2002-2006 

 I will begin with a brief review of U.S. monetary policy during the past decade, 

focusing on the period from 2002 to 2006.  As you know, the U.S. economy suffered a 

moderate recession between March and November 2001, largely traceable to the ending 

of the dot-com boom and the resulting sharp decline in stock prices.  Geopolitical 

uncertainties associated with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the invasion

conclusions I draw in these remarks.

of Iraq in March 2003, as well as a series of corporate scandals in 2002, further clouded 

the economic situation in the early part of the decade. 

 Slide 1 shows the path, from the year 2000 to the present, of one key indicator of 

monetary policy, the target for the overnight federal funds rate set by the Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC).  The Federal Reserve manages the federal funds rate, the 

interest rate at which banks lend to each other, to influence broader financial conditions 

and thus the course of the economy.  As you can see, the target federal funds rate was 

lowered quickly in response to the 2001 recession, from 6.5 percent in late 2000 to 

1.75 percent in December 2001 and to 1 percent in June 2003.  After reaching the then-

record low of 1 percent, the target rate remained at that level for a year.  In June 2004, the 

FOMC began to raise the target rate, reaching 5.25 percent in June 2006 before pausing.  

(More recently, as you know, and as the rightward portion of the slide indicates, rates 

have been cut sharply once again.)  The low policy rates during the 2002-06 period were 

accompanied at various times by “forward guidance” on policy from the Committee.  For 

example, beginning in August 2003, the FOMC noted in four post-meeting statements 

that policy was likely to remain accommodative for a “considerable period.”2 

The aggressive monetary policy response in 2002 and 2003 was motivated by two 

principal factors.  First, although the recession technically ended in late 2001, the 

recovery remained quite weak and “jobless” into the latter part of 2003.  Real gross 

domestic product (GDP), which normally grows above trend in the early stages of an 

economic expansion, rose at an average pace just above 2 percent in 2002 and the first 

                                                       
2 In January 2004, the Committee expressed an intention to be “patient” regarding the removal of monetary 
policy accommodation.  In May 2004, a month before the Committee began to increase its target for the 
federal funds rate, it said that accommodation was likely to be removed at a pace that would be 
“measured.”  For discussions of the potential benefits of such communication, particularly in the face of 
possible deflationary risks, see Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) and Woodford (2007).

half of 2003, a rate insufficient to halt continued increases in the unemployment rate, 

which peaked above 6 percent in the first half of 2003.3  Second, the FOMC’s policy 

response also reflected concerns about a possible unwelcome decline in inflation.  Taking 

note of the painful experience of Japan, policymakers worried that the United States 

might sink into deflation and that, as one consequence, the FOMC’s target interest rate 

might hit its zero lower bound, limiting the scope for further monetary accommodation.  

FOMC decisions during this period were informed by a strong consensus among 

researchers that, when faced with the risk of hitting the zero lower bound, policymakers 

should lower rates preemptively, thereby reducing the probability of ultimately being 

constrained by the lower bound on the policy interest rate.4 

Evaluating the Tightness or Ease of Monetary Policy 

Although macroeconomic conditions certainly warranted accommodative policies 

in 2002 and subsequent years, the question remains whether policy was nevertheless 

easier than necessary.  Since we cannot know how the economy would have evolved 

under alternative monetary policies, any answer to this question must be conjectural. 

One approach used by many who have addressed this question is to compare 

Federal Reserve policies during this period to the recommendations derived from simple 

policy rules, such as the so-called Taylor rule, developed by John Taylor of Stanford 

University (Taylor, 1993).  This approach is subject to a number of limitations, which are 

                                                       
3 Many saw the relatively weak recovery as reflecting a “capital overhang” left over from the rapid pace of 
investment in information technology during the boom.  According to this view, the capital overhang both 
inhibited new capital investment and, by leading to ongoing productivity improvements, also limited the 
need for employers to add workers to meet the relatively moderate increases in final demand that were 
forthcoming.  As noted in the text, geopolitical uncertainties as well as corporate scandals added to the 
uncertainties faced by employers.

Madigan (1997), Reifschneider and Williams (2000), and Ahearne and others (2002).

important to keep in mind.5  Notably, simple policy rules like the Taylor rule are only 

rules of thumb, and reasonable people can disagree about important details of the 

construction of such rules.  Moreover, simple rules necessarily leave out many factors 

that may be relevant to the making of effective policy in a given episode--such as the risk 

of the policy rate hitting the zero lower bound, for example--which is why we do not 

make monetary policy on the basis of such rules alone.  For these reasons, even strong 

proponents of simple policy rules generally advise that they be used only as guidelines, 

not as substitutes for more complete policy analyses; and that, to ensure robustness, the 

recommendations of a number of alternative simple rules should be considered (Taylor, 

1999a).  That said, as much of the debate about monetary policy after the 2001 recession 

has made use of such rules, I will discuss them here as well. 

The well-known Taylor rule relates the prescribed setting of the overnight federal 

funds rate--the interest rate targeted by the FOMC in its making of monetary policy--to 

two factors:  (1) the deviation, in percentage points, of the current inflation rate from 

policymakers’ longer-term inflation objective; and (2) the so-called output gap, defined 

as the percentage difference between current output (usually defined as real GDP) and the 

“normal” or “potential” level of output.  In symbols, the standard form of the Taylor rule 

is given by the equation shown in Slide 2.  In this equation,  is the prescribed value of 

the policy interest rate in a given period t;  is the deviation of the actual inflation 

rate π from its target  in period t; and , the “output gap,” is the deviation of 

actual real output y from potential output  in period t.  The parameters a and b are 

                                                       
5 Kohn (2007) discusses some of these limitations and anticipates some of the points made in my remarks 
today.

positive numbers that describe how strongly the policy rate should respond to deviations 

of inflation from its target and of output from its potential. 

As we would expect, the Taylor rule tells policymakers that interest rates should 

be higher when inflation is above target, ( 0 , or when output is above its 

potential, 0.  Taylor (1993) estimated the long-run real value of the federal 

funds rate to be about 2 percent.  The equation for the Taylor rule accordingly shows that 

when inflation and output are equal to their targets, the federal funds rate--which is 

expressed here in nominal terms--should equal 2 plus the rate of inflation.  Equivalently, 

when inflation and output equal their targets, the real value of the federal funds rate 

should equal 2 percent. 

 To make the Taylor rule equation shown in Slide 2 operational, one needs to 

specify numerical values for the coefficients a and b, choose appropriate indicators of 

inflation and output, and specify a target rate for inflation and a measure of potential 

output.  In his 1993 paper introducing his eponymous rule, Taylor suggested setting both 

a and b equal to 0.5.  So, for example, according to the original Taylor rule, if output 

rises 1 percent relative to its potential, then, all else equal, the Federal Reserve should 

raise its policy rate by 0.5 percent, or 50 basis points.  Following Taylor’s suggestions for 

parameter values, in Slide 3 we show by the dashed red line the values of the federal 

funds rate implied by the Taylor rule for the period from 2000 to the present, with 

inflation measured by the consumer price index (CPI), the Fed’s assumed inflation target 

set to 2 percent, output measured by real GDP, and the output gap as estimated 

retrospectively by the Federal Reserve’s primary forecasting model, the FRB/US model.  


- 7 - 
 

The Taylor rule prescription is juxtaposed with the actual path of the policy rate taken 

from Slide 1, again shown in blue. 

The comparison displayed in Slide 3 provides the most commonly cited evidence 

that monetary policy was too easy during the period from 2002 to 2006, as the actual 

federal funds rate is below the values implied by the Taylor rule--by about 200 basis 

points on average over this five-year period (Taylor, 2007). 

Of course, the validity of that conclusion depends on whether the specific 

assumptions and measurements used to construct the Taylor rule’s policy prescription are 

appropriate.  Room for disagreement exists.  For example, some empirical and simulation 

evidence suggests that the responsiveness of policy to the output gap, given by the 

parameter b in the Taylor rule equation, should be higher than the value of 0.5 originally 

chosen by Taylor.6  Higher values of b lead the Taylor rule to recommend somewhat 

lower policy rates during recessions and their aftermaths. 

 The prescriptions of the Taylor rule may also depend sensitively on how inflation 

and the output gap are measured.  The difficulties in measuring the output gap, 

particularly in real time, are well known.  The choice of inflation measure may also be 

consequential.  In his original 1993 paper, Taylor chose to measure inflation using the 

GDP deflator.  As noted, the Taylor rule policy prescription shown in Slide 3 is based on 

the familiar CPI measure of inflation.  For its part, during the past decade, the FOMC has 

typically focused on inflation as measured by the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE), because that measure is less dominated than is the CPI by the 

imputed rent of owner-occupied housing, and for other technical reasons.  As it happens, 

                                                       
6 Taylor (1999b) contains a set of studies comparing economic performance in a range of economic models 
under alternative rules and parameter settings.

the choice of inflation measure matters for the interpretation of this episode, as alternative 

measures gave policymakers somewhat different signals.  Notably, core PCE inflation for 

2003 was initially reported, in the first quarter of 2004, as having slowed to about 

1 percent, and it appeared to be on a steep downward trajectory.7  These data heightened 

concerns about deflation on the FOMC.  In contrast, the CPI data released at the same 

time showed core inflation for 2003 of about 2 percent.  In this case, data revisions 

ultimately raised estimates of PCE inflation for that period, implying that deflation was 

less of a risk than was thought at the time.  But that such revisions would occur could not 

be known in advance, and policy decisions, of course, must be made based on the 

information available at the time. 

 For my purposes today, however, the most significant concern regarding the use 

of the standard Taylor rule as a policy benchmark is its implication that monetary policy 

should depend on currently observed values of inflation and output.  In particular, the 

Taylor rule recommendation shown in Slide 3 relates the prescribed policy interest rate to 

the inflation rate and output gap that correspond to the same quarter in which the policy 

decision was made.8  However, because monetary policy works with a lag, effective 

monetary policy must take into account the forecast values of the goal variables, rather 

than the current values.  Indeed, in that spirit, the FOMC issues regular economic 

projections, and these projections have been shown to have an important influence on 

policy decisions (Orphanides and Wieland, 2008). 

                                                       
7 Inflation measures are on a four-quarter basis.  Core inflation excludes the prices of food and energy.  
Because it excludes the most volatile components of the price index, core inflation was often used by the 
FOMC as an indicator of the underlying trend of inflation. 
8 More precisely, because inflation is measured on a four-quarter basis, the current inflation rate 
corresponds to the rate of price increase over the current quarter and the prior three quarters. 


- 9 - 
 

The distinction between current and forecast values does not always matter much, 

as (for example) high levels of inflation or output today may signal high levels of those 

variables in the future.  However, over the past decade, the distinction between current 

and forecast inflation has been an important one.  On several occasions during this 

period, surges in energy prices led to increases in overall inflation.  According to the 

standard Taylor rule, whose policy prescription depends on the current value of inflation, 

these episodes should have led to a significant tightening of monetary policy.  However, 

both the FOMC and private forecasters expected these increases in energy prices to 

subside--correctly, as it turned out--and therefore did not much adjust their medium-term 

forecasts for inflation.  Consequently, policy was not tightened as much as would have 

been called for by the standard Taylor rule.  Put another way, the standard Taylor rule 

makes no distinction between increases in inflation expected to be temporary and those 

expected to be longer lasting.  In practice, however, policymakers have responded less to 

increases in inflation that they expect to be temporary, a reasonable strategy given that 

monetary policy affects inflation only with a significant lag. 

Slide 4 shows the quantitative implications of this point.  The actual paths of the 

policy rate, in blue, and the policy prescription implied by the standard Taylor rule, the 

dashed red line, are the same as in Slide 3.  Also shown, as a dotted green line, is the 

monetary policy path prescribed by an alternative version of the Taylor rule that replaces 

the current rate of inflation on the right-hand side with a forecast of inflation over the 

current and subsequent three quarters.  Forecasts are those that were actually made in real 

time, that is, at the time at which the corresponding policy rate was chosen.  For the 

period through 2004, these forecasts are the staff forecasts (the so-called Greenbook 


- 10 - 
 

forecasts) that were prepared for each policy meeting.  Because Greenbook forecasts for 

the period after 2004 are not yet publicly available, from 2005 on the forecasts are 

constructed from the publicly released, contemporaneous projections of FOMC 

participants, using methods developed by Athanasios Orphanides and Volker Wieland 

(2008).9  In addition, consistent with the practices of the FOMC, inflation is measured by 

the PCE price index as was available in real time, instead of by the CPI.10   

As Slide 4 shows, the alternative Taylor rule prescribes a path for policy that is 

much closer to that followed throughout the decade, including recent years.  In other 

words, when one takes into account that policymakers should and do respond differently 

to temporary and longer-lasting changes in inflation, monetary policy following the 2001 

recession appears to have been reasonably appropriate, at least in relation to a simple 

policy rule. 

Which version of the Taylor rule--the standard version, that uses current values of 

inflation, or the alternative version, that employs inflation forecasts--is the more reliable 

guide?  I have explained my preference for using inflation forecasts rather than actual 

inflation in the policy rule:  Monetary policy works with a lag, and therefore policy 

decisions must be forward looking.  One might still prefer the simplicity of the standard 

Taylor rule that uses current inflation values.  However, note from Slide 4 that a 

                                                       
9 FOMC projections between 2005 and 2007 are obtained from Monetary Policy Report to the Congress, 
published in February and July (available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/mpr_default.htm); 
projections for core inflation are converted to projections for headline inflation based on staff calculations 
that in turn rely on energy futures prices.  Starting in 2008, FOMC inflation forecasts, for both core and 
headline inflation, become available four times each year in the Summary of Economic Projections (see, for 
example, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2009), “Minutes of Federal Open Market 
Committee, January 9, 21, and 29-30, 2008,” press release, February 20, 
www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080220a.htm). 
10 In the same spirit, we also replace the output gap as measured retrospectively by the FRB/US model with 
the output gap from that model as measured in real time.  This change has no significant effect on the 
policy prescriptions over most of the period.

proponent of the standard rule would have recommended that the FOMC raise the policy 

rate to a range of 7 to 8 percent through the first three quarters of 2008, just after the 

recession peak and just before the intensification of the financial crisis in September and 

October--a policy decision that probably would not have garnered much support among 

monetary specialists.  In contrast, Slide 4 shows that the version of the Taylor rule based 

on forecast inflation (in green dots) explains both the course of monetary policy earlier in 

the past decade as well as the decision not to respond aggressively to what did in fact turn 

out to be a temporary surge in inflation in 2008.  This comparison suggests that the 

Taylor rule using forecast inflation is a more useful benchmark, both as a description of 

recent FOMC behavior and as a guide to appropriate policy. 

Although monetary policy from 2002 to 2006 appears to have been reasonably 

consistent with the Federal Reserve’s mandated goals of maximum sustainable 

employment and price stability, we have not yet addressed the possibility that 

accommodative policies--though perhaps appropriate for achieving medium-term 

inflation and output goals--inadvertently contributed to the housing bubble.  I turn now to 

that question. 

Monetary Policy and the Housing Bubble 

 To set the stage for the discussion, Slide 5 shows the annual increase in nominal 

house prices from 1978 to the present.11  After some years of slow growth, U.S. house 

                                                       
11 These data are based on repeat sales of specific homes, which helps to correct for changes in the 
composition of home sales, and include information on homes financed outside of the government-
sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 

An important, and perhaps underappreciated, issue is that measurement of house prices has 
improved considerably since the early part of the past decade.  The LoanPerformance index on which Slide 
5 is based corrects for changes in the composition of sales through the use of repeat sales, as noted in the 
text.  During the first half of the past decade, however, the only publicly available house price indexes 
making that important correction were based on data taken from mortgages purchased by the government-
sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  However, because they were based on homes 


- 12 - 
 

prices began to rise more rapidly in the late 1990s.  Prices grew at a 7 to 8 percent annual 

rate in 1998 and 1999, and in the 9 to 11 percent range from 2000 to 2003.  Thus, the 

beginning of the run-up in housing prices predates the period of highly accommodative 

monetary policy.  Shiller (2007) dates the beginning of the boom in 1998.  On the other 

hand, the most rapid price gains were in 2004 and 2005, when the annual rate of house 

price appreciation was between 15 and 17 percent.  Thus, the timing of the housing 

bubble does not rule out some contribution from monetary policy. 

To try to assess the importance of that possible contribution, in the remainder of 

my remarks I will consider briefly two related questions.  First, the cumulative increase in 

housing prices shown in Slide 5 is quite large.  Can accommodative monetary policies 

during this period reasonably account for the magnitude of the increase in house prices 

that we observed?  If not, what does account for it?  Second, house prices rose 

significantly during this period in many industrialized countries, not just in the United 

States.  If monetary policy was an important source of house price appreciation in the 

United States, it seems reasonable to expect that, in an international comparison, 

countries with easier monetary policies should have been more likely to have significant 

rises in house prices as well.  Is that the case?  

With respect to the magnitude of house-price increases:  Economists who have 

investigated the issue have generally found that, based on historical relationships, only a 

small portion of the increase in house prices earlier this decade can be attributed to the

financed with jumbo, alt-A, and subprime mortgages.  See Dokko and others (2009).

stance of U.S. monetary policy.12  This conclusion has been reached using both 

econometric models and purely statistical analyses that make no use of economic theory. 

To demonstrate this finding in a simple way, I will use a statistical model 

developed by Federal Reserve Board researchers that summarizes the historical 

relationships among key macroeconomic indicators, house prices, and monetary policy 

(Dokko and others, 2009).  The statistical technique employed in this model, known as 

vector autoregression, is familiar to econometricians who seek to analyze the joint 

evolution of a collection of data series over time.  The model incorporates seven 

variables, including measures of economic growth, inflation, unemployment, residential 

investment, house prices, and the federal funds rate, and it is estimated using data from 

1977 to 2002.13  For our purposes, the value of such a model is that it can be used to 

predict the behavior of any of the variables being studied, assuming that historical 

relationships hold and that the other variables in the system take on their actual historical 

values. 

Slide 6 illustrates the application of this procedure to the federal funds rate and 

housing prices over the period from 2003 to 2008.  In the left panel of the figure, the solid 

line shows the actual history of the federal funds rate.  The shaded area in the figure is 

constructed using the results of the statistical model; it shows the range of possible 

outcomes that would be considered “normal” for the federal funds rate, assuming that the 

other six variables included in the model took their actual values during the years 2003 

through 2008.  Values of the federal funds rate that fall in the shaded area are relatively 

                                                       
12 See, for example, Del Negro and Otrok (2007), Jarocinski and Smets (2008), Edge, Kiley, and Laforte 
(2009), and Iacoviello and Neri (forthcoming). 
13 See Dokko and others (2009) for details.  The authors stop the sample in 2002 to exclude the period in 
question. 


- 14 - 
 

“close to” (technically, within 2 standard deviations of) the corresponding forecast 

values.  In line with our earlier discussion, the left panel of the figure suggests that, 

although monetary policy during the period following the 2001 recession was 

accommodative, it was not inconsistent with the historical experience, given the 

macroeconomic environment of the time. 

The right panel of the figure shows the forecast behavior of house prices during 

the recent period, taking as given macroeconomic conditions and the actual path of the 

federal funds rate.  As you can see, the rise in house prices falls well outside the 

predictions of the model.  Thus, when historical relationships are taken into account, it is 

difficult to ascribe the house price bubble either to monetary policy or to the broader 

macroeconomic environment. 

A possible objection to this conclusion is that, because of changes in methods of 

housing finance, the responsiveness of house prices to monetary policy may have been 

different in the past decade than it was in the 1980s and 1990s.  For example, during 

2003 and 2004, about one-third of mortgage applications were for adjustable-rate 

mortgage (ARM) products.  Low policy rates feed through to monthly mortgage 

payments more directly when the mortgage interest rate is adjustable and tied to short-

term rates.  This linkage could rationalize a stronger effect of monetary policy on house 

prices in the more recent period (Iacoviello and Neri, forthcoming). 

Some evidence on this question is provided in Slide 7, which shows illustrative 

initial monthly mortgage payments for a median-priced house for different types of 

mortgages.14  The interest rates used in calculating these payments are actual averages for 

prime borrowers for the period from 2003 to 2006, as provided by Freddie Mac.  A 
                                                       
14 Calculations are for a house price of $225,000 and a 20 percent down payment. 


- 15 - 
 

comparison of the initial monthly payment for a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage and an 

ARM shows that the ARM payment is about 16 percent lower, a consequential but not 

dramatic difference.  The ARM payment is not substantially lower than the fixed-rate 

payment because it includes amortization of principal and a spread over the index interest 

rate.15  Moreover, less accommodative monetary policy would not have had a substantial 

effect on ARM payments.  Using the Board’s principal macroeconometric model, staff 

simulated the effects on the economy and on mortgage rates of a monetary policy that 

followed the original 1993 Taylor rule, taking into account the feedback effects from 

tighter policy to the economy.16  Under this scenario, they found that the initial ARM rate 

would have been about 0.71 percentage point higher than in the baseline and that the 

initial monthly payment for an ARM borrower would have increased by only about $75.  

This result does not suggest that moderately tighter monetary policy would have 

dissuaded many potential ARM borrowers. 

Slide 7 also shows initial monthly payments for some alternative types of 

variable-rate mortgages, including interest-only ARMs, long-amortization ARMs, 

negative amortization ARMs (in which the initial payment does not even cover interest 

costs), and pay-option ARMs (which give the borrower considerable flexibility regarding 

the size of monthly payments in the early stages of the contract).  These more exotic 

mortgages show much more significant reductions in the initial monthly payment than 

                                                       
15 The figures in Slide 7, which are for prime borrowers, also take no account of the fact that subprime 
borrowers using ARM products typically faced both higher interest rates and additional fees. 
16 The simulation covered the period from 2003 through 2005.  The year 2006 was excluded because actual 
policy and that prescribed by the 1993 Taylor rule were not significantly different in that year.  When the 
1993 Taylor rule is assumed to govern monetary policy, the simulated federal funds rate averages 2.6 
percent from 2003 to 2005, 70 basis points higher than in the baseline.  The increase in the federal funds 
rate is less than the difference shown in Slide 4 because of feedback effects working through the economy; 
a less accommodative policy rule reduces output and inflation, which in turn limits the increase in rates 
implied by the policy rule.

could be obtained through a standard ARM.  Clearly, for lenders and borrowers focused 

on minimizing the initial payment, the choice of mortgage type was far more important 

than the level of short-term interest rates. 

The availability of these alternative mortgage products proved to be quite 

important and, as many have recognized, is likely a key explanation of the housing 

bubble.  Slide 8 shows the percentage of variable-rate mortgages originated with various 

exotic features, beginning in 2000.  As you can see, the use of these nonstandard features 

increased rapidly from early in the decade through 2005 or 2006.  Because such features 

are presumably not appropriate for many borrowers, Slide 8 is evidence of a protracted 

deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards, which was further exacerbated by 

practices such as the use of no-documentation loans.  The picture that emerges is 

consistent with many accounts of the period:  At some point, both lenders and borrowers 

became convinced that house prices would only go up.  Borrowers chose, and were 

extended, mortgages that they could not be expected to service in the longer term.  They 

were provided these loans on the expectation that accumulating home equity would soon 

allow refinancing into more sustainable mortgages.  For a time, rising house prices 

became a self-fulfilling prophecy, but ultimately, further appreciation could not be 

sustained and house prices collapsed.  This description suggests that regulatory and 

supervisory policies, rather than monetary policies, would have been more effective 

means of addressing the run-up in house prices.  I will return to this point in my 

conclusion. 

Let me turn now to the international evidence on the link between monetary 

policy and house price appreciation.  Some cross-country evidence on this link is shown 


- 17 - 
 

in Slide 9.  The figure is drawn from a recent study of 20 industrial countries by the 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) (Fatás and others, 2009) and replicated by Board 

staff.  The vertical axis of the figure shows the change in real (inflation-adjusted) house 

prices in each country from the fourth quarter of 2001 until the third quarter of 2006, a 

period that spans the sharpest period of price appreciation in most countries.  Countries 

represented by diamonds that are further “north” in Slide 9 had relatively greater house 

price appreciation over this period.  You can see from the figure that house price 

appreciation in the United States, though of course large in absolute terms, was actually 

less than that in the majority of countries in the sample. 

The horizontal axis of the figure, following the IMF study, shows the degree of 

monetary policy ease or tightness in each country, measured by the average deviation of 

policy in each country from the prescriptions of a standard version of the Taylor rule over 

the corresponding period.  Countries shown further to the left in the figure had more 

accommodative monetary policies over the period, relative to the predictions of the 

Taylor rule.  The United States is shown as having a relatively accommodative policy, as 

you can see; however, that conclusion is driven in part by the use of current rather than 

forecast inflation in the Taylor rule, the point I discussed earlier.  Interestingly, 

essentially all of these countries had monetary policies easier than that prescribed by the 

Taylor rule, as shown by the fact that every country is situated on or to the left of the 

vertical axis in the figure.17 

                                                       
17 Note that the figure ascribes different degrees of monetary ease to different countries within the euro 
area; although these countries share the common monetary policy of the European Central Bank, 
differences across countries in inflation and output gaps imply that the degree of policy accommodation 
relative to economic conditions in each country can differ.  In particular, holding constant the interest rate 
set by the European Central Bank, the Taylor rule will tend to impute easier monetary policies to countries 
with strong economies.  Of course, all else equal, a strong economy, even if its strength is unrelated to 
monetary policy, should experience more robust house prices.  Consequently, the relationship shown in 


- 18 - 
 

As Slide 9 shows, the relationship between the stance of monetary policy and 

house price appreciation across countries is quite weak.  For example, 11 of the 20 

countries in the sample had both tighter monetary policies, relative to the standard 

Taylor-rule prescriptions, and greater house price appreciation than the United States.  

The overall relationship between house prices and monetary policy, shown by the solid 

line, has the expected slope (tighter policy is associated with somewhat slower house 

price appreciation).  However, the relationship is statistically insignificant and 

economically weak; moreover, monetary policy differences explain only about 5 percent 

of the variability in house price appreciation across countries. 

What does explain the variability in house price appreciation across countries?  In 

previous remarks I have pointed out that capital inflows from emerging markets to 

industrial countries can help to explain asset price appreciation and low long-term real 

interest rates in the countries receiving the funds--the so-called global savings glut 

hypothesis (Bernanke, 2005, 2007).  Today is not the appropriate time to revisit that 

hypothesis in any detail, but I would like to take a moment to show that accounting for 

capital inflows is likely to prove fruitful for explaining cross-country differences.  Slide 

10, which is analogous to Slide 9, shows the relationship between capital inflows and 

house price appreciation for the same set of countries as in the previous slide.  Also as in 

the previous slide, house price appreciation is shown on the vertical axis of the figure.  

The horizontal axis shows the increase in the current account (equivalently, the increase 

in capital inflows) for each country, measured as a percentage of GDP.  The downward 

                                                                                                                                                                 
Slide 9 could potentially overstate the causal relationship between monetary policy and house price 
appreciation.  For the group of euro-zone countries included in Slide 9, the slope of the relationship 
between house prices and monetary policy accommodation is economically more consequential but not 
statistically significant (t = -1.55, R2 = 0.23). 


- 19 - 
 

slope of the relationship is as expected--countries in which current accounts worsened 

and capital inflows rose (shown in the left half of the figure) had greater house price 

appreciation over this period.18  However, in contrast to the previous slide, the 

relationship is highly significant, both statistically and economically, and about 

31 percent of the variability in house price appreciation across countries is explained.19  

This simple relationship requires more interpretation before any strong conclusions about 

causality can be drawn; in particular, we need to understand better why some countries 

drew stronger capital inflows than others.  I will only note here that, as more 

accommodative monetary policies generally reduce capital inflows, this relationship 

appears to be inconsistent with the existence of a strong link between monetary policy 

and house price appreciation. 

Conclusions and Policy Implications 

 My objective today has been to review the evidence on the link between monetary 

policy in the early part of the past decade and the rapid rise in house prices that occurred 

at roughly the same time.  The direct linkages, at least, are weak.  Because monetary 

policy works with a lag, policymakers’ response to changes in inflation and other 

economic variables should depend on whether those changes are expected to be 

temporary or longer-lasting.  When that point is taken into account, policy during that 

period--though certainly accommodative--does not appear to have been inappropriate, 

given the state of the economy and policymakers’ medium-term objectives.  House prices 

began to rise in the late 1990s, and although the most rapid price increases occurred when 

short-term interest rates were at their lowest levels, the magnitude of house price gains 

                                                       
18 Ahearne and others (2005) obtain similar results. 
19 The slope coefficient of -3.93 is statistically significant at the 1 percent level (t = -2.84, p = 0.0109).

seems too large to be readily explainable by the stance of monetary policy alone.  

Moreover, cross-country evidence shows no significant relationship between monetary 

policies and the pace of house price increases. 

 What policy implications should we draw?  I noted earlier that the most important 

source of lower initial monthly payments, which allowed more people to enter the 

housing market and bid for properties, was not the general level of short-term interest 

rates, but the increasing use of more exotic types of mortgages and the associated decline 

of underwriting standards.  That conclusion suggests that the best response to the housing 

bubble would have been regulatory, not monetary.  Stronger regulation and supervision 

aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders’ risk management would have 

been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a 

general increase in interest rates.  Moreover, regulators, supervisors, and the private 

sector could have more effectively addressed building risk concentrations and inadequate 

risk-management practices without necessarily having had to make a judgment about the 

sustainability of house price increases. 

The Federal Reserve and other agencies did make efforts to address poor 

mortgage underwriting practices.  In 2005, we worked with other banking regulators to 

develop guidance for banks on nontraditional mortgages, notably interest-only and 

option-ARM products.  In March 2007, we issued interagency guidance on subprime 

lending, which was finalized in June.  After a series of hearings that began in June 2006, 

we used authority granted us under the Truth in Lending Act to issue rules that apply to 

all high-cost mortgage lenders, not just banks.  However, these efforts came too late or 


- 21 - 
 

were insufficient to stop the decline in underwriting standards and effectively constrain 

the housing bubble. 

The lesson I take from this experience is not that financial regulation and 

supervision are ineffective for controlling emerging risks, but that their execution must be 

better and smarter.  The Federal Reserve is working not only to improve our ability to 

identify and correct problems in financial institutions, but also to move from an 

institution-by-institution supervisory approach to one that is attentive to the stability of 

the financial system as a whole.  Toward that end, we are supplementing reviews of 

individual firms with comparative evaluations across firms and with analyses of the 

interactions among firms and markets.  We have further strengthened our commitment to 

consumer protection.  And we have strongly advocated financial regulatory reforms, such 

as the creation of a systemic risk council, that will reorient the country’s overall 

regulatory structure toward a more systemic approach.  The crisis has shown us that 

indicators such as leverage and liquidity must be evaluated from a systemwide 

perspective as well as at the level of individual firms. 

Is there any role for monetary policy in addressing bubbles?  Economists have 

pointed out the practical problems with using monetary policy to pop asset price bubbles, 

and many of these were illustrated by the recent episode.  Although the house price 

bubble appears obvious in retrospect--all bubbles appear obvious in retrospect--in its 

earlier stages, economists differed considerably about whether the increase in house 

prices was sustainable; or, if it was a bubble, whether the bubble was national or confined 

to a few local markets.  Monetary policy is also a blunt tool, and interest rate increases in 

2003 or 2004 sufficient to constrain the bubble could have seriously weakened the 


- 22 - 
 

economy at just the time when the recovery from the previous recession was becoming 

established. 

That said, having experienced the damage that asset price bubbles can cause, we 

must be especially vigilant in ensuring that the recent experiences are not repeated.  All 

efforts should be made to strengthen our regulatory system to prevent a recurrence of the 

crisis, and to cushion the effects if another crisis occurs.  However, if adequate reforms 

are not made, or if they are made but prove insufficient to prevent dangerous buildups of 

financial risks, we must remain open to using monetary policy as a supplementary tool 

for addressing those risks--proceeding cautiously and always keeping in mind the 

inherent difficulties of that approach.  Clearly, we still have much to learn about how best 

to make monetary policy and to meet threats to financial stability in this new era.  

Maintaining flexibility and an open mind will be essential for successful policymaking as 

we feel our way forward.
