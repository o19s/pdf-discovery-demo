A Century of U.S. Central Banking:  Goals, Frameworks, Accountability 




Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at 


“The First 100 Years of the Federal Reserve:   

The Policy Record, Lessons Learned, and Prospects for the Future” 


A conference sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research 


Cambridge, Massachusetts 








July 10, 2013 





I’d like to thank the National Bureau of Economic Research for organizing this 

conference in recognition of the Federal Reserve’s centennial, and I’m glad to have the 

opportunity to participate.  In keeping with the spirit of the conference, my remarks today 

will take a historical perspective.  I will leave discussion of current policy to today’s 

question-and-answer session and, of course, to my congressional testimony next week. 

  Today, I’ll discuss the evolution over the past 100 years of three key aspects of 

Federal Reserve policymaking:  the goals of policy, the policy framework, and 

accountability and communication.  The changes over time in these three areas provide a 

useful perspective, I believe, on how the role and functioning of the Federal Reserve have 

changed since its founding in 1913, as well as some lessons for the present and for the 

future.  I will pay particular attention to several key episodes of the Fed’s history, all of 

which have been referred to in various contexts with the adjective “Great” attached to 

them:  the Great Experiment of the Federal Reserve’s founding, the Great Depression, the 

Great Inflation and subsequent disinflation, the Great Moderation, and the recent Great 

Recession. 

The Great Experiment 

In the words of one of the authors of the Federal Reserve Act, Robert Latham 

Owen, the Federal Reserve was established to “provide a means by which periodic panics 

which shake the American Republic and do it enormous injury shall be stopped.”
1
  In 

short, the original goal of the Great Experiment that was the founding of the Fed was the 

                                                 
1
 See Owen (1919, p. 24).  The Treasury carried out some central banking functions before the creation of 

the Federal Reserve.  In addition, the United States had experimented with central banking before, with the 

First and Second Banks of the United States.  By 1913, however, it had been about 75 years since the latter 

institution had ceased fulfilling that purpose.  Moreover, the Federal Reserve operated somewhat 

differently from the prior institutions, and, in that respect, its creation amounted to an experiment.

preservation of financial stability.
2
  At the time, the standard view of panics was that they 

were triggered when the needs of business and agriculture for liquid funds outstripped the 

available supply--as when seasonal plantings or shipments of crops had to be financed, 

for example--and that panics were further exacerbated by the incentives of banks and 

private individuals to hoard liquidity during such times.
3
  The new institution was 

intended to relieve such strains by providing an “elastic” currency--that is, by providing 

liquidity as needed to individual member banks through the discount window; 

commercial banks, in turn, would then be able to accommodate their customers.  

Interestingly, although congressional advocates hoped the creation of the Fed would help 

prevent future panics, they did not fully embrace the idea that the Fed should help end 

ongoing panics by serving as lender of last resort, as had been recommended by the 

British economist and writer Walter Bagehot.
4
  Legislators imposed limits on the Federal 

Reserve’s ability to lend in response to panics, for example, by denying nonmember 

banks access to the discount window and by restricting the types of collateral that the Fed 

could accept.
5
 

The framework that the Federal Reserve employed in its early years to promote 

financial stability reflected in large measure the influence of the so-called real bills 

                                                 
2
 Per a review of the 1929 book Wall Street and Washington in the New York Times, “The Federal Reserve 

System has from the first necessarily been a great experiment, bound to adjust its general policies to the 

requirements of such novel and varying situations as should arise in the course of our financial history and 

which could not possibly be foreseen” (Noyes, 1929).  
3
 Friedman and Schwartz (1963) describe the debate about the elastic currency.  Warburg (1914) discusses 

hoarding and the panic dynamics that the Federal Reserve was established to prevent. 
4
 See Willis (1923, p. 1407), Carlson and Wheelock (2012), and Bordo and Wheelock (2013).  Bagehot 

([1873] 1897) is the source of the classic dictum that a panic should be addressed by the central bank, by 

lending freely at a penalty rate. 
5
 The Monetary Control Act of 1980 gave all depository institutions access to the discount window.  The 

collateral acceptable to be pledged to the discount window has been expanded significantly over time; in 

particular, various pieces of banking legislation in the early 1930s enabled the Federal Reserve to make 

advances to member banks so long as the loans were “secured to the satisfaction” of the Federal Reserve 

Bank extending the loan.

doctrine, as well as the fact that the United States was on the gold standard.
6
  In the 

framework of the real bills doctrine, the Federal Reserve saw its function as meeting the 

needs of business for liquidity--consistent with the idea of providing an elastic currency--

with the ultimate goal of supporting financial and economic stability.
7
  When business 

activity was increasing, the Federal Reserve helped accommodate the need for credit by 

supplying liquidity to banks; when business was contracting and less credit was needed, 

the Fed reduced the liquidity in the system. 

As I mentioned, the Federal Reserve pursued this approach to policy in the 

context of the gold standard.  Federal Reserve notes were redeemable in gold on demand, 

and the Fed was required to maintain a gold reserve equal to 40 percent of outstanding 

notes.  However, contrary to the principles of an idealized gold standard, the Federal 

Reserve often took actions to prevent inflows and outflows of gold from being fully 

translated into changes in the domestic money supply.
8
  This practice, together with the 

size of the U.S. economy, gave the Federal Reserve considerable autonomy in monetary 

policy and, in particular, allowed the Fed to conduct policy according to the real bills 

doctrine without much hindrance. 

The policy framework of the Fed’s early years has been much criticized in 

retrospect.  Although the gold standard did not appear to have greatly constrained U.S. 

monetary policy in the years after the Fed’s founding, subsequent research has 

highlighted the extent to which the international gold standard served to destabilize the 

                                                 
6
 See Humphrey (1982) for a discussion of the historical evolution of the real bills doctrine. 

7
 This interpretation follows from the discussion in the Tenth Annual Report of the Federal Reserve Board 

(Board of Governors, 1924).  Soon after the Federal Reserve was founded, its mission shifted to supporting 

the war effort and then to managing the unwinding of that support.  The year 1923 was thus one of the first 

in which the Federal Reserve confronted normal peacetime financial conditions, and it took the opportunity 

to articulate its views on the appropriate conduct of policy in such conditions.

 The Federal Reserve could undo the effects of gold inflows on the domestic money supply through open 

market operations, discussed later.

global economy in the late 1920s and early 1930s.
9
  Likewise, economic historians have 

pointed out that, under the real bills doctrine, the Fed increased the money supply 

precisely at those times at which business activity and upward pressures on prices were 

strongest; that is, monetary policy was procyclical.  Thus, the Fed’s actions tended to 

increase rather than decrease the volatility in economic activity and prices.
10


During this early period, the new central bank did make an important addition to 

its menu of policy tools.  Initially, the Fed’s main tools were the quantity of its lending 

through the discount window and the interest rate at which it lent, the discount rate.  

Early on, however, to generate earnings to finance its operations, the Federal Reserve 

began purchasing government securities in the open market--what came to be known as 

open market operations.  In the early 1920s, Fed officials discovered that these operations 

affected the supply and cost of bank reserves and, consequently, the terms on which 

banks extended credit to their customers.  Subsequently, of course, open market 

operations became a principal monetary policy tool, one that allowed the Fed to interact 

with the broader financial markets, not only with banks.
11


I’ve discussed the original mandate and early policy framework of the Fed.  What 

about its accountability to the public?  As this audience knows, when the Federal Reserve 

was established, the question of whether it should be a private or a public institution was 

highly contentious.  The compromise solution created a hybrid Federal Reserve System.  

The System was headed by a governmentally appointed Board, which initially included 

the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the Currency.  But the 12 regional 

Reserve Banks were placed under a mixture of public and private oversight, including

board members drawn from the private sector, and they were given considerable scope to 

make policy decisions that applied to their own Districts.  For example, Reserve Banks 

were permitted to set their own discount rates, subject to a minimum set by the Board. 

While the founders of the Federal Reserve hoped that this new institution would 

provide financial and hence economic stability, the policy framework and the institutional 

structure would prove inadequate to the challenges the Fed would soon face.  

The Great Depression 

The Great Depression was the Federal Reserve’s most difficult test.  Tragically, 

the Fed failed to meet its mandate to maintain financial stability.  In particular, although 

the Fed provided substantial liquidity to the financial system following the 1929 stock 

market crash, its response to the subsequent banking panics was limited at best; the 

widespread bank failures and the collapse in money and credit that ensued were major 

sources of the economic downturn.
12

  Bagehot’s dictum to lend freely at a penalty rate in 

the face of panic appeared to have few adherents at the Federal Reserve of that era.
13


Economists have also identified a number of instances from the late 1920s to the 

early 1930s when Federal Reserve officials, in the face of the sharp economic contraction 

and financial upheaval, either tightened monetary policy or chose inaction.  Some 

historians trace these policy mistakes to the early death of Benjamin Strong, governor of 

the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in 1928, which left the decentralized system 

without an effective leader.
14

  Whether valid or not, this hypothesis raises the interesting 

question of what intellectual framework an effective leader would have drawn on at the 

                                                 
12

 See Friedman and Schwartz (1963). 
13

 Meltzer (2003, pp. 282, 729-30) notes that Board members discussed Bagehot’s ideas but nevertheless 

did not integrate them fully into their approach to policy.

 See Friedman and Schwartz (1963, chapter 7).

time to develop and justify a more activist monetary policy.  The degree to which the 

gold standard actually constrained U.S. monetary policy during the early 1930s is 

debated; but the gold standard philosophy clearly did not encourage the sort of highly 

expansionary policies that were needed.
15

  The same can be said for the real bills 

doctrine, which apparently led policymakers to conclude, on the basis of low nominal 

interest rates and low borrowings from the Fed, that monetary policy was appropriately 

supportive and that further actions would be fruitless.
16

  Historians have also noted the 

prevalence at the time of yet another counterproductive doctrine:  the so-called 

liquidationist view, that depressions perform a necessary cleansing function.
17

  It may be 

that the Federal Reserve suffered less from lack of leadership in the 1930s than from the 

lack of an intellectual framework for understanding what was happening and what needed 

to be done. 

The Fed’s inadequate policy frameworks ultimately collapsed under the weight of 

economic failures, new ideas, and political developments.  The international gold 

standard was abandoned during the 1930s.  The real bills doctrine likewise lost prestige 

after the disaster of the 1930s; for example, the Banking Act of 1935 instructed the 

Federal Reserve to use open market operations with consideration of “the general credit 

situation of the country,” not just to focus narrowly on short-term liquidity needs.
18

  The 

Congress also expanded the Fed’s ability to provide credit through the discount window, 

                                                 
15

 Wicker (1965), Temin (1989), and Eichengreen (1992) suggest that U.S. policymakers felt constrained 

by the gold standard.  In contrast, Hsieh and Romer (2006), as well as Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz 

(2002), focus on the short-lived monetary expansion in 1932 as evidence against the existence of important 

constraints on the Federal Reserve.

allowing loans to a broader array of counterparties, secured by a broader variety of 

collateral.
19


The experience of the Great Depression had major ramifications for all three 

aspects of the Federal Reserve I am discussing here:  its goals, its policy framework, and 

its accountability to the public.  With respect to goals, the high unemployment of the 

Depression--and the fear that high unemployment would return after World War II--

elevated the maintenance of full employment as a goal of macroeconomic policy.  The 

Employment Act of 1946 made the promotion of employment a general objective for the 

federal government.  Although the Fed did not have a formal employment goal until the 

Federal Reserve Reform Act of 1977 codified “maximum employment,” along with 

“stable prices,” as part of the Fed’s so-called dual mandate, earlier legislation nudged the 

central bank in that direction.
20

  For example, legislators described the intent of the 

Banking Act of 1935 as follows:  “To increase the ability of the banking system to 

promote stability of employment and business, insofar as this is possible within the scope 

of monetary action and credit administration.”
21


The policy framework to support this new approach reflected the development of 

macroeconomic theories--including the work of Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher, Ralph 

Hawtrey, Dennis Robertson, and John Maynard Keynes--that laid the foundations for 

understanding how monetary policy could affect real activity and employment and help 

                                                 
19

 For example, section 10B enhanced the powers of the Federal Reserve to lend to member banks, and 

sections 13(3) and 13(13) enabled the Federal Reserve to provide short-term credit to a wide range of 

potential borrowers in specific circumstances.   
20

 More precisely, the three statutory objectives for monetary policy set forth in the Federal Reserve 

Reform Act of 1977 are maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The 

dual mandate refers to the first two goals, and the long-term interest rate goal is viewed as likely to emerge 

from the macroeconomic environment associated with achievement of the employment and price stability 

goals (Mishkin, 2007).  Thus, the interest rate goal of the Federal Reserve Reform Act can be regarded as 

subsumed within the dual mandate.  
21

 See U.S. Congress (1935).

reduce cyclical fluctuations.  At the same time, the Federal Reserve became less focused 

on its original mandate of preserving financial stability, perhaps in part because it felt 

superseded by the creation during the 1930s of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation 

and the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with other reforms intended to make 

the financial system more stable. 

In the area of governance and accountability to the public, policymakers also 

recognized the need for reforms to improve the Federal Reserve’s structure and 

decisionmaking.  The Banking Act of 1935 simultaneously bolstered the legal 

independence of the Federal Reserve and provided for stronger central control by the 

Federal Reserve Board.  In particular, the act created the modern configuration of the 

Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), giving the Board the majority of votes on the 

Committee, while removing the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller of the 

Currency from the Board.  In practice, however, the Treasury continued to have 

considerable sway over monetary policy after 1933, with one economic historian 

describing the Fed as “in the back seat.”
22

  During World War II, the Federal Reserve 

used its tools to support the war financing efforts.  However, even after the war, Federal 

Reserve policy remained subject to considerable Treasury influence.  It was not until the 

1951 Accord with the Treasury that the Federal Reserve began to recover genuine 

independence in setting monetary policy.     

The Great Inflation and Disinflation 

Once the Federal Reserve regained its policy independence, its goals centered on 

the price stability and employment objectives laid out in the Employment Act of 1946.  In 

the early postwar decades, the Fed used open market operations and the discount rate to 

                                                 
22

 See Meltzer (2003).

influence short-term market interest rates, and the federal funds rate gradually emerged as 

the preferred operating target.  Low and stable inflation was achieved for most of the 

1950s and the early 1960s.  However, beginning in the mid-1960s, inflation began a long 

climb upward, partly because policymakers proved to be too optimistic about the 

economy’s ability to sustain rapid growth without inflation.
23


Two mechanisms might have mitigated the damage from that mistaken optimism.  

First, a stronger policy response to inflation--more like that observed in the 1950s--

certainly would have helped.
24

  Second, Fed policymakers could have reacted to 

continued high readings on inflation by adopting a more realistic assessment of the 

economy’s productive potential.
25

  Instead, policymakers chose to emphasize so-called 

cost-push and structural factors as sources of inflation and saw wage- and price-setting as 

having become insensitive to economic slack.
26

  This perspective, which contrasted 

sharply with Milton Friedman’s famous dictum that “inflation is always and everywhere 

a monetary phenomenon,” led to Fed support for measures such as wage and price 

controls rather than monetary solutions to address inflation.
27

  A further obstacle was the 

view among many economists that the gains from low inflation did not justify the costs of 

achieving it.
28


The consequence of the monetary framework of the 1970s was two bouts of 

double-digit inflation.  Moreover, by the end of the decade, lack of commitment to

26

 See, for example, Poole (1979), Romer and Romer (2002a, 2013), Bernanke (2004), and Nelson (2005). 
27

 Estimates of the response of the federal funds rate to inflation for the 1970s generally show only a weak 

reaction.  See Judd and Rudebusch (1998); Taylor (1999a); and Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000).  For the 

quotation, see Friedman (1963, p.17).

 See DeLong (1997) and Taylor (1997) for a discussion of views during the 1970s on the costs of 

inflation.

controlling inflation had clearly resulted in inflation expectations becoming 

“unanchored,” with high estimates of trend inflation embedded in longer-term interest 

rates.   

As you know, under the leadership of Chairman Paul Volcker, the Federal 

Reserve in 1979 fundamentally changed its approach to the issue of ensuring price 

stability.  This change involved an important rethinking on the part of policymakers.  By 

the end of the 1970s, Federal Reserve officials increasingly accepted the view that 

inflation is a monetary phenomenon, at least in the medium and longer term; they became 

more alert to the risks of excessive optimism about the economy’s potential output; and 

they placed renewed emphasis on the distinction between real--that is, inflation-

adjusted--and nominal interest rates.
29

  The change in policy framework was initially tied 

to a change in operating procedures that put greater focus on growth in bank reserves, but 

the critical change--the willingness to respond more vigorously to inflation--endured even 

after the Federal Reserve resumed its traditional use of the federal funds rate as the policy 

instrument.
30

  The new regime also reflected an improved understanding of the 

importance of providing a firm anchor, secured by the credibility of the central bank, for 

the private sector’s inflation expectations.
31

  Finally, it entailed a changed view about the 

                                                 
29

 For discussion of these points, see Meltzer (2009b). 
30

 See, for example, Axilrod (1982). 
31

 Central banks’ emphasis on expectations management partly reflected lessons from the rational 

expectations literature of the 1970s.  Monetary policy implications of the rational expectations literature 

were further clarified by later research.  For example, Sargent (1982) brought out dramatically the 

dependence of inflation expectations on the monetary policy regime in his study of major disinflations, 

while rational expectations models were extended to include sticky prices (Fischer, 1977; Taylor, 1980; 

Rotemberg, 1982; Calvo, 1983) and interest rate rules (Sargent and Wallace, 1975; McCallum, 1981; 

Taylor, 1993, 1999b; Woodford, 2003).

dual mandate, in which policymakers regarded achievement of price stability as helping 

to provide the conditions necessary for sustained maximum employment.
32


The Great Moderation 

Volcker’s successful battle against inflation set the stage for the so-called Great 

Moderation of 1984 to 2007, during which the Fed enjoyed considerable success in 

achieving both objectives of its dual mandate.  Financial stability remained a goal, of 

course.  The Federal Reserve monitored threats to financial stability and responded when 

the financial system was upset by events such as the 1987 stock market crash and the 

terrorist attacks of 2001.  More routinely, it shared supervisory duties with other banking 

agencies.  Nevertheless, for the most part, financial stability did not figure prominently in 

monetary policy discussions during these years.  In retrospect, it is clear that 

macroeconomists--both inside and outside central banks--relied too heavily during that 

period on variants of the so-called Modigliani-Miller theorem, an implication of which is 

that the details of the structure of the financial system can be ignored when analyzing the 

behavior of the broader economy.  

An important development of the Great Moderation was the increasing emphasis 

that central banks around the world put on communication and transparency, as 

economists and policymakers reached consensus on the value of communication in 

attaining monetary policy objectives.
33

  Federal Reserve officials, like those at other 

central banks, had traditionally been highly guarded in their public pronouncements.  

They believed, for example, that the ability to take markets by surprise was important for 

                                                 
32

 See Lindsey, Orphanides, and Rasche (2005). 
33

 See Woodford (2005).  Many of these principles were codified in the emerging doctrine of inflation 

targeting, the practice of which was greatly advanced by central banks in other countries.  One of the most 

notable examples is New Zealand’s introduction of inflation targeting in 1990.

influencing financial conditions.
34

  Thus, although Fed policymakers of the 1980s and 

early 1990s had become somewhat more explicit about policy objectives and strategy, the 

same degree of transparency was not forthcoming on monetary policy decisions and 

operations.
35

  The release of a postmeeting statement by the FOMC, a practice that began 

in 1994, was, therefore, an important watershed.  Over time, the statement was expanded 

to include more detailed information about the reason for the policy decision and an 

indication of the balance of risks.
36


In addition to improving the effectiveness of monetary policy, these developments 

in communications also enhanced the public accountability of the Federal Reserve.  

Accountability is, of course, essential for policy independence in a democracy.  During 

this period, economists found considerable evidence that central banks that are afforded 

policy independence in the pursuit of their mandated objectives deliver better economic 

outcomes.
37


One cannot look back at the Great Moderation today without asking whether the 

sustained economic stability of the period somehow promoted the excessive risk-taking 

that followed.  The idea that this long period of calm lulled investors, financial firms, and 

financial regulators into paying insufficient attention to building risks must have some 

truth in it.  I don’t think we should conclude, though, that we therefore should not strive 

to achieve economic stability.  Rather, the right conclusion is that, even in (or perhaps, 

especially in) stable and prosperous times, monetary policymakers and financial

regulators should regard safeguarding financial stability to be of equal importance as--

indeed, a necessary prerequisite for--maintaining macroeconomic stability.  

Macroeconomists and historians will continue to debate the sources of the 

remarkable economic performance during the Great Moderation.
38

  My own view is that 

the improvements in the monetary policy framework and in monetary policy 

communication, including, of course, the better management of inflation and the 

anchoring of inflation expectations, were important reasons for that strong performance.  

However, we have learned in recent years that while well-managed monetary policy may 

be necessary for economic stability, it is not sufficient. 

The Financial Crisis, the Great Recession, and Today  

It has been about six years since the first signs of the financial crisis appeared in 

the United States, and we are still working to achieve a full recovery from its effects.  

What lessons should we take for the future from this experience, particularly in the 

context of a century of Federal Reserve history? 

The financial crisis and the ensuing Great Recession reminded us of a lesson that 

we learned both in the 19th century and during the Depression but had forgotten to some 

extent, which is that severe financial instability can do grave damage to the broader 

economy.  The implication is that a central bank must take into account risks to financial 

stability if it is to help achieve good macroeconomic performance.  Today, the Federal 

Reserve sees its responsibilities for the maintenance of financial stability as coequal with 

its responsibilities for the management of monetary policy, and we have made substantial 

                                                 
38

 For a sampling of the debate, see Stock and Watson (2003); Ahmed, Levin, and Wilson (2004); Dynan, 

Elmendorf, and Sichel (2006); and Davis and Kahn (2008).

institutional changes in recognition of this change in goals.  In a sense, we have come full 

circle, back to the original goal of the Federal Reserve of preventing financial panics.
39


How should a central bank enhance financial stability?  One means is by 

assuming the lender-of-last-resort function that Bagehot understood and described 

140 years ago, under which the central bank uses its power to provide liquidity to ease 

market conditions during periods of panic or incipient panic.  The Fed’s many liquidity 

programs played a central role in containing the crisis of 2008 to 2009.  However, putting 

out the fire is not enough; it is also important to foster a financial system that is 

sufficiently resilient to withstand large financial shocks.  Toward that end, the Federal 

Reserve, together with other regulatory agencies and the Financial Stability Oversight 

Council, is actively engaged in monitoring financial developments and working to 

strengthen financial institutions and markets.  The reliance on stronger regulation is 

informed by the success of New Deal regulatory reforms, but current reform efforts go 

even further by working to identify and defuse risks not only to individual firms but to 

the financial system as a whole, an approach known as macroprudential regulation.   

Financial stability is also linked to monetary policy, though these links are not yet 

fully understood.  Here the Fed’s evolving strategy is to make monitoring, supervision, 

and regulation the first line of defense against systemic risks; to the extent that risks 

remain, however, the FOMC strives to incorporate these risks in the cost-benefit analysis 

applied to all monetary policy actions.

What about the monetary policy framework?  In general, the Federal Reserve’s 

policy framework inherits many of the elements put in place during the Great

Moderation.  These features include the emphasis on preserving the Fed’s inflation 

credibility, which is critical for anchoring inflation expectations, and a balanced approach 

in pursuing both parts of the Fed’s dual mandate in the medium term.  We have also 

continued to increase the transparency of monetary policy.  For example, the 

Committee’s communications framework now includes a statement of its longer-run 

goals and monetary policy strategy.
41

  In that statement, the Committee indicated that it 

judged that inflation at a rate of 2 percent (as measured by the annual change in the price 

index for personal consumption expenditures) is most consistent over the longer run with 

the FOMC’s dual mandate.  FOMC participants also regularly provide estimates of the 

longer-run normal rate of unemployment; those estimates currently have a central 

tendency of 5.2 to 6.0 percent.  By helping to anchor longer-term expectations, this 

transparency gives the Federal Reserve greater flexibility to respond to short-run 

developments.  This framework, which combines short-run policy flexibility with the 

discipline provided by the announced targets, has been described as constrained 

discretion.
42

  Other communication innovations include early publication of the minutes 

of FOMC meetings and quarterly postmeeting press conferences by the Chairman.  

 The framework for implementing monetary policy has evolved further in recent 

years, reflecting both advances in economic thinking and a changing policy environment.  

Notably, following the ideas of Lars Svensson and others, the FOMC has moved toward a 

framework that ties policy settings more directly to the economic outlook, a so-called 

forecast-based approach.
43

  In particular, the FOMC has released more detailed 

                                                 
41

 The statement can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20120125c.htm.

 In a forecast-based approach, monetary policymakers inform the public of their medium-term targets--

say, a specific value for the inflation rate--and attempt to vary the instruments of policy as needed to meet

statements following its meetings that have related the outlook for policy to prospective 

economic developments and has introduced regular summaries of the individual 

economic projections of FOMC participants (including for the target federal funds rate).  

The provision of additional information about policy plans has helped Fed policymakers 

deal with the constraint posed by the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates; in 

particular, by offering guidance about how policy will respond to economic 

developments, the Committee has been able to increase policy accommodation, even 

when the short-term interest rate is near zero and cannot be meaningfully reduced 

further.
44

  The Committee has also sought to influence interest rates further out on the 

yield curve, notably through its securities purchases.  Other central banks in advanced 

economies, also confronted with the effective lower bound on short-term interest rates, 

have taken similar measures. 

In short, the recent crisis has underscored the need both to strengthen our 

monetary policy and financial stability frameworks and to better integrate the two.  We 

have made progress on both counts, but more needs to be done.  In particular, the 

complementarities among regulatory and supervisory policies (including macroprudential 

policy), lender-of-last-resort policy, and standard monetary policy are increasingly 

evident.  Both research and experience are needed to help the Fed and other central banks 

develop comprehensive frameworks that incorporate all of these elements.  The broader 

conclusion is what might be described as the overriding lesson of the Federal Reserve’s 

history:  that central banking doctrine and practice are never static.  We and other central 

                                                                                                                                                 
that target over time.  In contrast, an instrument-based approach involves providing the public information 

about how the monetary policy committee plans to vary its policy instrument--typically, a short-term 

interest rate, like the federal funds rate--in response to economic conditions.  See Svensson (2003). 
44

 See Yellen (2012) for an elaboration of this point.
