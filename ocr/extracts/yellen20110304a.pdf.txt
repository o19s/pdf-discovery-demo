Nearly four decades have elapsed since the demise of Bretton Woods, and during 

that time, the international monetary and financial system has undergone a significant 

transformation.  The changes that have occurred reflect deliberate policy choices by the 

official sector as well as the organic interactions of investors, institutions, and advancing 

technologies.  Judging by the standards of global economic growth, stable prices, and 

financial stability,  the international monetary and financial system, in its current 

incarnation, has a decidedly mixed record.  Wrenching crises and economic distress, 

notably including the difficult experience of the past several years, have punctuated 

periods of solid growth, low inflation, and financial stability.  Thus, the subject of today’s 

discussion is vitally important, and I am pleased to contribute my thoughts on steps we 

can take to improve our international economic order.1  

In evaluating our policy priorities, I find it helpful to distinguish between the 

international monetary system and the international financial system.2  The international 

monetary system is the set of rules, conventions, and institutions associated with 

monetary policy, official capital flows, and exchange rates.  It also includes mechanisms 

to provide official sector support to countries facing funding pressures.  The international 

financial system is much broader, encompassing both private and official participants in 

global financial markets.  I consider this distinction important in thinking about how to 

reduce the incidence and severity of future crises while preserving a prosperous global 

economy.

In the case of the recent global financial crisis and recession, I would apportion 

responsibility to inadequacies in both the monetary and financial systems.  With respect 

to the international monetary system, the basic story is now quite familiar:  Strong capital 

outflows from countries with chronic current account surpluses--in part reflecting heavily 

managed exchange rates, reserve accumulation, and other shortcomings in the operation 

of the international monetary system--put downward pressure on real interest rates, in 

turn boosting asset prices (particularly for housing) and enhancing the availability of 

credit.  These developments contributed significantly to the buildup of financial 

imbalances, but they were not, on their own, sufficient to have engendered the massive 

financial crisis we experienced. 

Had the additional domestic credit associated with these capital inflows been used 

effectively, the imbalances need not have led to financial ruin.  In the United States and 

other countries with current account deficits, however, borrowing too often supported 

excessive spending on housing and consumption, rather than financing productive 

investment.  Most important, declines in underwriting standards, breakdowns in lending 

oversight by investors and rating agencies, increased use of opaque financial products, 

and more-general inadequacies in risk management by private financial institutions 

helped foster a dangerous and unsustainable credit boom.  With the financial system 

evolving rapidly, supervisors and regulators, both in the United States and in many other 

countries, failed to recognize and address the mounting vulnerabilities.  In short, these 

failures rooted in the financial system interacted with weaknesses in the global monetary 

system to create stresses and instabilities that eventually triggered--and amplified--the 

recent financial crisis and subsequent recession.

Other economic crises can similarly be traced to the interaction of weaknesses in 

the global monetary and financial systems.  For example, the Asian financial crisis of the 

late 1990s was rooted in failures to prudently allocate capital to productive investments--

failures of financial intermediation.  But these problems were made worse by 

characteristics of the international monetary system, as heavily managed exchange rates 

encouraged excessive foreign currency borrowing.  The collapse of the Thai baht in mid-

1997, which marked the beginning of the crisis, resulted in substantial balance sheet 

losses--particularly for that country’s banks--and triggered a widespread reappraisal of 

risk in the entire region.  As investors lost confidence, capital fled these economies, 

precipitating a severe downturn.  As in the recent experience of the United States, better 

management of domestic financial systems in the emerging Asian economies would have 

greatly limited, if not prevented, the financial vulnerabilities that ultimately resulted in 

the crisis, but policies regarding exchange rate regimes and capital flows were also an 

important part of the story. 

The conclusion I draw from these and other financial crises is that we must 

strengthen both the financial system and the monetary system to create a more stable and 

less crisis-prone global economy.  Improving the international financial system requires 

better management of national financial sectors and also enhanced international 

cooperation and coordination, because in a globalized economy with strong, complex, 

cross-border linkages, even domestic financial stresses can have serious international 

repercussions.   

Countries need to work together to ensure that weaknesses in the global financial 

system are recognized and addressed.  I am encouraged by the progress we have made in

strengthening the banking sector through the capital and liquidity requirements of 

Basel III.  We have also made important strides in improving international cooperation 

and coordination in the supervision of systemically important financial institutions, 

whose operations and exposures span numerous jurisdictions.  That said, we need to 

continue working toward viable resolution mechanisms for these institutions.  Further 

work is also needed to improve our macroprudential approach to managing 

vulnerabilities.  And we must collaborate to ensure that risky activities do not migrate to 

the shadows of the financial system in an attempt to circumvent regulatory authorities.   

We must also strengthen the international monetary system.  We need a system 

characterized by more open capital accounts, flexible exchange rates, and independent 

monetary policies.  Open capital accounts, supported by appropriate financial supervision 

and regulation, channel savings to their most productive uses, thereby enhancing welfare.  

Exchange rate flexibility improves domestic macroeconomic management, allowing 

countries to pursue independent monetary policies tailored to their individual needs, and 

limits unwelcome spillovers to other economies.  Such a system can also flexibly adapt to 

changing economic and financial realities as countries develop, technology progresses, 

and shocks buffet the global economy. 

Our current international monetary system does not yet fulfill these objectives.  

We now have a hybrid arrangement in which some economies have flexible exchange 

rates, maintain open capital accounts, and pursue independent monetary policy--a 

sensible reconciliation of the so-called impossible trinity.  But other countries heavily 

manage their exchange rates, with varying mixes of capital mobility and monetary policy 

independence.

Inflexible exchange rates in these countries have tended to inhibit adjustment of 

unsustainable global imbalances in trade and capital flows.  Indeed, as I noted, such 

imbalances appear to have fostered the buildup of vulnerabilities in the run-up to the 

recent financial crisis.  Countries with current account surpluses and restricted capital 

flows have been able to resist currency appreciation for prolonged periods, even when 

justified by underlying fundamentals.  In principle, adjustment of imbalances could occur 

if countries permitting relatively limited movements in nominal exchange rates allow 

their national price levels to adjust over time.  But sterilization operations and other 

policy tools can, and often have, restrained such adjustment.  Meanwhile, countries with 

current account deficits should take steps to increase national saving, including by putting 

in place credible plans to reduce their fiscal deficits in the longer run.   

The international monetary system, in effect, still suffers from the same 

asymmetry that bedeviled the Bretton Woods system--namely, a marked differential in 

the pressures facing surplus and deficit countries to permit automatic adjustments or to 

undertake policy to reduce persistent global imbalances.  Surplus countries can resist 

adjustment by restricting capital flows and exchange rate movements, but deficit 

countries are forced to adjust when they run out of international reserves or lose access to 

external borrowing.  This asymmetry has served to inhibit the global rebalancing process, 

and it could threaten the ongoing recovery:  If deficit countries curtail spending without 

offsetting spending increases in the surplus countries, aggregate demand would decline, 

with adverse consequences for the global economy.    

Thus, in my view, we need to continue working toward an international monetary 

system characterized by more-flexible exchange rates, open capital accounts, and 


 - 6 -

independent monetary policies that will facilitate the adjustment of global imbalances.  

But we must recognize that countries face diverse challenges in such a transition.  For 

countries with undervalued currencies, the adoption of more-flexible exchange rates 

requires an internal shift in resources across sectors--a transition that takes time.  As 

noted earlier, the recent crisis has also uncovered numerous flaws in the functioning of 

regulation of our financial system, and these, too, will take time to correct.  Finally, 

although I have not addressed this concern in my remarks today, the expansion of public-

sector deficits and debts in many countries poses very serious medium- to long-run risks 

for both the international monetary and financial systems that will need to be addressed. 

Against the background of these longer-term issues, we must also support 

countries’ efforts to address their more immediate challenges.  Some advanced 

economies struggle with weak demand, high unemployment, and disinflation.  Many 

emerging market economies face increasing inflationary pressures and capital inflows 

amid strong growth.  In light of these differing challenges, a cooperative spirit among 

policymakers is essential to ensure prosperity of the global economy.
