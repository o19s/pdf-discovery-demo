Inviting Participation: The Public’s Role in Stress Testing’s Next Chapter 


Remarks by 

Randal K. Quarles 

Vice Chairman for Supervision 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 

to the 

Council for Economic Education 

New York, New York 

February 6, 2019


 Thank you, Nan, for that kind introduction, and thank you to President Mester of the 

Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland for inviting me to speak this evening. I am honored to be 

here and to support the mission that you and the Council for Economic Education have worked 

so hard to advance--that every student in America gets a strong, early start on their financial 

education.  

That mission is critical in its own right, but it also reflects the deeply held value of 

participation--of giving young people the chance to shape not just their own futures, but also the 

futures of their communities and their country. Because so much of the language of finance is 

couched in terms of metrics and rationality, we often forget that finance is something we never 

do alone. It is, by definition, a collaboration, which helps us work together to achieve common 

goals.   

The Federal Reserve is no exception. Tonight, I want to briefly discuss the role that 

participation plays in the Federal Reserve’s work and outline one effort to solicit broad 

participation--an upcoming conference on stress tests, intended to make those tests more open, 

transparent, and effective. 

 Public institutions exist under a grant of trust from the people they serve, to pursue a 

specific policy goal. When the public holds an institution accountable for that grant, the 

institution becomes stronger. The Federal Reserve System we know today emerged through 

decades of legislation, public consultation, and debate--from the original Federal Reserve Act, 

which created the Federal Reserve System, to the Banking Act of 1935,1 which established the 

modern Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), to the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord of

1951, which ensured the separation of monetary and fiscal policy.2 These changes made our 

economy and our country stronger, because they improved the Federal Reserve’s ability to 

accomplish the mission Congress assigned it.  

Throughout this evolution, a key principle has been that accountability allows the Federal 

Reserve to be independent--that we are subject to challenge, to counterargument, and to the 

emergence of new evidence and ideas. For our work to remain legitimate, the public must be able 

to see, understand, and engage with our efforts; to reaffirm their support when we have earned it; 

and to offer informed guidance on when to change course. 

 Accountability is only one reason the Federal Reserve relies on public outreach and 

participation. We also rely on participation for our effectiveness, because the best ideas in 

finance and economics can, and often do, come from a wide variety of sources. Agencies like the 

Federal Reserve are a collection of expertise--informed by experience and positioned to turn a 

broad range of information into policy. But we are not, and cannot be, a monopoly on insight or 

wisdom.  

 The Federal Reserve recognizes these limits, and the need to invite new ideas, through a 

variety of initiatives. We seek out a qualified, diverse workforce, and foster an inclusive 

workplace.3 We meet frequently with a range of advisory councils, drawing on expertise in 

banking, modeling, and consumer and community finance.4 We have increased transparency 

around our policy process and issued new reports on financial stability and banking supervision

and regulation, with new details about our work.5 And across the Federal Reserve System, our 

staff publishes a wide range of economic and policy research and plays an active role in 

academic discourse. 

 Monetary policy itself shows the value of participation and transparency. U.S. monetary 

policy is the sole responsibility of the Federal Reserve. Yet some of the most important 

innovations in the field have come from outside the Reserve System. Since 1935, we have 

decided monetary policy by committee, a structure that has served us well because it is designed 

to capture different views of a wide and varied national economy. And over the past several 

decades, the FOMC has greatly increased its own transparency--from postmeeting 

announcements, to announcing an objective for inflation, to a published survey of economic 

projections, to postmeeting press conferences (which will now take place after every FOMC 

meeting).6 As many of you know, over the course of 2019, we will be reviewing our monetary 

policy strategy, tools, and communication practices, and we will hold a research conference on 

the subject with outside speakers, as well as “Fed Listens” events at a number of Reserve Banks, 

to hear from a broad range of constituencies. But these improvements are more than a simple 

matter of disclosure. They are an invitation to participate, and a way to provide the public with 

the means and opportunity to inform our work.

6 The FOMC’s “Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,” first issued in January 2012 and 
reaffirmed each January, specifies that the Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by 
the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run 
with the Federal Reserve’s statutory mandate and that the Committee would be concerned if inflation were running 
persistently above or below this objective.

 This year, we are taking similar steps to improve a cornerstone of our post-crisis rules. 

Supervisory stress tests offer an independent and valuable lens on the health of the banking 

system. They offer us a forward-looking measurement of bank capital, a view of common and 

systemic risks across the banking sector, and a broader understanding of the health of the 

financial system. The results are valuable for markets, analysts, and ultimately, the participating 

firms. 

 Ten years have passed since the Federal Reserve conducted its first supervisory stress 

tests. That initial experiment helped stabilize financial markets and shore up our banking system 

at a critical and uncertain time. Our challenge now is to preserve the strength of the test, while 

improving its efficiency, transparency, and integration into the post-crisis regulatory framework. 

To that end, the stress tests have not remained static. Just in the past several days, the 

Board acted to suspend stress tests this year for lower-risk firms--generally, those with total 

assets between $100 billion and $250 billion.7 That move follows the passage of the Economic 

Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.8 The extended cycle provides 

administrative burden relief for these institutions and recognizes the different risks that they 

typically pose--especially compared to the largest and most complex firms, whose failure poses 

the greatest risk to the real economy. Even with this change, the stress tests remain a core part of 

our supervision of these firms. Our experience with this “interim” year will inform the move to a

permanently longer testing cycle--a change that would, of course, be subject to a full notice and 

comment process.9 

 Improvements like these are necessary to ensure our supervisory framework evolves from 

its post-crisis origins to an effective steady state. The question of how best to consolidate the 

gains from the first 10 years of stress testing deserves the attention and effort of the country’s 

best minds. We should welcome changes and novel ideas, even when they explore stress testing 

in a new and unfamiliar light.  

  In July, as a forum for such ideas, we will host a public conference focused on the 

transparency and effectiveness of stress testing. Called Stress Testing: A Discussion and Review, 

the event will convene panel discussions, drawing on a mix of presenters with industry, 

academic, and regulatory backgrounds. It will involve written papers, which will be compiled 

and published to spur further research. We expect the insights from the conference to inform the 

evolution of our stress-testing framework--and we hope to continue the conversation well after 

the conference ends. 

  This input is as essential to our work as any public outreach we do. Stress testing 

provides insight into a dynamic financial system, and our stress-testing process must be dynamic 

as well. More broadly, the core of the Federal Reserve’s independence is a broad consensus 

                                                           
9 Changes proposed as part of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act have been 
proposed but not finalized. Similarly, changes as part of the proposed “stress capital buffer” have been proposed but 
not finalized. Both proposals will inform the final rule governing the methodology for capital distributions. See

around the value and public worth of our mission. The Federal Reserve is the steward and trustee 

of that mission, but the public is its owner. To serve the public, we must not just allow input, but 

welcome it; not just permit debate, but foster it; not just allow participation, but treat it as 

essential to our work. 

 Thank you.
