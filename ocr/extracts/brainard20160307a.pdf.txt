 This is a fitting moment to take stock of economic and financial developments, 

following a volatile start to the year.  I will begin by reviewing the outlook, then provide 

a brief recap of how financial market liquidity has fared, and finish by commenting on 

the resilience and resolvability of the large interconnected banks.1 

Outlook for the United States 

I am heartened by the continued strong progress on employment and the resilience 

of American consumers, which stand out against a considerably more challenging global 

backdrop.  I am pleased with the continued strength in the U.S. labor market, which is 

drawing people back into the labor force.  In February, the unemployment rate was 4.9 

percent--a level that is one-half its peak during the depths of the recession in 2009.  Last 

Friday, we learned that employment growth has averaged 223,000 per month over the 

past 12 months.  And there likely is some room to go:  The prime-age employment-to-

population ratio remains 1-3/4 percentage points below levels prevailing prior to the 

financial crisis, while a relatively large share of employees who are working part time 

would prefer to work full time.  In addition, wage growth remains relatively slow.  

Domestic activity continues to grow at a moderate pace.  The pace of consumer 

spending, after slowing some at the end of last year, looks to have picked up in January, 

and auto sales remained strong in February.  Over the past two years, consumption has 

increased at about a 3 percent pace, on average, and I expect to see growth to continue at 

close to this pace based on solid job and income growth--together with elevated readings 

                                                 
I am grateful to Andrew Figura for his assistance in preparing this text.

Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.

on consumer confidence and the boost to household purchasing power from persistent 

declines in energy prices. 

The housing sector has also contributed steadily to growth over the past year.  

With housing activity well below pre-recession norms, it appears there is still scope for 

continued growth in construction activity.   

In contrast, sectors of the economy that are sensitive to energy prices or 

international demand have been a drag.  In response to the plunge in oil prices, 

investment in drilling and mining structures fell 50 percent last year, and continued 

reductions in the number of drilling rigs this year suggest that further declines are likely.2  

At the same time, firms and workers in the energy sector have experienced extreme 

financial difficulties and severe job losses.  

Although the euro area and Japan are recovering, their demand growth remains 

very low, despite extraordinary monetary accommodation.  In emerging market 

economies growth last year came in at only one-half the average rate from 2009 to 2013.  

Because China has accounted for one-third of the growth in world Gross Domestic 

Product (GDP) and trade, the recent slippage in Chinese economic growth is having an 

important effect globally.  Even if Chinese growth does not slide further, the changing 

composition of its growth toward consumption and services and away from resource-

intensive manufacturing and investment will pose important challenges to commodity 

exporters and other emerging economies, especially since China had previously 

accounted for upwards of one-half of global imports of many base metals. 

                                                 
2 Despite the drop-off in drilling investment, oil production has been surprisingly resilient, as producers 
have increased the productivity of established wells.

Weak foreign demand relative to the United States has pushed down net exports 

and contributed to a nearly 20 percent strengthening of the real trade-weighted dollar 

since mid-2014.  As a result, net exports subtracted a little more than 1/2 percentage point 

from GDP growth in 2014 and 2015, and econometric models suggest that past 

appreciation will lead to close to another 1 percentage point subtraction this year.3 

These effects are especially prominent in the U.S. manufacturing sector, where 

output is sluggish, and the agricultural sector has also been hit hard by the rise in the 

value of the dollar.  In addition, with profits at many firms adversely affected by the rise 

in the dollar and weak demand abroad, business fixed investment increased only 1-1/2 

percent last year after contributing significantly to growth earlier in the recovery. 

On balance, in recent months, financial conditions have tightened somewhat with 

equity prices moving lower and corporate risk spreads widening, although conditions 

have improved in recent weeks.  In addition, progress on inflation has been slow.  Prices 

for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) have increased 1.3 percent over the 12 

months through January, well below the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) 2 

percent target.  Reductions in energy prices are, in part, responsible for this low rate, and 

if energy prices stabilize, top-line inflation should move higher.  Still, a stabilization in 

energy prices is not assured.  Market participants have been repeatedly surprised by the 

depth and persistence of oil price declines:  Both spot and far futures oil prices, for 

example, have fallen in five out of the past six quarters since mid-2014.

But even after discounting the influence of energy prices, core PCE inflation has 

been stubbornly stuck in the vicinity of 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent since 2012. 4  Most 

recently, the dollar has played an important role in holding down non-oil import prices, 

which fell 3-1/2 percent last year and subtracted an estimated 1/2 percentage point from 

core inflation.5  Should the dollar stabilize, the downward influence on inflation should 

dissipate.  But, as with oil prices, the movement in the value of the dollar has been more 

persistent than markets and many observers expected, with increases in every quarter 

since mid-2014. 

If the labor market continues to improve, higher resource utilization should also 

put some upward pressure on inflation going forward.  However, the effect of resource 

utilization on inflation is estimated to be much lower today than in past decades.6   

An important concern about persistently low inflation is that it can lead to a fall in 

longer-term inflation expectations, making it much more difficult to achieve our inflation 

target.  For the most part, longer-term inflation expectations appear to have remained 

reasonably stable, though there are some concerning signs.  Longer-term inflation 

expectations of professional forecasters and primary dealers have held quite steady in 

recent years at levels consistent with the FOMC’s target.  However, households’ inflation 

expectations appear to have moved down somewhat recently.  Five-to-10-year inflation 

                                                 
4 Core consumer price index (CPI) inflation has been 1/2 percentage point higher than core PCE inflation 
over the 12 months through January.  Over the past 15 years, core CPI inflation has averaged about 
1/4 percentage point more than core PCE inflation.  Much of the recent larger gap is due to differences in 
the coverage of health-care services and to differences in the weight accorded to housing services and 
health-care services.  The CPI only covers out-of-pocket expenditures for health-care services, while the 
PCE index covers a much broader range of spending.  Expenditures on housing are a larger share of the 
CPI than of the PCE index, and prices for housing services have increased at an above-average pace 
recently.

expectations in the University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers have edged lower over 

the past year or two with the level in February nearly 1/2 percentage point below the 10-

year average.  Three-year inflation expectations in the New York Federal Reserve’s 

Survey of Consumer Expectations have also moved steadily lower over the past two 

years, though the recent decline in energy prices may explain much of this drift. 

Notably, market-based measures of inflation compensation based on Treasury 

Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and nominal Treasury yields are at historically low 

levels.  At the five-year, five-year-ahead horizon, inflation compensation is 1 percentage 

point lower than mid-2014 levels.  Declines in swap-based measures of inflation 

compensation have been similar.  However, these declines appear correlated with oil 

prices, and it is not clear to what extent these declines reflect a change in inflation 

expectations, changes in investor demand for TIPS versus nominal Treasury securities, or 

an improvement in the risk characteristics of nominal Treasury securities versus other 

assets. 

Over the next couple of years, there are reasons to expect energy prices and the 

dollar to eventually stabilize, output to increase at around the moderate pace it has 

averaged over the recovery thus far, foreign growth to recover somewhat, the U.S. labor 

market to improve further, and inflation to move toward our 2 percent target.  However, 

there are risks around this baseline forecast, the most prominent of which lie to the 

downside.  For example, China faces risks as it navigates a sharp slowing in its goods 

sector, a large buildup in corporate debt, and an apparent surge in demand for foreign 

assets, although China possesses resources to deal with these challenges.  More broadly, 

sources of robust demand around the globe are few, and sources of weakness relatively

greater, as evidenced by persistently below target inflation in all of the major advanced 

economies.   

Monetary Policy 

In today’s circumstances, policy could usefully follow two simple guidelines.  

First, we should not take the strength in the U.S. labor market and consumption for 

granted.  Given weak and decelerating foreign demand, it is critical to carefully protect 

and preserve the progress we have made here at home through prudent adjustments to the 

policy path.  Tighter financial conditions and softer inflation expectations may pose risks 

to the downside for inflation and domestic activity.  From a risk-management 

perspective, this argues for patience as the outlook becomes clearer.7 

Second, we should put a high premium on clear evidence that inflation is moving 

toward our 2 percent target.  Inflation has persistently underperformed relative to our 

target.  Moreover, measures of inflation compensation and some survey-based measures 

of inflation expectations suggest that inflation expectations may have edged lower.  

Given the currently weak relationship between economic slack and inflation and the 

persistent, depressing effects of energy price declines and exchange rate increases, we 

should be cautious in assessing that a tightening labor market will soon move inflation 

back to 2 percent.  We should verify that this is, in fact, taking place.  In this regard, core 

PCE inflation increased 1.7 percent over the 12 months ending in January, a noticeable 

step-up from an increase of 1.3 percent over the preceding 12 months.8 

                                                 
7 To the extent that the neutral rate of interest--the rate that keeps output at its potential level and inflation 
at its target--has fallen in the United States and is low around the world, this may weigh on the policy path. 
See Laubach and Williams (2015), Hamilton and others (2015), Kiley (2015a), Johannsen and Mertens 
(2016), Del Negro and others (2015), Brainard (2015), and chapter 3 of World Economic Outlook 
(International Monetary Fund, 2014).   
8 Because the most recent 12-month change in core PCE prices includes several relatively large monthly 
increases in core PCE prices in the first part of 2015, it is possible that 12-month core PCE inflation will

Liquidity 

 In addition to raising uncertainty around the outlook, the recent financial market 

volatility has underscored the importance of ongoing attention to the resilience of market 

liquidity.  Although it is fair to say that the recent uptick in volatility has in part reduced 

earlier concerns about prolonged low volatility and associated reach-for-yield behavior, it 

has placed added focus on the resilience of liquidity, particularly in markets, such as the 

market for corporate bonds, that may be prone to gapping between liquidity demand and 

supply in stressed conditions.   

The Federal Reserve’s surveillance of liquidity conditions in financial markets has 

broadened and deepened considerably since the “taper tantrum” in mid-2013 and the 

events of October 2014 in the Treasury market.  The analysis so far suggests a few 

preliminary observations.  While it does not appear that day-to-day liquidity has declined 

notably, some characteristics of liquidity provision are changing.  Broadly, traditional 

price-based measures of liquidity such as bid-asked spreads and the price effect of a 

given trade size generally remain in line with pre-crisis norms in most markets.  In 

contrast, both anecdotes from market participants and the declining size of trades in some 

markets suggest it may have become more expensive to conduct, and may take more time 

to implement, large trades.9 

Moreover, there may be some deterioration in the resilience of liquidity at times 

of stress, along with a greater incidence of outsized intraday price movements.  Relatedly, 

liquidity appears to be more segmented based on the characteristics of the securities 

                                                 
move lower in coming months as these relatively large monthly increases drop out of the 12-month 
window.

being traded and the underlying structure of the markets in which they are traded.  Based 

on granular disaggregation of the traded securities, liquidity appears little changed in 

secondary markets that have traditionally been highly liquid, such as on-the-run Treasury 

bonds and highly rated corporate bonds.  By contrast, there has been some reduction in 

liquidity in the segments of these markets that have historically been less liquid.10 

The move toward somewhat greater segmentation of liquidity, in conjunction with 

ongoing electronification and acceleration of trade execution, might be contributing to 

increased linkages across markets.  Anecdotally, it appears market participants may be 

using relatively more liquid instruments to hedge exposures in other less liquid market 

segments, perhaps unintentionally contributing to increased correlation across markets.11 

From a broader financial stability perspective, the possible deterioration in the 

resilience of liquidity suggests a special focus on segments where price gaps are most 

likely to arise at times of stress between holders of relatively illiquid or thinly traded 

securities that want to sell and dealers with an apparently reduced willingness to take the 

other side of the trade, as indicated, for example, by leaner dealer inventory holdings.12  

Mutual funds holding relatively less liquid assets is one area of focus.  Despite having 

share prices that move with market prices, these funds can give rise to first-mover 

advantages for redeeming shareholders and create the potential for destabilizing waves of 

redemptions and asset fire sales if liquidity buffers and other tools to manage liquidity 

risk prove insufficient.13  In this regard, our surveillance has been closely monitoring for 

                                                 
10 See Adrian, Fleming, Vogt, and Wojtowicz (2016a); and Fleming (2016).  
11 See Dobrev and Schaumburg (2016). 
12 See Bank for International Settlements (2016).  
13 In particular, research has suggested that corporate bond funds exhibit herding behavior--that is, a 
tendency for waves of sales or purchases of common securities across funds.  This herding appears more 
significant for less liquid bonds, which could exacerbate the concerns noted above.  See Cai and others 
(2015).  Also, see Cetorelli, Duarte, and Eisenbach (2016) for estimates of the effects of asset fire sales.

any signs of liquidity strains associated with the recent increases in spreads for high-yield 

corporate bonds, as well as for idiosyncratic events affecting particular funds in this 

segment, such as the events surrounding the abrupt closing of Third Avenue 

Management’s Focused Credit Fund last December.   

More broadly, the regulatory agencies in the United States and the Financial 

Stability Board internationally have work under way focusing on possible fire-sale risk 

associated with the growing share of less liquid bonds held in asset management 

portfolios on behalf of investors who may be counting on same-day redemption when 

valuations fall.  The recent proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 

to ensure mutual funds have ample liquidity buffers under stressed scenarios and 

undertake measures to address the risk of heavy redemptions and fire sales is notable in 

this regard.  Our surveillance will continue to undertake more granular analysis of 

liquidity resilience and associated risks. 

Across financial markets, it is difficult to disentangle the effects on liquidity of 

changes in technology and market structure and changes in broker-dealer risk-

management practices in the wake of the crisis on the one hand and enhanced regulation 

on the other.  While the leverage ratio and other Dodd-Frank Act requirements likely are 

encouraging broker-dealers to be more rigorous about risk management in allocating 

balance sheet capacity to certain trading activities, the growing presence of proprietary 

firms using algorithmic trading in many of these markets, which predated the crisis, is 

also influencing trading dynamics in important ways.14  The Request for Information 

issued by the U.S. Treasury and the recent proposals from the Commodity Futures

Trading Commission and the SEC will be important in deepening our understanding.  

While acknowledging the role of regulation as a possible contributor, it is important to 

recognize that this regulation was designed to reduce the concentration of liquidity risk 

on the balance sheets of the large, interconnected banking organizations that proved to be 

a major amplifier of financial instability at the height of the crisis. 

Resilience and Resolvability 

This brings me to the last item on my agenda:  an update on efforts to strengthen 

the resilience and resolvability of these systemic banking organizations.  With recent and 

upcoming proposals, much of the new regulatory architecture will be in the process of 

implementation or in train.  Even so, I would expect the rules and their application to 

continue to be strengthened and modified as financial risks evolve, just as I would expect 

these rules to be increasingly tailored over time to better reflect risk profiles. 

As a result of the capital and liquidity regulations already in place as well as the 

associated stress tests, the eight most systemic U.S. banking organizations are now 

holding $800 billion more in high-quality liquid assets than they were in 2011 and $500 

billion more in common equity capital than they were in 2008.  These liquidity and 

capital buffers are designed to strengthen the going-concern resilience of systemic 

banking organizations during periods of market volatility and financial stress.  In 

addition, we recently released our proposed framework for determining the application of 

an additional countercyclical buffer to our large banking firms and made the first 

determination under the rule. 

On top of this, the capital surcharge we have proposed, which is designed to 

ensure the largest, most systemic banking organizations internalize the risk they pose to 


 - 11 - 

the system, is estimated to range from 1.0 to 4.5 percent of risk-weighted assets, based on 

2013 data, over and above the 7 percent minimum and capital conservation buffers under 

Basel III.  Indeed, it appears that some institutions may have already reduced their 

systemic footprint in anticipation of these additional charges. 

Of course, the crisis starkly illustrated that what seem like thick capital cushions 

in good times can become uncomfortably thin in the face of financial stress.  Our 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress-testing framework is 

arguably our most powerful tool for ensuring that these capital buffers remain robust to a 

variety of possible shocks to the trading and banking book exposures of the large, 

interconnected banking organizations.  Therefore, as we work to fine-tune and strengthen 

this framework, I would hope to see the capital surcharge for systemic banking 

organizations integrated into CCAR to ensure robustness, even as adjustments might be 

made on other parameters of the framework. 

Although today’s greatly enhanced common equity capital requirements should 

materially reduce the probability that a large bank might fail in response to a severe 

economic downturn or financial stress, it is not enough to reduce the risks of failure.  In 

parallel, our supervisory and regulatory efforts are raising the bar on ensuring that the 

large, interconnected banking organizations have in place credible plans and preparations 

as well as properly calibrated and positioned liquidity and loss absorbing capacity to 

ensure failure can take place in an orderly manner.   

To that end, we have proposed a Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity rule that contains 

a long-term debt requirement that is critical to the feasibility of bankruptcy for the 

systemic banking organizations.  It is a necessary counterpart to the Dodd-Frank Act 


 - 12 - 

requirement that large banking organizations have credible resolution plans and 

undertake preparations to make those plans operationally feasible.  In particular it 

requires the top-tier holding companies of systemic banking organizations to maintain a 

sufficiently large buffer of long-term debt that can be converted into equity and used to 

fully recapitalize their important operating subsidiaries in the event of bankruptcy.  The 

proposed levels of long-term debt are calibrated to the specific riskiness and scale of each 

institution’s activities, taking into account the likely shrinkage of the operations of their 

subsidiaries in resolution. 

 The requirement is designed to mitigate contagion, fire-sale, and run risks by 

providing comfort to depositors, short-term debt holders, and counterparties of the 

operating subsidiaries of the firm, since the long-term unsecured debt issued by the top-

tier holding company would be structurally subordinated to the claims on the operating 

subsidiaries.  The presence of long-term debt holders that will be bailed in ensures that 

taxpayer resources will not be used and should provide incentives to preserve the firm’s 

value as it approaches insolvency, thus aligning the firm’s interests with the public’s 

broader interest in financial stability.   

The Board has received many detailed comments on the proposed long-term debt 

rule.  Some have commented on the existing stock of outstanding long-term debt with 

acceleration clauses that might not qualify under the rule’s criteria and have proposed 

grandfathering as a possible solution.  Others have raised questions about whether the 

leverage ratio or the risk-based capital framework provides the more appropriate 

calibration benchmark for the minimum long-term debt requirement.  Comments from 

foreign banks have also addressed our proposal to impose internal long-term debt 


 - 13 - 

requirements on the U.S. intermediate holding companies of foreign banks and have 

asked, among other things, whether the proposed requirement should vary more 

depending on the resolution strategy of the parent foreign bank.  We are currently 

carefully reviewing these comments.  One thing is clear: the long-term debt requirement 

is a critical component in ending too big to fail. 

The long-term debt requirement together with rigorous resolution plans and 

operational preparedness, the capital surcharges along with the capital stress tests, and the 

availability of sufficient amounts of high-quality liquidity where it is most likely to be 

needed will all substantially decrease the risk that a large financial institution’s distress 

could pose to the broader financial system and help ensure that no banking institution is 

too large and too complex to fail.  They will move us closer to our goal of a safer, more 

responsible, and more resilient financial system.
