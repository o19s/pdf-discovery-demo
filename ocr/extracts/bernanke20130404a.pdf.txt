Hello.  I’m Ben Bernanke, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System.  I appreciate this opportunity to speak to the business and finance 

students and faculty--as well as the practicing financial professionals--attending the 

University of Dayton’s 13th annual RISE forum.

  Before I became Chairman, I had the 

pleasure of addressing the 5th annual forum as a member of the Board of Governors in 

2005.

  At that time, I spoke about the implementation of monetary policy and how 

crucial effective communication is to that implementation. 

Although I cannot join you in person this year, I note from the conference agenda 

that you are hearing from two Federal Reserve Bank presidents--Charles Evans of 

Chicago and Dennis Lockhart of Atlanta--as well as former Federal Reserve Board Vice 

Chairman Roger Ferguson.  Effective communication in monetary policy is more 

important than ever, and I have little doubt that my current and former colleagues will 

provide you with insights about the Federal Reserve’s ongoing efforts to achieve the 

goals that the Congress has given us:  maximum employment and price stability. 

In my brief remarks today, I would like to mention another important mission of 

the Federal Reserve--promoting economic and financial knowledge among people of all 

ages and walks of life.  The Board in Washington and the 12 Federal Reserve Banks 

throughout the country are all deeply involved in economic education and supporting the 

work of teachers, schools, and national organizations.  For example, the Federal Reserve 

provides a financial and economic education website with a variety of resources for

  The site offers 

educational games, classroom lesson plans, online publications, and multimedia 

tools.  Federal Reserve Banks offer professional development opportunities for teachers 

to improve their ability to present lessons on personal finance topics.  A number of 

Reserve Banks also organize personal finance essay, video, and academic competitions 

for students.  And we encourage students and teachers to visit Federal Reserve Bank 

learning centers and museums, which feature interactive exhibits about many aspects of 

banking, the financial system, and the economy.  

Among the lessons of the recent financial crisis is the need for virtually 

everyone--both young and old--to acquire a basic knowledge of finance and economics.  

Such knowledge is necessary for anyone who will be faced with managing a household 

budget, making financial investments, finding reliable information about buying a car or 

house, and preparing financially for retirement and other life goals.  Accordingly, in 

addition to ensuring that students graduate with the financial literacy skills they need to 

navigate in the modern financial world, we, as a society, must also make sure that adults 

have opportunities to gain these skills or to refresh what they have learned.  Many of you 

are, or will be, practitioners in the financial services industry--perhaps serving retail 

clients--and in that capacity I hope you will make the promotion of financial and 

economic education a part of your mission as well.  These skills not only help people 

provide a better life for themselves and their families, but, by deepening their 

understanding of the world economy, having such skills also helps equip them to be 

engaged citizens and informed voters.

Let me close by congratulating the University of Dayton for its leadership in 

hosting the RISE forum.  I hope this innovative program, which I’m told is the world’s 

largest student investment conference, succeeds in its ambitious goal of bringing together 

the current and future leaders of finance to focus on creating a better economic future.
