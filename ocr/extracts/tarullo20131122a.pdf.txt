Shadow Banking and Systemic Risk Regulation 


Remarks by

  As illustrated, quite literally, by a chart that New York Fed staff produced a few years 

ago, the term “shadow banking system” encompasses a wide variety of institutions that engage in 

credit intermediation and maturity transformation outside the insured depository system.1  In my 

remarks today, I want to concentrate on short-term wholesale funding and, especially, the pre-

crisis explosion in the creation of assets that were thought to be “cash equivalents.”  Such assets 

were held by a range of highly risk-averse investors, who were in many cases not fully cognizant 

that the “cash equivalents” in their portfolios were liabilities of shadow banks--the institutions 

depicted in the memorable graphic.   

In some cases, the perception of claims on shadow banks as cash equivalents was based 

on explicit or implicit promises by regulated institutions to provide liquidity and credit support to 

such entities.  In other cases, the perception came about because market participants viewed the 

instruments held on the balance sheets of shadow banking entities--notably highly rated, asset-

backed securities--as liquid and safe.  While reliance on private mechanisms to create seemingly 

riskless assets was sustainable in relatively calm years, the stress that marked the onset of the 

financial crisis reminded investors that claims on the shadow banking system could pose far 

more risk than deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).  Once 

reminded of their potential exposure, investors engaged in broad-based and sometimes disorderly 

flight from the shadow banking system.   

This experience of the run on the shadow banking system that occurred in 2007 and 2008 

reminds us that similar disorderly flights of uninsured deposits from banks lay at the heart of the 

financial panics that afflicted the nation in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.  The

most dramatic of these episodes were the bank runs of the early 1930s that culminated in the 

bank holiday in 1933.  Just as it was necessary, though not sufficient, to alter the environment 

that led to those successive deposit runs by introducing deposit insurance in order to create a 

stable financial system in the early-twentieth century, today it is necessary, though not sufficient, 

to alter the environment that can lead to short-term wholesale funding runs in order to create a 

stable financial system for the early twenty-first century. 

 As I will describe in a few moments, the Federal Reserve has taken some steps toward 

this end over the past few years.  However, as I will also contend, completion of this task will 

require a more comprehensive set of measures, at least some of which must cover financial 

actors not subject to prudential regulatory oversight.  Before turning to these points, I want to 

develop briefly the comparison between deposit runs of the pre-FDIC period and contemporary 

short-term wholesale funding runs in order better to explain the nature of the regulatory 

challenge.  

Vulnerabilities Created by Short-Term Wholesale Funding 

 There are notable similarities between the bank runs that periodically afflicted the U.S. 

banking system before the creation of federal deposit insurance and the dramatic short-term 

wholesale funding runs that began in 2007.  Each had a cascading, self-reinforcing quality, 

fueled by questions concerning the solvency of borrowing entities--whether deposit-taking banks 

or dealers seeking credit in repo markets.  And, in each case, the opaqueness of the balance 

sheets of the borrowing entities led lenders to fear that an institution holding assets similar to, or 

interconnected through counterparty relationships with, another, troubled institution might itself 

be in trouble.  Significantly, though, in each case, at least some of the lending actors were 

interested not just in eventually recovering the full amount of the funds they had extended, but in 


- 3 - 
 


having access to those funds more or less immediately.  Some depositors in 1932 needed their 

money in order to meet the requirements of daily life, while many repo counterparties in 2008 

needed their money to meet other short-term obligations.  Thus the issue was not just a matter of 

solvency--whether the firm would ultimately be able to pay all the claims even after the run--but 

also a matter of the short-term liquidity of the bank or broker.   

 The dynamic unleashed by short-term wholesale funding runs in 2007 and 2008 directly 

exacerbated financial stress.  Many assets funded through the shadow banking system were 

traded assets, which could be liquidated rapidly, though often at distressed prices, to reduce the 

funding needs of the borrowing firms.  The resulting fire sales recalled the asset liquidations by 

some trust companies during the Panic of 1907 and by some securities firms in the 1930s.  In 

2008, these fire sales created adverse feedback loops of mark-to-market losses, margin calls, and 

further liquidations.  The unwinding of the risk illusion--that is, the assumption that lending to 

shadow banks was essentially risk-free--helped transform a dramatic correction in real estate 

valuations into a crisis that engulfed the entire economy. 

  But for a few idiosyncratic instances since the introduction of deposit insurance in 1933, 

bank runs have been rendered a thing of the past.  Deposits below the amount of the federal 

insurance cap are fully and explicitly guaranteed.  Access to the Federal Reserve’s discount 

window for depository institutions complements the deposit insurance system by helping to 

relieve liquidity pressures in solvent banks.  In practice, failing banks usually merge into 

healthier ones, so that depositors do not lose access to their funds and deposits exceeding the 

amount of the federal insurance cap are effectively protected.  In the relatively few instances of 

depositor payouts, the FDIC has reimbursed depositors expeditiously.  Of course, the explicit and 


- 4 - 
 


de facto extension of federal guarantees created moral hazard problems, which the safety-and-

soundness regulation of insured depository institutions was strengthened to address. 

  The similarities between deposit runs and short-term wholesale funding runs have 

suggested to some that the policy responses should also be similar.  Those taking this position 

argue for providing discount window access to broker-dealers, guaranteeing certain kinds of 

wholesale funding, or both.  Others, myself included, are wary of any such extension of the 

government safety net and would prefer a regulatory approach that requires market actors using 

or extending short-term wholesale funding to internalize the social costs of those forms of 

funding.  Unlike deposit insurance, the savings of most U.S. households are generally not 

directly at risk in short-term wholesale funding arrangements.  And, also unlike insured deposits, 

there is an argument in the short-term wholesale funding context that counterparties should be 

capable of providing some market discipline in at least some of the contexts in which such 

funding is provided. 

In thinking about how to regulate shadow banking, we must be mindful that it is not 

really a single system.  It is immeasurably more complicated than the bank deposit system of 

either the 1930s or today.  Even with the reduction in activity following the crisis, the scale of 

shadow banking activity remains very large.  Banks and broker-dealers currently borrow about 

$1.6 trillion, much of this from money market funds and securities lenders, through tri-party 

repos, leaving aside additional funds sourced from asset managers and other investors through 

other channels.2  The banks and broker dealers, in turn, use reverse repo to provide more than $1 

trillion in financing to prime brokerage and other clients.  While the volume of this activity has

fallen considerably since the crisis and the haircuts and other conditions associated with current 

securities financing transactions are considerably more conservative than during the pre-crisis 

period, there is every reason to believe that the amount of this activity could increase, and the 

conservatism of the terms of the lending could be eroded, as economic conditions improve. 

 Let me turn now to some of the specific vulnerabilities, steps that have been taken thus 

far to address these vulnerabilities, and the work that remains. 

Regulated Institutions and Shadow Banking 

While the term “shadow banking” implies activity outside the purview of regulatory 

oversight, regulated institutions are in fact heavily involved in these activities, both in funding 

their own operations and in extending credit and liquidity support to shadow banks beyond the 

regulatory perimeter.    

Support provided for shadow banking activities may be either explicit or implicit.  In 

some cases, there are explicit contractual provisions for credit enhancements and liquidity 

support.  In other cases, the support is implicit, based on a bank’s historical pattern of providing 

support or a belief among investors that a bank will provide support to maintain the value of its 

franchise.  In the lead-up to the crisis, explicit and implicit commitments by regulated banking 

firms to shadow banks often combined to create the assumption that the liabilities of such entities 

were risk-free.  This perception led to an underpricing of the risks embedded in these money-like 

instruments, making them an artificially cheap source of funding and creating an oversupply of 

these instruments that contributed to systemic risk.  

Contractually committed credit and liquidity support lends itself more readily to 

regulation than does implicit support.  Basel III reforms have strengthened the regulatory 

requirements for situations in which there is contractual support for shadow banking activities.  


- 6 - 
 


For example, the Basel III capital requirements increase from 0 percent to 20 percent the credit 

conversion factor for commitments with an original maturity of one year or less that are not 

unconditionally cancellable.  In addition, the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) assigns a 

100 percent drawdown rate to undrawn amounts of credit and liquidity facilities extended by 

banks to a special purpose entity (SPE), effectively requiring a bank to hold $100 in high-quality 

liquid assets (HQLA) for every $100 it commits to a SPE. 

Implicit support presents more of a regulatory challenge.  Identifying implicit forms of 

support requires a supervisory judgment that, despite sometimes stern warnings in offering 

documents, a banking organization bears some of the risk associated with that investment.  

Regulators must decide how much of the risk the banking organization retains and make context-

sensitive judgments about the financial stability implications of various remedies.  These 

challenges notwithstanding, regulators have made some progress in addressing instances of 

implicit support that played a major role in the last crisis.  Let me mention two examples. 

The first involves the implicit support associated with the provision of intraday credit by 

clearing banks in the tri-party repo market.  In a repurchase agreement or “repo,” the cash 

borrower agrees to sell a security to a cash lender, and to repurchase the security from the cash 

lender at a later date.  In a tri-party repo transaction, a clearing bank handles settlements through 

accounts held at that financial institution by the parties to the transaction.  To allow broker-

dealers who borrow in the tri-party repo market to have access to their securities for routine 

trading purposes, the market developed an operational feature known as the “daily unwind.”  

Before the crisis and for some time afterwards, the clearing banks unwound all tri-party repo 

trades each day--even those with a significant term, which in theory represented longer-term 

financing commitments--returning securities to borrowers and cash to lenders.  However, 


- 7 - 
 


because the securities still required financing during the day, cash borrowers relied on 

uncommitted secured credit, backed by their overall portfolio of securities and provided by the 

clearing bank.  Transactions were re-wound at the end of the day, with specific securities 

allocated as collateral to each lender at that time.    

Cash lenders in the tri-party repo market thus came to expect that the two clearing banks 

would always unwind their maturing trades in the morning, returning cash to their account, 

despite the absence of a contractual provision requiring them to do so.  As a result, they grew 

comfortable in the belief that they held a cash-equivalent asset that was perfectly safe and liquid.  

But as the crisis deepened, cash lenders became aware of the fact that the clearing banks were 

not contractually obligated to unwind repo trades and that the dealers that were the primary 

borrowers in the tri-party repo market could fail, leaving lenders with collateral that they had 

little or no capacity to manage at a juncture when its value and liquidity was open to doubt.  This 

resulted in several distinct episodes during the crisis when cash lenders, despite holding 

collateral, quickly withdrew financing from dealers perceived to be facing potential financial 

distress.  The tri-party repo market might have suffered a full-scale run in the absence of public-

sector intervention. 

Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has led an effort to reduce reliance on intraday credit 

in the tri-party repo market.  Work to date has reduced the amount of intraday credit provided by 

the clearing banks from 100 percent of the tri-party repo market to approximately 30 percent, and 

commitments by market participants suggest that this amount will fall to 10 percent by the end of 

next year.  This operational change, in addition to enhancing the resiliency of the settlement 

process, should help limit the likelihood that tri-party repo lenders return to believing that 

lending in the tri-party repo market is a risk-free proposition.  As a result, tri-party repo lenders 


- 8 - 
 


are likely to conduct more thorough due diligence on their counterparties and exercise more care 

in considering the types of collateral that they will lend against than was the case before the 

crisis.3  

The second example involves the implicit support provided by bank sponsors of certain 

securitization SPEs.  Before the crisis, the interplay between bank capital requirements and 

accounting rules created a significant incentive for banks to shift assets off-balance sheet through 

the use of various SPEs.  Under the capital requirements that applied at the time, a bank that sold 

assets to a conduit or other SPE it sponsored was required to hold capital only against its 

contractual exposure to the SPE.  Yet because a bank that failed to support SPEs it sponsored 

might irreparably damage the value of its franchise, banks often provided credit and liquidity 

support in excess of contractually obligated amounts to asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 

programs, credit card securitizations, and other structured finance vehicles.  Recognizing this 

incentive, pre-crisis lenders were willing to hold commercial paper and other liabilities issued by 

bank-sponsored SPEs at yields only slightly higher than those on liabilities issued directly by the 

bank.  In effect, the bank was able to hold less capital and reduce its funding costs without 

decreasing its economic exposure.  

Post-crisis reforms have reduced the opportunity for banks to exploit this regulatory 

arbitrage.  In 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) adopted FAS 166 and 167 

to modify the accounting treatment of structured finance transactions involving certain SPEs.  

Under the new accounting guidance, a company is required to consolidate those SPEs for which 

the company has the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the entity as well as 

the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits.  Securitization sponsors have

generally interpreted the new guidance as requiring a sponsor to consolidate a SPE under 

circumstances in which the sponsor retains loan-servicing obligations and exposure to the equity 

tranche of the securitization.   

Following the publication of FAS 166 and 167, the federal banking agencies adopted new 

rules requiring banking organizations to hold risk-based and leverage capital against assets of the 

newly consolidated SPEs.4  These rules eliminated a provision in the bank capital requirements 

that permitted a banking organization to exclude from the calculation of its risk-weighted assets 

the assets of an ABCP program that the banking organization sponsored and was required to 

consolidate.  As a result, bank sponsors of ABCP conduits and certain other securitizations must 

now hold levels of regulatory capital commensurate with the exposure arising from the implicit 

support they provide.  

Collateralized Borrowing Arrangements and Financial Stability  

 Turning now to financial stability concerns raised by short-term wholesale funding more 

generally, I want to focus on collateralized borrowing arrangements.  These collateralized 

borrowing arrangements consist largely of securities financing transactions (SFTs), a term that 

generally refers to repo and reverse repo, securities lending and borrowing, and securities margin 

lending.  Lenders are willing to extend credit on a secured basis because these transactions are 

usually short-term, over-collateralized, backed by reasonably liquid securities, subject to daily 

mark-to-market and re-margining requirements, and exempt from the automatic stay in 

insolvency proceedings.  In the most common practice, a broker-dealer uses SFTs to finance

Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Thrift Supervision (2010), “Agencies Issue Final Rule for Regulatory

either securities inventory or a back-to-back SFT loan to another financial firm (SFT matched 

book).   

 The financial stability risks associated with a dealer’s use of short-term SFT funding to 

finance its inventory are relatively straightforward.  If a broker-dealer loses access to financing 

and is forced to sell securities at a depressed price, fire sale externalities may result because other 

market participants may be less able to borrow against the same securities.  And if the broker-

dealer fails due to runs by short-term SFT lenders, post-default fire sales by the firm’s creditors 

or contagious runs on other financial intermediaries may ensue.  Because broker-dealers 

generally do not internalize the externalities that arise in these cases, they may use more than the 

economically efficient level of short-term funding.   

 The financial stability risks associated with SFT matched books are somewhat less 

obvious.  Even if the outflows and inflows associated with a dealer’s SFT positions are perfectly 

maturity-matched, reputational considerations may inhibit a dealer from reducing the amount of 

SFT credit that it provides its customers, exposing the dealer to considerable liquidity stress.  If 

the dealer does reduce the amount of credit that it provides to its customers, those customers may 

be forced to engage in asset fire sales of their own.  Particularly in situations in which the 

customers are highly leveraged, maturity-transforming entities that lack access to a liquidity 

provider of last resort may pose a significant risk of contagion. 

 Post-crisis financial regulatory reform has taken some steps to address the financial 

stability risks associated with a dealer’s use of short-term SFT funding to finance inventory.  For 

example, the liquidity coverage ratio requires firms to hold a buffer of high-quality liquid assets 

when they use SFT liabilities that mature in less than 30 days to fund many types of securities.  

New risk-based capital rules have substantially increased the amount of capital that dealers are 


- 11 - 
 


required to hold against assets in the trading book.  But these reforms are limited: The LCR does 

not require firms to hold any liquidity buffer against SFT liabilities that mature in more than 30 

days or that are backed by very liquid assets.  There continues to be a need for standardized 

capital requirements for market risk to back up model-derived risk weights.   

 Moreover, the current regulatory framework does not impose any meaningful regulatory 

charge on the financial stability risks associated with SFT matched books.  The Basel III risk-

based capital rules require banking organizations to hold relatively little capital against SFT 

assets, which are assumed to pose little microprudential risk.  Because leverage requirements do 

not take into account the fact that SFTs are collateralized transactions, leverage requirements 

have the potential to impose higher charges on SFT assets.  But leverage requirements have 

traditionally been calibrated at non-binding levels and, to the extent they do bind in the future, 

are unlikely to bind evenly across firms.  As a result, the leverage ratio may simply cause SFT 

assets and liabilities to migrate to those firms with stronger leverage ratios.  

 Similarly, the LCR and, at least at this stage of its development, the Net Stable Funding 

Ratio (NSFR), both assume that a firm with a perfectly matched book is in a stable position.  The 

LCR assumes a bank can call in reverse repos and other SFT assets that mature in less than 30 

days or reuse the collateral that secures those assets for purposes of its own borrowing.  Thus, 

reverse repos and other SFT assets generally are treated as completely liquid instruments.  Under 

the initial version of the NSFR, firms would not need to hold any stable funding against reverse 

repos, securities borrowing receivables, or other loans to financial entities that mature in less 

than one year.  Again, this may be a reasonable position from a microprudential perspective, 

geared toward more or less normal times.  But here is where we need an explicitly 


- 12 - 
 


macroprudential perspective that forces firms to internalize the tail-event financial stability risks 

associated with SFT matched books.   

Policy Options 

There are two kinds of policy options that can be considered, individually or together, in 

responding to the financial stability vulnerabilities inherent in firms with large amounts of short-

term wholesale funding--whether loaned, borrowed, or both.  The first would impose a 

regulatory charge calculated by reference to reliance on SFTs and other forms of short-term 

wholesale funding, whether the firm uses that funding to finance inventory or an SFT matched 

book.  The second would directly increase the very low charges under current and pending 

regulatory standards attracted by SFT matched books. 

 Among the first set of options, the idea that seems most promising is to tie capital and 

liquidity standards together by requiring higher levels of capital for large firms that substantially 

rely on short-term wholesale funding.  The additional capital requirement would be calculated by 

reference to a definition of short-term wholesale funding, such as total liabilities minus 

regulatory capital, insured deposits, and obligations with a remaining maturity of greater than a 

specified term.  There might be a kind of weighting system to take account of the specific risk 

characteristics of different forms of funding.  The capital requirement would then be added to the 

Tier 1 common equity requirement already mandated by the minimum capital, capital 

conservation buffer, and globally systemic bank surcharge standards.  However, this component 

of the Tier 1 common equity requirement would be calculated by reference to the liability side, 

rather than the asset side, of the firm’s balance sheet. 

The rationale behind this policy option is that, while solid requirements are needed for 

both capital and liquidity, the relationship between the two also matters.  For example, a firm 


- 13 - 
 


with little reliance on short-term funding is less susceptible to runs and, thus, to the need for 

engaging in fire sales that can depress capital levels.  A capital surcharge based on short-term 

wholesale funding usage would add an incentive to use more stable funding and, where a firm 

concluded that higher levels of such funding were nonetheless economically sensible, the 

surcharge would increase the loss absorbency of the firm.  Such a requirement would be 

consistent with, though distinct from, the long-term debt requirement that the Federal Reserve 

Board will be proposing to enhance prospects for resolving large firms without taxpayer 

assistance. 

The second kind of policy option is to address head-on the macroprudential concerns 

arising from large matched books of securities financing transactions.  A capital surcharge is in 

some respects an indirect response to the problem of short-term wholesale funding runs and, as 

earlier noted, current versions of capital and liquidity standards do not deal with matched book 

issues.  One might choose either to increase capital charges applicable to SFT assets or to modify 

liquidity standards so as to require firms with large amounts of these assets to hold larger 

liquidity buffers or to maintain more stable funding structures.  It is not clear how much appetite 

there may be internationally for revisiting agreements that have been completed, such as the 

LCR and the Basel III capital rules.  However, with the NSFR still under discussion, and with the 

Basel Committee in the process of reconsidering the standardized banking book risk weights and 

capital regulations associated with traded assets, there are opportunities to pursue these options. 

Requirements building on any of the foregoing options would by definition be directly 

applicable only to firms already within the perimeter of prudential regulation.  The obvious 

questions are whether these firms at present occupy enough of the market that standards 

applicable only to them would be reasonably effective in addressing systemic risk and, even if 


- 14 - 
 


that question is answered affirmatively, whether the imposition of such standards would lead to a 

significant arbitrage through increased participation by those outside the regulatory perimeter.  It 

does not seem far-fetched to think that, with time and sufficient economic incentive, the 

financial, technological, and regulatory barriers to the disintermediation of prudentially regulated 

dealers could be overcome.  Indeed, there have already been reports of some hedge funds 

exploring the possibility of disintermediating dealers by lending cash against securities collateral 

to other market participants. 

 For this reason, there is a need to supplement prudential bank regulation with a third set 

of policy options in the form of regulatory tools that can be applied on a market-wide basis.  That 

is, regulation would focus on particular kinds of transactions, rather than just the nature of the 

firm engaging in the transactions.  To date, over-the-counter derivatives reform is the primary 

example of a post-crisis effort at market-wide regulation.5  Given that the 2007–2008 financial 

crisis was driven more by disruptions in the SFT markets than by disruptions in the over-the-

counter derivative markets, comparable attention to SFT markets is surely needed.  Over the past 

two years, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has been evaluating proposals for a system of 

haircuts and margin requirements for SFTs.  In its broadest form, a system of numerical floors 

for SFT haircuts would require any entity that wants to borrow against any security to post a 

minimum amount of excess margin that would vary depending on the asset class of the collateral.  

Like minimum margin requirements for derivatives, numerical floors for SFT haircuts would be 

                                                            
5 Although the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission primary responsibility in this area, a broad range of federal financial regulators (including the Federal 
Reserve) is responsible for developing margin requirements for over-the-counter derivatives transactions.  These 
requirements will limit the amount of leverage that market participants can take on through the use of derivative 
instruments.  In addition, by requiring margin to be posted at the outset of a transaction and mark-to-market gains 
and losses to be continually offset through transfers of additional collateral, these requirements will help to avoid 
situations in which firms face margin calls only when they are most pressed for liquidity. 


- 15 - 
 


intended to serve as a mechanism for limiting the build up of leverage at the security level, and 

could mitigate the risk of procyclical margin calls.   

 In August, the FSB released a proposal that would represent a first step in the direction of 

such a framework.  However the FSB’s proposal has some significant limitations.  First, with 

respect to counterparty scope, the FSB’s proposal would apply only to SFTs in which regulated 

entities provide financing to unregulated entities; the proposal would not cover SFTs between a 

regulated lender and a regulated borrower, between an unregulated lender and a regulated 

borrower, or between an unregulated lender and an unregulated borrower.  Second, the proposal 

would apply only to lending against collateral other than sovereign obligations.  And finally, 

with respect to calibration, the FSB’s proposed numerical floors are set at relatively low levels--

levels that are, for example, significantly below the haircuts that currently prevail in the tri-party 

repo market.   

 An alternative to the FSB’s proposal would be to apply a system of numerical floors to 

SFTs regardless of the identity of the parties to the transaction.  Such an approach would at least 

partially offset the incentive that will otherwise exist to move more securities financing activity 

completely into the shadows.  Regarding calibration, there are at least three conceptually 

plausible bases for setting the level of the numerical floors above the low backstop levels 

contemplated in the current FSB proposal.   

One approach would be to base the calibration of the numerical floors on current repo 

market haircuts.  These haircuts have increased significantly compared to pre-crisis levels.  

Establishing numerical floors at around current levels could prevent the return of a less prudent 

set of practices as memories of the crisis fade.  A second approach would be to set haircuts for a 

given asset class based on asset price volatility or haircut levels observed during times of stress 


- 16 - 
 


or long-term periods that include times of stress.  While minimum haircut levels should not be 

set as high as the haircuts lenders demanded at the depths of the crisis, setting numerical floors in 

proportion to those levels might be reasonable.  A third alternative would be to set numerical 

floors for SFT haircuts at levels that are commensurate with the amount of capital a banking 

organization would need to hold against the security if it held the security in inventory.  Such an 

approach could be viewed as an indirect way of extending bank capital requirements to the 

shadow banking system, and would reduce the current bank regulatory incentive to lend against a 

security rather than hold it directly.  

 Finally, it is worth noting that, while a framework of universal margin requirements for 

SFTs could not be evaded through the disintermediation of regulated entities, it might be evaded 

through the use of alternative transactional structures.  If margin requirements for cash SFT 

transactions are significantly higher than margin requirements for creating the same economic 

exposures using synthetic SFT transactions, a framework of minimum margins for SFTs could 

push market participants to rely more heavily on derivatives that are the functional equivalent of 

cash SFTs.  Moreover, market participants might attempt to arbitrage margin floors through 

arrangements whereby the lender effectively lends the SFT borrower the minimum excess 

margin amount.  These and similar issues will need to be addressed as options for minimum 

margins are further developed. 

Conclusion 

 If we think back to the rapid growth of the shadow banking system in the pre-crisis 

period, we are reminded of some glaring vulnerabilities:  Large firms that could themselves be 

considered shadow banks and that relied on the shadow banking system for a significant 

proportion of their funding--a group that included the “free-standing” investment banks--were 


- 17 - 
 


outside the perimeter of prudential regulation.  The breaking of the buck by the Reserve Primary 

Fund following Lehman’s collapse triggered a run on the shadow banking system that required 

unprecedented support by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve.   

 The process established by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection 

Act for designation of systemically important non-bank firms has provided a means for ensuring 

that the perimeter of prudential regulation can be extended as appropriate to cover large shadow 

banking institutions.  The proposals of the Securities and Exchange Commission on money 

market fund regulation are a response to continuing vulnerabilities as well as to the run in the fall 

of 2008.  These are important initiatives that will contribute to a safer system of funding 

throughout the financial system.  Yet the risk of contagious runs would persist even in the 

absence of individually systemic institutions.  And with less vulnerable money market funds, 

other cash-rich entities could emerge as a source of inexpensive funding for the shadow banking 

system.  Finally, as I have noted, the systemic risks associated with short-term wholesale funding 

in prudentially regulated institutions have not fully been countered by the important capital and 

liquidity standards adopted since the crisis.  My purpose today has been to reinforce the point 

that a sounder, more stable financial system requires a more comprehensive reform agenda.
