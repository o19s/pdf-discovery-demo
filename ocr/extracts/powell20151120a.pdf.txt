It’s been a month since the New York Fed hosted a very successful 

conference on Treasury market structure, and I’m eager to continue the 

conversation started there.  I thought I’d start by discussing some of the main 

points I took from the conference.  There were certainly different points of view on 

a variety of issues between broker dealers, proprietary trading firms (PTFs), end 

users and others, but hearing a range of views was exactly the dynamic we were 

hoping for.   

There was broad understanding that electronic and automated trading are 

here to stay.  Indeed, a wide range of firms are engaged in these trading practices 

today.  Participants on the PTF panel viewed their relative speed and efficiency as 

allowing them to provide tighter spreads and greater liquidity.  One expressed the 

belief that his firm needed to be faster and more sophisticated because, unlike 

broker-dealers, they have no direct view of customer order flows.  For their part, 

dealers noted that they provide a key service in helping their customers execute 

larger trades, and defended their internal matching of customer trades as a natural 

search for trading efficiencies.  

There were differing views on the significance of what happened in Treasury 

markets on October 15, 2014.  Many attendees voiced concern, but a number also 

expressed the view that the market worked as it was supposed to, and even that

nothing extraordinary occurred that day.  Although buy-side participants tended to 

believe that they were not directly affected given the short duration of the price 

swings that day, some noted that more frequent episodes of high volatility could 

lead them to demand larger risk premiums.   

For my part, I do realize that a single 12-minute roundtrip episode may not 

mean that much in the end.  But it isn’t satisfying to me to say that the market 

worked as it was intended to.  The events of October 15 were unusual both in the 

size and speed of the moves and in the absence of a fundamental driver.  The real 

question is whether there are dynamics at play here that are likely to produce more 

episodes of sudden, outsized volatility without any obvious cause.  Further 

episodes of this nature could cause more market participants to react in ways that 

reduce liquidity, and add to pressures for changes in market structure.   

There were also areas of consensus.  First, there was a general desire for 

more publicly available market data, particularly in the dealer-to-customer 

segment.  It is striking that there is so little information on trading in this segment 

of our nation’s Treasury market.  The staff who worked on the October 15 report 

did a great job, but it took a mammoth effort on their part to gather detailed trade 

data for just that single day.  As Antonio Weiss will discuss today, the agencies 

involved in the Joint Staff Report on October 15 are assessing the adequacy of

publicly available information, and of the data available to the official sector for its 

own monitoring of these markets.1 

A number of participants also expressed interest in continuing to try out a 

range of potential innovations to current market structures.  Presenters at the 

academic sessions of the conference argued that the combination of a central limit 

order book and high speed trading can lead to higher liquidity risk and a race for 

speed.  In the current structure, customer trades occur mainly off of public markets, 

except at times of market stress when dealers may be unable or unwilling to 

internalize them.  That approach does not seem likely to provide good, stable 

liquidity in changing market conditions.  One presenter at the conference outlined 

his idea that high frequency “batch auctions” -- auctions held every millisecond or 

so rather than trading continuously -- would increase market liquidity and limit the 

race for speed.  There are several related ideas that have been proposed.  In fact, 

trading platforms have already tried various innovations.  For example, EBS has 

instituted latency floors and random batching lengths for messaging in its FX 

trading platform.  I hope we will hear more about that today.     

There may be other adaptations to the current market structure that could 

provide greater or more stable liquidity.  A good way to find out if there are better

solutions would be to try some of these ideas, at least on a small scale.  Regulators 

are not necessarily well placed to dictate specific trading structures.  I’d much 

rather see changes emerge from a process of experimentation and seeing what 

works.  We should have strong evidence that any change in structure represents an 

improvement before implementing it on a wide scale.    

But we will only be able to evaluate structural innovations if traders actually 

use them.  And the market would need to include both dealers and PTFs.  I’d be 

interested in hearing the panelists’ views on this and whether there are things that 

regulators could do to encourage a cooperative, industry-wide approach.   

Treasury repo markets are also undergoing structural changes, which brings 

me to the third area of consensus at the conference.  The repo panel I moderated 

included an asset manager, a broker dealer and one of the triparty clearing banks.  

There was agreement on the panel that expanded repo clearing would be positive 

for the market.  That said, there was also a consensus that the current private sector 

initiatives in this area face demanding regulatory requirements related to capital 

and liquidity.  We are carefully considering these proposals and are open to 

solutions that would satisfy regulatory requirements while bringing the benefits of 

central clearing.  I’d welcome panelists’ views on proposals for expanded repo 

clearing as well.

I look forward to the conversations today, and I hope we’ll keep having 

them.  Treasury markets are important to all of us.  The financial market 

participants represented here have special reasons to care.  As one of the panelists 

at the conference put it, we’ve built our entire prudential regulatory framework, 

indeed our entire financial framework, around the ability to quickly and efficiently 

transform Treasury securities in to cash liquidity.  These markets need to keep 

functioning at a high level, and we all have a stake in making sure that they do.
