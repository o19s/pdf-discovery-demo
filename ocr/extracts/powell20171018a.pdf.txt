41st Annual Central Banking Seminar, sponsored by

October 18, 2017 





We live in a world defined by the rapid pace of technological change.  Four of the 

five largest U.S. companies by market capitalization are classified as “technology 

companies,” where the term describes the products that these companies sell and how 

they operate.  Thanks to decades of investment in information technology, especially in 

electronic communication networks, consumers now expect services to be available 

instantly at their fingertips.  This statement is true for almost every industry and every 

aspect of daily life, including financial transactions. 

This evening, I will consider how technology is changing the delivery of retail 

banking and payments services.  I will discuss the roles of banks, fintech companies, and 

other stakeholders in moving the United States forward to a better payment system.  I will 

also review the Federal Reserve’s collaboration with these payment system stakeholders 

in pursuing that goal.  I will argue that, for policymakers as well as the private sector, the 

challenge is to embrace technology as a means of improving convenience and speed in 

the delivery of financial services, while also assuring the security and privacy necessary 

to sustain the public’s trust.    As always, the views I express here are my own.    

Retail Banking Innovation 

As with so many sectors of the economy, technology is transforming the retail 

banking sector.  The banking industry has traditionally been characterized by physical 

branches, privileged access to financial data, and distinct expertise in analyzing such 

data.1  But in today’s world companies need not be bound by physical infrastructure and 

related overhead expenses.  For example, companies can take advantage of an explosion

Noise around Financial Technology,” McKinsey & Company, February, 2016,

in available data, and leverage advances in computing power, via cloud computing, 

analytical tools, and off-the-shelf machine learning tools, to make sense of those data.  

The banking industry is adjusting to this world, and facing significant challenges to 

traditional banking business models.  

For example, today financial technology can support access to credit through 

innovative approaches to gathering and analyzing data.  Historically, a customer seeking 

a loan has provided financial statements to a bank or other traditional lending institution.  

More recently, the use of a fintech platform may allow a lender to quickly monitor and 

analyze more up-to-date data from a broader range of sources, including those outside of 

the traditional lending process, to verify an applicant’s identity and make inferences 

about the applicant’s overall financial health.  For example, a business loan applicant 

could submit information such as shipping data or customer reviews as additional input to 

more traditional data sources.  With this additional information, the bank would have a 

more complete picture of an applicant’s day-to-day activity and overall financial 

capacity, and potentially a greater ability to provide credit to customers, including some 

who might have been otherwise denied a loan based on traditional data.  

Fintech firms are also finding ways to use banks’ data, in some cases without 

entering into an explicit partnership with the bank.  With customers’ permission, fintech 

firms have increasingly turned to data aggregators to “screen scrape” information from 

financial accounts.  In such cases, data aggregators collect and store online banking 

logins and passwords provided by the bank’s customers and use them to log directly into 

the customer’s banking account.  This information can be used to provide consumers with

convenient real-time snapshots of their financial information across multiple banks and 

accounts.  

These examples highlight that there is a balance that needs to be achieved in this 

innovative environment.2  On the one hand, new technologies have enabled banks and 

other firms to find different ways of meeting consumers’ demand for speed and 

convenience.  On the other hand, these same technologies raise new considerations about 

data security and safety, as well as consumer privacy and protection.  Policymakers and 

the financial industry must assure that enhanced convenience and speed in financial 

services do not undermine the safety, security, and reliability of those services.   

Retail Payments Innovation 

Technology is also shaping changes in retail payments.  As with retail banking, 

retail payments will need to evolve to meet consumer expectations of constant 

connectivity and instant access while assuring security and privacy.  

It is not news that consumers’ lives, including the way they pay, are now 

intertwined with mobile phone usage.  While the overall amount of time we spend on our 

phones continues to grow, the duration of individual phone sessions is actually shrinking.  

In late 2015, Google estimated that the average mobile session lasts only 70 seconds, and 

may be repeated dozens of times per day.3  As a result, payment innovators have had to 

create new ways to move money that are not only fast and mobile-focused, but also

sufficiently “frictionless” that consumers can now fit commerce into these brief 

interludes.  

This development has ushered in a world of multiple smartphone apps that allow 

for “instant” payments.  We can use a payments app to move funds instantly to anyone 

who has that app.4  Some banks have similarly collaborated to build faster payments 

applications that leverage their deposit account systems.  And we are already moving to a 

world in which we need not open a special app or go to our bank’s website in order to 

send money.  Many people here will have taken an Uber or Lyft, and then paid your 

driver without relaunching the app, much less reaching for your wallet.  Similarly, 

payment providers can now leverage the application programming interfaces (APIs)—

essentially the protocols—of smartphone messaging services to integrate their payment 

tools directly into messaging applications: Nowadays, consumers can simply “attach” 

money while messaging a friend.  

Innovation in retail payments can also offer tangible benefits to consumers 

beyond convenience.  Improvements in security, such as our ability to authenticate 

consumers and detect fraudulent transactions, are also possible through innovation.  For 

instance, mobile payments introduce a wide array of ways to authenticate a consumer’s 

identity, including  two-factor authentication codes sent via text message to the phone; 

biometrics, like a fingerprint or face scan; device identification information; IP address; 

and geolocation data.  Similarly, increased access to transaction data and cloud 

computing resources means that we have smarter, faster computational processes—like 

enhanced neural networks—to detect payments that do not match a consumer’s spending

patterns and help prevent fraudulent transactions.  Both security and convenience are 

crucial elements for successful payments innovation.  Consumers will not store their 

funds in a system that is not secure and will not want to transfer funds out of an otherwise 

secure system if the process is cumbersome.  

The Role of Banks in Payments Innovation 

The examples I have highlighted so far illustrate payments innovations from 

fintech firms and banks alike.  I want to spend a moment highlighting the special role of 

banks in the payments process, and how banks are needed in order to create innovations 

that can be used broadly across the economy.  

The traditional role of banks in the payments process has been to hold deposits 

and enable their transfer from one individual or business to another.  A depositor might 

withdraw cash from the bank’s ATM to pay a friend or write a check to make a payment.  

Over time, we have moved from ATMs and paper checks toward electronic payments and 

online payments through banking platforms—payment methods for which banks are still 

perceived as essential.  More recently, consumer-facing technology has become front and 

center.  At times, the payments process is so seamlessly integrated that one can forget 

that there is even a bank in the process, as with the Uber and Lyft example.  But despite 

this shift in focus, payments innovation is still fundamentally about how, when, and 

where an individual’s deposits can be held, transferred, and packaged with other 

information.  And banks are still important players in making that happen.  Even where 

this reality is obscured by several layers of technology, there is almost always a bank 

involved in consumer transactions.

Given their importance in holding and transferring funds, banks continue to have 

a key role to play in the design and safety of more efficient retail payment systems.  

Without bank participation, it would be difficult to change how funds are transferred in a 

way that brings pervasive benefits to consumers.  For example, if the aim is to capture the 

speed and continuous nature of today’s commerce in the payment system as a whole—as 

has become a focus for many countries, including the United States—it would be difficult 

to do so without banks allowing the transfer of their deposits on a 24x7 real-time basis.  

Of course, individual payment systems are already doing this for consumers within their 

own network.  But achieving these benefits on a broad scale would be challenging 

without the banking system’s participation, because of the large role banks have in 

holding and transferring funds. 

All this is to say that we are at a critical juncture in the payment system’s 

evolution, where technology is rapidly changing many facets of the payments process.  

Fintech firms and banks are seizing these technological changes in their own ways.  But a 

collective and collaborative effort by all payment stakeholders will also be important as 

the United States works to achieve a payment system that has broad reach and can 

seamlessly integrate with other systems to transfer funds in a reliable, secure, and 

convenient manner.  When we pay with cash or write a check, we don’t spend a lot of 

time worrying about who our recipient banks with; that universality seems an appropriate 

standard for new payment options as well. 

Strategies for Improving the U.S. Payment System 

At the Federal Reserve, we believe it is important to embrace opportunities 

provided by technological change to improve the convenience and safety of the U.S.

payment system.  About five years ago, we launched our payment system improvement 

initiative, which committed the Federal Reserve to working with the full range of 

payments system stakeholders to achieve a faster, more secure payment system.  We saw 

that technology was transforming the nature of commerce and end-user expectations for 

payment services.  We saw some players coming to market with innovative product 

offerings, but it was a fragmented approach.  Meanwhile, other countries were advancing 

on initiatives to improve the speed and safety of their payment systems, creating a gap 

between the U.S. payment system and those abroad.   

While the Federal Reserve does not have plenary authority over payment systems, 

as is the case in some other countries, we have often played an important role as a leader 

and catalyst for change.  It was in this role that we issued a call to action asking 

stakeholders to come together in pursuit of a better payment system for the future—

focusing on speed, security, efficiency, international payments, and collaboration.5  I 

believe a collaborative approach ensures that change is designed by those whose 

commitment and expertise are needed to improve the payment system. 

Stakeholders – including banks, fintech companies, consumer groups, regulators, 

and others -- answered our call to action, signing up for two task forces convened by the 

Federal Reserve.  More than 300 stakeholders joined the Faster Payments Task Force, 

and around 200 joined the Secure Payments Task Force.  Let me first touch upon the 

Faster Payments Task Force, which has recently completed its work.6

Call to Action,” https://fasterpaymentstaskforce.org/.

The Faster Payments Task Force’s mission was to identify and assess alternative 

approaches for implementing a safe, ubiquitous, faster payments system in the United 

States.  The task force began its work by developing a set of effectiveness criteria laying 

out desirable attributes for faster payment solutions covering the broad categories of 

ubiquity, efficiency, safety and security, speed, legal framework, and governance.  While 

the task force was focused on improving speed and convenience, it also underscored the 

importance of safety and security by establishing 11 criteria of a total of 36 focused on 

those objectives.   

The task force encouraged its members to submit proposals for faster payment 

solutions that would meet the criteria that its members had agreed upon.  A diverse range 

of task force members rose to the challenge by submitting 16 proposals to be vetted 

against its criteria.7  These proposals represent a broad universe of creative and 

innovative ways to deliver faster payments by embracing technology.  They range in 

structure from solutions that use a centralized clearing and settlement mechanism to 

others that focus on distributed networks.  Some are based on traditional assets held in 

transaction accounts, and others depend on new asset forms like digital currencies.  The 

role of the task force process was not to recommend or implement a faster payment 

solution, but rather to offer a range of ideas to move the United States further along the 

path to a better payment system.  We believe that the task force has successfully carried 

out this role.  

                                                 
7 The task force recommended establishing an external Qualified Independent Assessment Team to conduct 

objective proposal assessments. On behalf of the task force, the Federal Reserve selected McKinsey & 

Company to conduct a comprehensive assessment of each faster payment solution proposal against the task 

force’s set of criteria.

We are very grateful to the members of the Faster Payment Task Force for all of 

their work and for the collaborative spirit they brought to the job.  But there is more to be 

done to advance our collective vision of a ubiquitous, real-time, secure future payment 

system.  Last month, the Federal Reserve reaffirmed its commitment to that vision in the 

paper, “Federal Reserve Next Steps in the Payments Improvement Journey,” which 

outlines refreshed strategies and tactics that we, in collaboration with the payment 

industry, will employ to make further progress. 8  I will mention just a few. 

One of the recommendations from the Faster Payments Task Force work was to 

establish an industry governance framework for collaboration and decision-making on 

faster payments.  To move forward in creating this framework, the task force established 

the Governance Framework Formation Team to develop, publish, and solicit public 

comment on a proposal for a governance framework.  This work group will carry out 

many of the task force recommendations and the Federal Reserve, at the request of the 

task force, is chairing and facilitating this effort.  

In addition, the Federal Reserve is considering providing settlement services—a 

traditional core function of a central bank—to address the future needs of a ubiquitous 

real-time retail payments environment.  We plan to actively engage with the industry and 

other stakeholders to further understand gaps and requirements for real-time retail 

payments settlement and assess alternative models that will support needs over the long 

term.  We also plan to explore and assess the need, if any, for other related Federal 

Reserve services or capabilities.  In carrying out this assessment, we will be guided by

current and potential market developments and challenges, as well as our long-

established criteria for offering new products and services.  These criteria include the 

need to fully recover costs over the long term; the expectation that the new service will 

yield clear public benefit; and the expectation that other providers alone cannot be 

expected to provide the service with a reasonable effectiveness, scope, and equity.9 

The Federal Reserve will also continue to support the ongoing work of the Secure 

Payments Task Force.  This task force has been working to educate stakeholders on 

payment security practices, risks, and actions that could enhance payment security.  

These are challenging topics, because they require stakeholders to be open and 

forthcoming about potential vulnerabilities if there is to be substantial progress.   

The Federal Reserve will also pursue two new efforts focused on security.  Early 

in 2018, we plan to launch a study analyzing payment security vulnerabilities.  This study 

is similar to other research efforts that the Federal Reserve has pursued to build 

foundational and collective understanding of the U.S. payment system.  We also plan to 

build upon the contributions of the Secure Payments Task Force to establish work groups 

focused on approaches for reducing the cost and prevalence of specific payment security 

vulnerabilities.  In a world of ever-escalating threats to the integrity of our payment 

system, this collective action is needed to sustain public confidence. 

These were just a few of our new initiatives.  The package of next steps the 

Federal Reserve outlined in its recent paper confirm that we remain steadfast in our 

commitment to work with industry and other stakeholders to achieve a better payment 

system through both leadership and action.

Summary 

Rapidly changing technology is providing a historic opportunity to transform our 

daily lives, including the way we pay.  Fintech firms and banks are embracing this 

change, as they strive to address consumer demands for more timely and convenient 

payments.  A range of innovative products that seamlessly integrate with other services is 

now available at our fingertips.  It is essential, however, that this innovation not come at 

the cost of a safe and secure payment system that retains the confidence of its end users.  

The examples I have drawn upon today highlight that fintech firms and banks must each 

play a role in assuring that enhancements to convenience and speed do not undermine 

safety and security.  More broadly, the Faster and Secure Payments Task Forces 

demonstrate the importance of broad and diverse stakeholder input, which are essential if 

the United States is to implement safe, ubiquitous real-time retail payments.  Working 

together, we can achieve a safe and fast payments system that meets the evolving needs 

of consumers and our dynamic economy.
