Thank you for this opportunity to show my support for the work all of you do on 

asset-building, and to say a few words on this vitally important topic.   

The financial crisis and the Great Recession demonstrated, in a dramatic and 

unmistakable manner, how extraordinarily vulnerable are the large share of American 

families with very few assets to fall back on.  We have come far from the worst moments 

of the crisis, and the economy continues to improve.  But the effects of the recession are 

still being felt by many families, particularly those that had very little in savings and 

other assets beforehand. 

To help make this point, I’d like to cite a few numbers from the Federal Reserve’s 

2013 Survey of Consumer Finances, published earlier this month.  The Survey is 

conducted every three years and this new edition provides one of the first good looks at 

how families in different economic circumstances have fared in the recovery. 

For lower-income families, what we find is sobering.  The median net worth 

reported by the bottom fifth of households by income was only $6,400 in 2013.  Among 

this group, representing about 25 million American households, many families had no 

wealth or had negative net worth.  The next fifth of households by income had median 

net worth of just $27,900.  These numbers represent declines from 2010.  One reason is 

that income has continued to fall for these families.   

Another likely reason for this decline in net worth is the lingering effects of the 

housing crisis.  Home equity accounts for the lion’s share of wealth for most families and 

many of these families have not yet recovered the wealth they lost in the housing crisis.  

The housing market is improving and housing will remain an important channel for asset 

building for lower and middle income families.  But one of the lessons of the crisis,

which will not be news to many of you, is the importance of diversification and 

especially of possessing savings and other liquid financial assets to fall back in times of 

economic distress.   

Yet for lower and middle income families, financial assets, including 401 (k) 

plans and pensions, are still a very small share of their assets.  According to the 2013 

survey, the bottom half of families by income held only 8 percent of all financial assets 

held by households. 

A larger lesson from the financial crisis, of course, is how important it is to 

promote asset-building, including saving for a rainy day, as protection from the ups and 

downs of the economy.  I surely hope that our nation will not face another crisis anytime 

soon as severe as the one we recently experienced.  But for many lower-income families 

without assets, the definition of a financial crisis is a month or two without a paycheck, or 

the advent of a sudden illness or some other unexpected expense.  Families with assets to 

draw on are able to deal with these developments as bumps in the road.  Families without 

these assets can end up, very suddenly, off the road.  According to the Board’s recent 

Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking, an unexpected expense of just 

$400 would prompt the majority of households to borrow money, sell something, or 

simply not pay at all. 

The Federal Reserve’s mission is to promote a healthy economy and strong 

financial system, and that is why we have promoted and will continue to promote asset-

building.  One way we do this is through the Community Development programs at each 

of our 12 Reserve Banks, and through the Federal Reserve Board’s Division of Consumer 

and Community Affairs in Washington.  As a research institution, and a convener of

stakeholders involved in community development, I believe the Fed can help you in 

carrying out your mission, to encourage families to take the small steps that over time can 

lead to the accumulation of considerable assets. 

Thank you for the chance to be a small part of this conference, and for your 

commitment to a cause that I strongly support.
