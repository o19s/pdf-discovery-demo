Reflections on Reputation and its Consequences 





Remarks by

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System

2013 Banking Outlook Conference 


Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 



Atlanta, Georgia 



February 28, 2013


Good afternoon.  I want to thank the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta for inviting me to 

join you for today’s 2013 banking outlook discussion.  There are a number of interesting and 

very relevant topics on your agenda, most of which are rightly focused on the financial and 

regulatory environment.  I would like to share some thoughts this afternoon on a broader topic, 

however, that may be due for a refreshed look:  the relevance of a bank’s reputation.  

Let’s start in an elementary way in constructing a concept of reputation: We know that 

reputation is not entirely a moral trait.  We understand that there is a distinction between 

character and reputation.  When we say that someone shows good character, we are usually 

referring to something at the core of their being or personality.  On the other hand, when we refer 

to a person’s reputation, we recognize that reputation is our perception of the person, that it is 

externally derived and not necessarily intrinsic to that individual.  In other words, we understand 

that a person may not have complete control over the perception that has been created.  

Reputation, through no fault of one’s own, can be tarnished.  In the same way, one’s reputation 

can be golden, even though nothing was done to earn it.  But like the notion of character, 

reputation can be earned and it can be a type of stored value for when challenges to one’s own 

reputation come later.  

Now let’s bring this distinction into the context of banks:  Many bankers have a sterling 

character, and they operate financial institutions with sterling reputations that reflect that basic 

character.  At the same time, there are bankers who, regardless of their personal character, 

manage financial institutions with reputations that have been tarnished.  Their banks’ reputations 

could have been tarnished by almost anything, but likely most tarnish is attributable to the 

subprime mortgage meltdown and the ensuing financial crisis that cost the economy trillions of 


- 2 - 


dollars; left millions of Americans bankrupted, jobless, underemployed, or homeless; triggered 

massive litigation; and shook the confidence of our nation to the core.  

Many of the darkest manifestations of the financial crisis have finally begun to diminish:  

the boarded-up homes with overgrown lawns, the half-built skyscrapers, the “We Buy Houses 

Cheap” signs planted at exit ramps, the eviction notices nailed to front doors.  But even as the 

economy comes back to life, our memory of these events is still sharp and the reputational 

damage suffered by U.S. financial institutions during the crisis endures.  To be blunt, a lot of 

people have negative feelings about banks, which they distrust and blame for the huge infusions 

of taxpayer money into the financial system that were deemed necessary during the crisis.   

These reputational consequences--whether justified or not--are to be expected.  

Sociologists and economists have long remarked upon the central role that social trust plays in 

healthy markets.  Market transactions depend on a whole series of assumptions that people must 

be able to rely on, including the soundness of money, the enforceability of contracts, the good 

will of their partners, the integrity of the legal system, and the common meanings of language.  

Social trust is the glue that holds markets and societies together.  In the context of banking, 

social trust and reputation are related concepts.   

Banks themselves--in crisis or not--are particularly vulnerable to reputational 

consequences because of their public role.  The principal social value of financial institutions is 

their ability to facilitate the efficient deployment of funds held by investors (and entities that 

pool these funds) to productive uses.

  This value is maximized when the cost to the entity 

putting capital to work is close to the price demanded by the entity that seeks a return on its

investment.  In traditional banking, this means that financial intermediation occurs most 

effectively when the interest rate charged for use of funds in lending is close to the interest rate 

paid for deposits.  As the difference between the two grows (which would be attributable to 

amounts extracted by intermediaries as compensation for essential intermediation), the costs of 

borrowing for the purposes of creating productive projects become higher than they should be, 

with arguably negative reputational consequences. 

Given these particular reputational dimensions associated with financial institutions, 

might financial regulators have an interest in considering reputational harms analytically?  Could 

there be benefits to understanding the ways that an individual financial institution’s reputation--

or that of the financial industry as a whole--might have particular effects on, for example, safety 

and soundness, financial inclusion, or financial innovation? 

In my remarks today, I want to consider various aspects of how reputational harm 

manifests itself in banks and begin a dialogue with you about how we might refresh our thinking 

about this category of risk.  I will start with a description of some factors that can affect a bank’s 

reputation, especially in the wake of the financial crisis.  Next, I will talk about ways in which 

reputation matters, including how supervisors can use their unique ability to see inside the 

institutions that they examine to uncover some early indicators of reputational problems.  I will 

then turn to other reasons why policymakers may want to think about reputation.  One reason 

involves possible consequences regarding financial inclusion; that is, a customer’s ability to have 

a relationship with his or her bank that puts them in the position to save, access credit in a 

sustainable way, and understand the nature of the financial transactions in which they participate.  

Reputation also may help or hinder a bank’s ability to innovate, so I will introduce this topic 

next.  Finally, I want to frame a discussion around the recent cybersecurity threats that banks are 


- 4 - 


facing and place them in the context of reputational risk so that they too can be discussed 

constructively. 

Of course, I preface these remarks with the admonition that these views are my own and 

may not be representative of those of the Federal Reserve Board. 

The Financial Crisis and the Reputation of Financial Institutions  

It has been more than five years since this country began experiencing a financial crisis 

that reverberated well beyond Wall Street.  This crisis was unique, and many of its marks on 

individuals and communities remain.  It was a crisis in which significant numbers of both 

subprime and prime mortgage defaults quickly spread across whole cities and regions until the 

impact was felt throughout the country.  The devastation was magnified by waves of 

foreclosures, significant drops in house values, job losses, and, ultimately, significant reductions 

in household wealth, which have been responsible, in part, for the slow recovery we confront 

today.  

The causes of the crisis and the subsequent devastation are myriad, but to large swaths of 

the American public who have experienced the devastation, the causes rest squarely on the 

shoulders of financial institutions, especially the largest institutions.  Further, many Americans 

direct their anger at not only banks, but policymakers as well.  Because the economy pulled back 

from the brink of depression only through a massive and unprecedented infusion of public 

dollars, American taxpayers feel that they were forced into a position of accepting that the 

government had to put a lot on the line to save the financial system from ruin.  And many of 

those taxpayers are still unhappy about such a massive government intervention that seemed to 

aid banks that were not held to account, while distressed households were left to pay the price.

 The public also remains angry at policymakers for actions taken since the crisis.  The erosion of public trust 

extends beyond financial institutions to the government officials that oversee them.  For example, an American

Unfortunately, in the public’s view, little has happened to restore their trust and 

confidence in financial institutions.  Since the crisis, the public’s views of banks have been 

informed--for better or worse--by their experiences and those of their families and neighbors, 

who may have lost their homes, their jobs, or their household wealth.  Many attempted 

unsuccessfully to modify their underwater mortgages, even when they were current on their 

payments.  Against this backdrop, the public’s lack of trust and confidence has been magnified 

by, among other things, the Occupy Wall Street movement, payday loans, overdraft fees, rate-

rigging settlements in London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) cases, executive compensation 

and bonuses that seem to bear no relationship to performance or risk, failures in the foreclosure 

process, and a drumbeat of civil litigation.   

In the Internet age, the impact of consumer distrust is amplified: anyone can easily, 

cheaply, and anonymously create, organize, and participate in a protest.  Participants do not have 

to gather physically to make their action felt.  A recent survey found that 

 60 percent of American adults use social media, such as Facebook or Twitter, and 

 66 percent of those social media users (39 percent of all American adults) have used social 

media to engage on civic and political issues, including by encouraging other people to take 

action on a political or social issue.

Take, for example, the impact of the consumer backlash that erupted in late 2011 when one 

of the nation’s largest banks attempted to charge a $5 monthly fee for its debit card.  A 

California woman, frustrated with the bank’s decision to impose the fee, created a Facebook 

                                                                                                                                                             
Banker reader poll conducted from December 17–23, 2012, found that a mere 8 percent of readers who responded 

thought authorities took the right course in the case of enforcement against HSBC for money laundering violations.  

As many as 47 percent said the Justice Department should have prosecuted the bank, while another 45 percent said 

authorities should have gone after the individuals responsible for the violations.

event, dubbed “Bank Transfer Day,” and invited her friends to join her in transferring their 

money from large banks to credit unions on that day.  In the five weeks leading up to Bank 

Transfer Day, this Facebook event received extensive press coverage and resulted in billions of 

dollars in deposits reportedly shifting out of large banks.  The bank targeted by the Facebook 

protest ultimately reversed itself and declined to assess the monthly fee. 

How Reputational Risk May Be Relevant   

Financial institutions of all sizes have shared in the fall-out--fairly or unfairly--from a 

general decline in their industry’s reputation among the public.  Moreover, the steady stream of 

litigation against financial institutions since the crisis has further harmed the reputations of 

specific firms among their customers.   

Consider that in today’s financial institution sector, a substantial portion of a bank’s 

enterprise value comes from intangible assets such as brand recognition and customer loyalty 

that may not appear on the balance sheet but are nevertheless critical to the bank’s success.  Also 

consider that at the end of 2012, deposits at commercial banks reached a record $10 trillion.  At 

the same time, the share of each deposit dollar that banks lent out hit a post-financial crisis low 

in the third quarter, which means that banks’ net interest margins have fallen sharply.  Across the 

industry, loan-to-deposit ratios are going down.  In 2007, banks’ aggregate loan-to-deposit ratio 

was 91 percent.  This ratio currently stands at 70 percent.  In such a context, achieving higher 

earnings is a challenge. 

If bank profitability is going to improve in a context of low interest rates and higher 

compliance costs, lending income may remain low.  Profits will need to come from elsewhere.  

One source of profits would be products that are not interest-rate dependent, but fee-dependent.   


- 7 - 


In other words, compressed net interest margins mean that many banks may look to new 

fee-generating products and trading activity to enhance profits.  The pressure to generate 

enhanced profits through high fees is palpable, and banks may choose to move aggressively 

down these paths.  But when a bank already suffers from a poor reputation--either deservedly or 

as a knock-on effect of broader discontent with the financial industry--it likely will face 

difficulties in introducing new fee-generating products or activities without inviting further 

criticism and damage to its reputation.  So an evaluation of the effects of the new product or 

activity on the bank’s reputation prior to launch is arguably necessary.   

Reputational Risk and Supervision 

The effects of the financial crisis, combined with the power of the Internet to broadly and 

quickly publicize information--whether factually accurate or not--should alert banks to how they 

are managing their reputations.  And supervisors have a duty to see that all risks are fully 

understood, even those risks that, like reputational risk, are unquantifiable or have not fully 

emerged.  I believe this is an area where supervision can add value.  To the extent possible, 

supervision can unveil hidden loss exposures that may be building up through the accumulation 

of reputational risk elements.  If we were better able to identify and monitor such free-floating 

risk, and in so doing, to push bank boards of directors and senior management to pay more 

attention to reputational risk, we could help reduce the underpricing of these risks. 

Many have argued, and I think it’s a compelling argument, that ineffective supervision 

and enforcement of existing laws and regulations contributed to the financial crisis.  By 

tolerating reduced transparency of risk in balance sheets and in complex institutional portfolios, 

as well as arbitrage around capital requirements and other prudential measures, supervision may 

have encouraged the underpricing of risk.  And the sudden correction of this underpricing of 


- 8 - 


risk,

 in turn, accelerated the crisis.  The crisis punished investors who accepted more risk than 

they thought they had taken on, it punished consumers who overleveraged themselves, it 

punished Americans who lost their jobs and homes, and it contributed to the decline of once-

vibrant neighborhoods and towns. 

To mitigate the chances of such a crisis occurring again, supervisors need to redouble 

their efforts toward promoting greater transparency of risks and early confrontation of potential 

loss exposures.  We should view these efforts as a set of responsibilities for both banks and 

regulators that are aligned to assure the public and markets that risks can be fully understood and 

accurately estimated and priced. 

In some ways, this perspective is not new territory for bank regulators.  The Federal 

Reserve, for example, issued supervisory guidance in 1995 that identified the six primary risks 

that remain the focus of its supervisory program, and reputational risk is among them.
5
  Having 

said that, it is still a risk that both banks and supervisors should learn how to identify ex ante 

rather than ex post.
6
 

So, while reputational risk is not a new concept by any means, it is an area that is ripe for 

additional work.  For example, the enterprise risk management framework of the Committee of 

Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission--the so-called “COSO standard”--does 

                                                 
4
 The reasons for ineffective supervision can be explored separately; they are beyond the scope of my remarks today.  

It is worth considering, however, whether the reputation of large banks would be enhanced by a belief that 

“regulatory capture” and other manifestations of ineffective supervision could be minimized. 
5
 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation (1995), 

“Rating the Adequacy of Risk Management Processes and Internal Controls at State Member Banks and Bank 

Holding Companies,” Supervision and Regulation Letter 95-51 (SUP) (November 14). 
6
 Other regulators consider reputation risk as part of their supervisory programs.  The Public Company Accounting 

Oversight Board (PCAOB) has integrated reputational risk into its guidance on how an auditor should evaluate a 

company’s internal controls and corporate governance environment.  Other PCAOB standards include reputational 

risk as it relates to executive compensation structures.

not address reputational risk.  Likewise, the Basel capital frameworks exclude reputational risks 

from regulatory capital requirements.
7
   

Accordingly, the current approach to managing reputational risk is largely reactive rather 

than proactive.  Banks and examiners tend to focus their energies on handling the threats to their 

reputations that have already surfaced.  This is not risk management; it is crisis management--a 

reactive approach aimed at limiting the damage.  Instead, we should think about a supervisory 

approach that incentivizes bank managers to sufficiently contemplate, quantify if necessary, and 

control the factors that affect the level of such risks before they fully emerge in an unmitigated 

form. 

The way that the Federal Reserve supervises banking organizations may help identify 

risks sooner.  For all banking organizations, the supervisory program here does not simply rely 

on an annual onsite examination.  The Federal Reserve supplements its regular examination 

activities with a program of continuous monitoring between examinations.  One of the key 

objectives of this program is to identify emerging risks and communicate with other regulators 

and the banks an updated risk assessment and supervisory strategy based on these risks.   

When we contemplate a supervisory approach that illuminates reputational risk, we might 

be able to more fully uncover the interconnection of risks that certain activities could impose on 

investors, creditors, counterparties, and taxpayers.  In this approach, we would first and foremost 

need to encourage banks to assess the potential riskiness of particular operations, investments, 

products, and decisions to their reputations and, ultimately, to their enterprise value.  As 

supervisors, one objective as we work with financial institutions to extract such information 

                                                 
7
 Pillar 2 of the Basel II capital framework, however, does note that internationally active banks are expected to hold 

sufficient capital to address all significant risks, including reputational risk, as part of their internal capital adequacy 

assessment processes.

would be to try to develop ways of measuring the value of the risks that banks shift onto the 

financial safety net.   

Reputation and Financial Inclusion 

There is also a relationship between reputation and financial inclusion, by which I mean 

the extent to which consumers can participate in a financial marketplace that consists of 

competitive providers of credit, savings vehicles, and sources of enabling financial information.  

As policymakers, we must address the perceived trustworthiness of those financial institutions 

that interact with the public and move the millions of Americans lingering in the margins of the 

financial marketplace into relationships that provide them with sustainable access to banking and 

credit, an understanding of how mortgages and credit work, and an understanding of how to 

create savings. 

Data from the Federal Reserve’s Survey of Consumer Finances and the Federal Deposit 

Insurance Corporation’s survey of the unbanked and underbanked show that the percentage of 

families earning $15,000 per year or less who reported that they have no bank account has been 

increasing steadily for the past five years, resulting in more than 28 percent of these families 

being unbanked as of 2011.
8
  Families slightly further up the income distribution scale, earning 

between $15,000 and $30,000 per year, are also financially marginalized:  12 percent reported 

being unbanked and almost 26 percent reported being underbanked in 2011.
9
   

There are several potential reasons for these impediments to inclusion.  When we 

examine barriers that individual consumers face in becoming financially included, we uncover 

trustworthiness and reputation.  A Federal Reserve analysis of the most recent Survey of

Bulletin, v. 95 (February), pp. A1–A55.

Consumer Finances suggests that the primary reason individuals do not have a transaction 

account is a simple dislike of dealing with financial institutions.
10

  If that dislike emanates from 

the reputation of the particular bank, or the reputation of the banking industry as a whole, 

policymakers and financial institutions will not be able to enhance financial inclusion without 

addressing the reputational context. 

Reputation and Innovation 


I’d like to imagine how the public’s sense of well-being might be enhanced by their 

interactions with financial institutions.  If we paid attention to the experiences of consumers as 

they interact with various segments of the financial marketplace, what could we learn?  If we see 

rigidities or imperfections in that interactive experience, what innovation might we imagine that 

would not only reduce reputational risk but create something new and potentially advantageous?   

Technological innovation was the subject of a recent award ceremony in San Francisco.  

The winners were companies with names like SoundCloud, GitHub, MakerBot, Techmeme, and 

Snapchat, all of which presumably do amazing things, although I don’t understand exactly 

what.
11

  But, evidently, the real buzz at the ceremony was over something much more mundane 

that I for one have no problem understanding.  That buzz was around a pedestrian item--a new 

and improved coffee cup lid.
12

  This lid, called FoamAroma, reportedly provides exactly the 

right set of openings to maximize aroma and recyclability, while minimizing the effects of coffee 

spurting out too fast.  The point here is that the innovator noticed something simple that others 

had not:  many coffee shop employees don’t drink their coffee from cups with plastic lids like 

their customers do, so there was a market need that had not been recognized and then addressed.

Here I am not just talking about the mixed miracle of mobile banking and mobile 

payments or being able to take a picture of a check with a smart phone and it appearing in my 

checking account.  That’s a topic that is amazing in its own right and worthy of a separate 

speech.  I am talking about encouraging banks to pay attention to the banking experiences of 

their customers and finding process improvements or service elements that may lead to 

something seemingly mundane but valuable nonetheless. 

Some innovators see reputation itself as not just something to be managed, but as a 

product in and of itself.  With buyers and sellers repeatedly and constantly interacting on the 

Internet, there are “reputation trails” that are being created that, when compiled, give an 

alternative set of markers about how trustworthy a particular buyer or seller may be.  These 

reputation trails--gathered when you evaluate a product you’ve bought online or when you 

deliver the product that you’ve promised--create a picture of trust that some have argued has 

value that can be shaped.

Reputational Risks and Cybersecurity 


Perhaps reputation will one day transform commerce.  But in the meantime, I would like 

to mention one set of reputational issues that the banking industry is confronting as we speak.  

As is the case for reputation trails, it too involves the Internet, but this use of the Internet is not 

being done in the spirit of cooperation and enhancement of public trust.  This set of reputational 

issues comes in response to the recent substantial increase in cyberattacks, all of which have the 

potential to undermine the fundamental trust that the public puts into financial institutions.   

Cyberattacks on banks are occurring with increasing frequency, and concerted 

cooperative work between government and financial institutions is underway.  Customers are

Edinburgh, Scotland, June.

increasingly being affected by the cybersecurity threats that banks face.  Recently, distributed 

denial-of-service attacks have caused temporary disruptions of some web services.  In 

September, the websites of several large banks were rendered inaccessible for several hours from 

attacks now attributed to possible foreign state-sponsored hackers.  One of the greatest threats 

facing not just banks but many businesses and government agencies is hacking--and the possible 

theft of proprietary data and personal information about customers. 

This cybersecurity threat is increasing at a time when more and more bank customers 

depend on electronic and mobile banking.  Workers are using their own laptops and smart 

phones or working remotely from home computers, and this increases the entry points to the 

systems that need to be protected.  In addition, customers and vendors are linking their systems, 

enhancing efficiency, but also creating more opportunities for potential intrusions. 

But even beyond the potential theft of data and disruption of service, cyberattacks can 

represent significant reputational risk because they have the potential to create dissatisfaction 

among many customers or, even more chilling, total loss of consumer confidence. 

Cooperative work between government and industry is underway.  Through the 

Department of the Treasury, many of the affected institutions have requested and received 

technical assistance from the Department of Homeland Security, which has been helpful in 

mitigating the attacks.  Some institutions are researching new technologies for defense against 

cyberattacks through their Internet service providers or security vendors, and others are 

reviewing their incident response processes to better manage recovery time and communications 

among information technology, employees, vendors, media, and customers. 

The Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, the Financial Services 

Information Sharing and Analysis Center, and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating 


- 14 - 


Council are serving as the forum through which the financial services sector shares important 

information and develops critical infrastructure protection policies.  Through their coordination, 

affected institutions and law enforcement agencies can share threat information and mitigation 

techniques.  

In addition, a recent Executive Order issued by the President represents a continued 

commitment to enhancing the security and resiliency of the nation’s critical infrastructure to 

meet future threats.
14


Conclusion  
 

In closing, these have been some of my reflections on reputation as it applies to the 

business of banks.  The concept of trust is relevant to how bankers engage in a business that is of 

benefit to the public and provides meaningful innovation to the core function of financial 

intermediation, as well as to how we as supervisors can engage in a process of observation that is 

forward-looking and of benefit to both the public and the institutions that we regulate.        

Thank you for your attention today.  I look forward to taking your questions.
