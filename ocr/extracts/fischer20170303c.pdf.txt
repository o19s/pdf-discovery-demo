In recent years, reforms in the monetary policy decisionmaking process in central 

banks have been in the direction of an increasing number of monetary policy committees 

and fewer single decisionmakers--the lone governor model.1  We are only a few months 

away from the 20th anniversary of the introduction of the Bank of England’s Monetary 

Policy Committee, just a few years after the 300th birthday of the venerable Old Lady of 

Threadneedle Street.  The Bank of Israel moved from a single policymaker to a monetary 

policy committee in 2010, while I was governor there; more recently, central banks in 

India and New Zealand have handed over monetary policy to committees. 

The Federal Reserve is not part of this recent shift, however.  The Federal Open 

Market Committee (FOMC) has been responsible for monetary policy decisions in the 

United States since it was established by the Banking Act of 1935, two decades after the 

founding of the Fed itself.2 

The movement toward committees reflects the advantages of committees in 

aggregating a wide range of information, perspectives, and models.  Despite the 

prevalence and importance of committees in modern central banking, the role of 

committees in the formulation of policy has not attracted nearly as much academic 

attention as has the research on monetary policy rules.3 

The literature on monetary policy rules stretches back to at least Adam Smith and 

includes important contributions from David Ricardo, Knut Wicksell, and Milton 

                                                 
1 I am grateful to Joseph Gruber and Ellen Meade of the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance.  The 
views expressed are mine and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open 
Market Committee. 
2 Although the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the institutional structure and governance that we have 
today date from 1935.  See Bordo (2016) and Wheelock (2000). 
3 It is true, though, that popular books on prominent central banks typically relate more frequently to the 
outstanding governors or presidents of the central banks than they do to the organizational structure of 
those banks.

Friedman.More recently, John Taylor has moved the research agenda forward with his 

eponymous rule, and a large number of academic papers have been written examining the 

effectiveness and robustness of policy rules.4  In contrast, as noted, study of the role of 

committees in making monetary policy has been fairly light, notwithstanding the 

insightful work of Alan Blinder and others.5     

Committees and rules may appear to be in opposition as approaches to 

policymaking.  One might even argue that if a central bank ever converged on a single 

monetary rule, there would be no need for a monetary policy committee.  In practice, the 

Fed operates through a committee structure and considers the recommendations of a 

variety of monetary rules as we make monetary policy decisions.  Our decision is 

typically whether to raise or reduce the federal funds rate or to leave it unchanged.  

Committees can aggregate large amounts of diverse information--not just data, but also 

anecdotes and impressions that would be hard to quantify numerically.  Good committees 

also offer a variety of perspectives and underlying economic models for interpreting the 

economy.  In contrast, a policy rule, strictly defined, is numerical and constrained to a 

single perspective on the economy. 

Committees and rules each have their advantages.  Committees embody a wider 

range of information and have a capacity for innovation.  Rules can simplify central bank 

communications, a particularly important feature in forward-looking models of the 

economy.  In contrast, the diversity of views that makes a committee work can sometimes 

                                                 
4 See Taylor (1979), Taylor (1993), Taylor (1999).  A few other notable papers from the vast literature on 
monetary policy rules include Orphanides and Williams (2002), Walsh (2009), and Williams (2003). 
5 See Blinder (1998) and Blinder (2004).  Other important contributions to the literature on monetary policy 
committees include Blinder and Morgan (2005); Chappell, McGregor, and Vermilyea (2005); Gerlach-
Kristin (2004); Meade and Stasavage (2008); Ruge-Murcia and Riboni (2010); and Warsh (2016).

pose a communications challenge, as the frequent complaints about the cacophony of 

messages coming out of the FOMC illustrate.6 

In the remainder of my discussion, I would like to elaborate on some of the 

features of committees that have contributed to their prevalence in monetary 

policymaking.  I will then discuss monetary policy rules and some of the difficulties in 

developing robust rules for policy. 

 
Why Do Almost All Central Banks Make Their Monetary Policy Decisions in a 

Committee? 

Let us turn to central bank decisionmaking.  One of the striking facts about the 

Fed is that it is the third central bank of the United States.  Whereas the long-lived central 

banks of Europe--the Riksbank and the Bank of England--have survived for more than 

three centuries, the Fed has only recently become a centenarian. 

Roger Lowenstein’s book America’s Bank convinces the reader that it was no 

easy matter to establish this third central bank.  It also establishes for those coming to the 

issue for the first time that the major issues related to the Fed’s structure were political.  

That is, underlying the disagreements about the establishment of the Federal Reserve was 

the concern that the central bank not upset the balance of economic power within the U.S. 

economy.  Indeed, it was not until 1935 that the present structure of the FOMC was 

established, in which the 7 members of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., 

who are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate, vote along with 5 of 

the 12 Reserve Bank presidents at any given meeting.7 

                                                 
6 For a discussion of the cacophony issue, see Faust (2016) and Powell (2016). 
7 The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is a permanent member of the FOMC.  Four 
votes rotate annually among the remaining 11 Reserve Bank presidents.

So, why policy committees?  What makes them so special?  There are several 

reasons to prefer decisionmaking by committee:  For one thing, each committee member 

brings to the table his or her own perspective or view of the world, as well as valuable 

information that others on the committee haven’t heard.  Moreover, committees are less 

likely to take extreme positions--discussion, deliberation, and voting tends to drive policy 

outcomes toward compromise.  Committees also tend to be less volatile or activist, 

imparting an inertia to policymaking that could be desirable--or perhaps undesirable 

when activism is required.8  Finally, academic studies have shown that a combination of 

forecasts is more accurate, over time, than a single forecast.9  Putting it all together, 

committees are, on average, likely to make better monetary policy decisions than 

individuals--an assertion that has received support from academic experiments in which 

undergraduate students played a part. 

Notwithstanding the shift toward monetary policy committees, each central bank 

and its institutional structure reflects the politics and culture of the country that it serves 

(or “countries” in the case of the European Central Bank).  The Federal Reserve is no 

exception, as Lowenstein’s book demonstrates.  In the years before 1913, the United 

States suffered through a series of financial crises culminating in the Panic of 1907.  That 

panic convinced many important stakeholders--William Jennings Bryan, the leader of the 

Populist movement; Paul Warburg, a prominent financier; Nelson Aldrich, a powerful 

Republican senator; and Carter Glass, the Democratic chair of the House Committee on 

                                                 
8 In an experimental study in which undergraduates played a monetary policy game by themselves and in 
groups of five, Lombardelli, Proudman, and Talbot (2005) found group decisions to be more inertial than 
individual decisions but closer to that of a policy rule, although Blinder and Morgan (2005) found that 
groups were no different from individuals in terms of policy activism.  A recent study by Ruge-Murcia and 
Riboni (forthcoming) of Bank of Israel policy before and after its change from a single governor to a 
committee found that committee decisions were more inertial than individual ones.

Banking and Currency--that America needed a central bank.  Our unique structure with 

the Board of Governors in Washington and the 12 Reserve Banks scattered around the 

country reflected a years-long struggle to balance a variety of competing interests:  

farmers in the heartlands and financiers on Wall Street; populists and federalists; and 

creditors and debtors.  Our central bank and its policy committee importantly reflect the 

deal the Fed’s founders struck to resolve those competing interests and create an 

institution representing America’s economic and geographic diversity.10 

I should add that I find the regional balance created by the membership of the 

FOMC to be a valuable feature of its structure.  In the first round of policymaker 

discussion at a typical FOMC meeting, most of the presidents of the Reserve Banks start 

their presentations with a description of economic developments in their Federal Reserve 

District.11  From these presentations, one understands what a massive and diverse 

economy the United States is and why the politicians who established the Fed were right 

to require its decisions to be made by a committee. 

Robust Rules for Monetary Policy 

I turn now to economic models and monetary policy rules.  I recently gave a 

lecture at the University of Warwick entitled “I’d Rather Have Bob Solow Than an 

Econometric Model, But . . . ,” with the punch line quote from Paul Samuelson saved for 

the end:  “I’d rather have Bob Solow than an econometric model, but I would rather have 

Bob Solow with an econometric model than without one.”12  To summarize, the speech 

                                                 
10 In addition, in more recent times, the Federal Reserve System has placed greater emphasis on other 
aspects of diversity. 
11 While only a subset of Reserve Bank presidents vote at any given FOMC meeting, all of them offer their 
views in our discussions of the economy and of monetary policy. 
12 See Fischer (2017).

discussed the important role that models and policy rules play in FOMC discussions and 

decisionmaking. 

Shortly after the speech, I received an e-mail from an old and esteemed colleague, 

Professor Athanasios Orphanides, with the subject line “I’d rather have Bob Solow with a 

model and a rule (following a careful evaluation process).”  What does a careful 

evaluation process entail?  I will paraphrase my correspondent at length.13 

Professor Orphanides’s recommendation is that the FOMC adopt a reference rule, 

based on a rigorous evaluation and paying particular emphasis to (1) robustness to model 

uncertainty, (2) robustness to natural rate uncertainty, (3) robustness to expectations 

formation, (4) robustness to the size of shocks and the effective lower bound, and (5) 

whatever else the Fed staff has identified as a gap in our knowledge that may matter in 

evaluation.  He suggested that, ultimately, the FOMC could arrive at a simple rule that 

would serve as a good benchmark to guide policy. 

My colleague certainly lays out an impressive work program for the Board’s 

cadre of Ph.D. economists.  However, I tend to agree with John Taylor and my Fed 

colleague John Williams when they write that “the search for better and more robust 

policy rules is never done.”14 

                                                 
13 The direct quotation from Professor Orphanides is as follows:  “My recommendation had been that the 
FOMC should adopt a reference rule, based on rigorous evaluation, using the technology the Fed staff has 
developed over the past couple of decades and paying particular emphasis on various aspects of robustness:  
(1) robustness to model uncertainty, (FRB/US (various vintages), EDO, SIGMA (again various vintages) 
and others),  (2) robustness to natural rate uncertainty, u*, r*, Q*, fx* and so on,  (3) robustness to 
expectations formation (mode[l] consistent, learning, partial learning by businesses/households, etc.), (4) 
robustness to the size of shocks and the ZLB [zero lower bound] (given that certainty equivalence does not 
hold), (5) whatever else the staff research has identified as a gap in our knowledge that may matter in 
evaluation.  The evaluation should allow for forecast-based rules as well as outcome-based rules and could 
be updated on an annual basis to incorporate new information.  But ultimately, the FOMC could arrive at a 
simple rule that would be, in the Committee’s judgment, a good benchmark to guide policy.”   
14 See Taylor and Williams (2011), p. 855.

My take is that rules are extremely useful reference tools, but they are likely to 

work best as inputs into a committee decision.  Why?  Let me reiterate some points I 

made in Warwick.  First, the economy is very complex, and models that attempt to 

approximate that complexity can sometimes let us down.  A particular difficulty is that 

expectations of the future play a critical role in determining how the economy reacts to a 

policy change.  Moreover, the economy changes over time--this means that policymakers 

need to be able to adapt their models promptly and accurately in real time.  And, finally, 

no one model or policy rule can capture the varied experiences and views brought to 

policymaking by a committee.  All of these factors and more recommend against 

accepting the prescriptions of any one model, policy rule, or policymaker.
