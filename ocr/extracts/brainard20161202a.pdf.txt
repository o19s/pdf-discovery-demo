Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the 
 

Conference on Financial Innovation at the Board of Governors of the  
Federal Reserve System

Introduction 

On behalf of the Board of Governors, I would like to welcome you to our 

conference on emerging financial technologies, or fintech.  I’d like to begin by 

remembering our Federal Reserve colleague Teresa Curran--executive vice president and 

director of Supervision at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco--who recently 

passed away after a long illness.  Teresa’s leadership on fintech was one of her many 

extraordinary contributions to the System.  With her characteristic enthusiasm, Teresa 

helped us prioritize this topic early on and had a strong influence in helping shape our 

work program--with an emphasis on assessing the opportunities and challenges of fintech 

in a balanced way.  We already miss her wise counsel here.  I’m sure Teresa would have 

appreciated this conference’s gathering of academics, industry participants, and 

policymakers to exchange information and discuss current research related to financial 

innovation.   

Why Is Fintech Important? 

In my remarks today, I’d like to share a few thoughts about emerging financial 

technologies and their relevance to our work.1  Fintech has the potential to transform the 

way that financial services are delivered and designed as well as the underlying processes 

of payments, clearing, and settlement.2  The past few years have seen a proliferation of 

new digitally enabled financial products and services, in addition to new processes and 

platforms.  Just as smartphones revolutionized the way in which we interact with one 

                                                 
1 These remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve 
Board.

paper titled “Distributed Ledger Technology in Payments, Clearing and Settlement.”

another to communicate and share information, fintech may impact nearly every aspect of 

how we interact with each other financially, from payments and credit to savings and 

financial planning.  In our continuously connected, on-demand world, consumers, 

businesses, and financial institutions are all eager to find new ways to engage in financial 

transactions that are more convenient, timely, secure, and efficient.  

In many cases, fintech puts financial change at consumers’ fingertips--literally.  

Today’s consumers, particularly millennials, are accustomed to having a wide range of 

applications, options, and information immediately accessible to them.  Almost every 

type of consumer transaction--ordering groceries, downloading a movie, buying furniture, 

or arranging childcare, to name a few--can be done on a mobile device, and there are 

often multiple different applications that consumers can choose for each of these tasks 

based on their  preferences.  It seems inevitable for this kind of convenience, immediacy, 

and customization to extend to financial services.  Indeed, according to the Federal 

Reserve Board’s most recent survey of mobile financial services, fully two-thirds of 

consumers between the ages of 18 and 29 having a mobile phone and a bank account use 

mobile banking.3 

New fintech platforms are giving consumers and small businesses more real-time 

control over their finances.  Once broad adoption is achieved, it is technologically quite 

simple to conduct cashless person-to-person fund transfers, enabling, among other things, 

the splitting of a check after a meal out with friends or the sending of remittances quickly 

and cheaply to friends or family in other countries.  Financial management tools are

automating savings decisions based on what consumers can afford, and they are helping 

consumers set financial goals and providing feedback on expenditures that are 

inconsistent with those goals.  In some cases, fintech applications are automatically 

transferring spare account balances into savings, based on monthly spending and income 

patterns, effectively making savings the default choice.  Other applications are providing 

consumers with more real-time access to earnings as they are accrued rather than waiting 

for their regular payday.  This service may be particularly valuable to the nearly 50 

percent of adults with extremely limited liquid savings.4  It is too early to know what the 

overall impact of these innovations will be, but they offer the potential to empower 

consumers to better manage cash flow to reduce the need for more expensive credit 

products to cover short-term cash needs.5 

One particularly promising aspect of fintech is the potential to expand access to 

credit and other financial services for consumers and small businesses.  By reducing loan 

processing and underwriting costs, online origination platforms may enable financial 

services providers to more cost effectively offer smaller-balance loans to households and 

small businesses than had previously been feasible.6  In addition, broader analysis of data 

may allow lenders to better assess the creditworthiness of potential borrowers, facilitating 

                                                 
4 The Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking finds that 46 percent 
of households report that they would need to borrow money or sell something in order to pay an 
unexpected expense of $400.  The report of survey findings is available on the Board’s website at 
www.federalreserve.gov/communitydev/shed.htm. 
5 Robo-advisors are making investing and retirement planning cheaper and more accessible, filling a 
particular need as the coverage of employer-provided retirement plans has declined.  According to Insider 
Newsletter published by Willis Towers Watson (vol. 26, no. 2, February 2016), only 20 percent of Fortune 
500 companies offered a defined-benefit plan to salaried new hires in 2015, down from 59 percent among 
the same employers in 1998.

the responsible provision of loans to some individuals and firms that otherwise would not 

have access to such credit.  In recent years, some innovative Community Development 

Financial Institutions (CDFIs) have developed partnerships with online alternative 

lenders, with the goal of expanding credit access to underserved small businesses.7   

The challenge will be to foster socially beneficial innovation that responsibly 

expands access to credit for underserved consumers and small businesses, and those who 

otherwise would qualify only for high-cost alternatives.  It would be a lost opportunity if, 

instead of expanding access in a socially beneficial way, some fintech products merely 

provided a vehicle to market high-cost loans to the underserved, or resulted in the digital 

equivalent of redlining, exacerbating rather than ameliorating financial access inequities.   

We are also monitoring a growing fintech segment called “regtech” that aims to 

help banks achieve regulatory compliance more effectively.  Regtech firms are designing 

new tools to assist banks and other financial institutions in addressing regulatory 

compliance issues ranging from onboarding new customers to consumer protection to 

payments and governance.  Many of the current solutions are focused on Bank Secrecy 

Act (BSA) regulatory requirements, including know-your-customer (KYC) and 

suspicious activity reporting requirements.  The solutions utilize new technologies and 

data-analytic techniques that may reduce the costs and time needed for banks to identify 

and assess customers’ money-laundering and terrorist-financing risks.  However, it is too 

                                                 
7 Most recently, Regions Bank announced a partnership with Fundation, an online lender, and TruFund, a 
CDFI, to provide small-dollar loans to underserved small businesses (for more information, see 
http://ir.regions.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=989068).  In 2015, Lending Club and the Opportunity 
Fund, a California-based CDFI, announced a partnership intended to provide $10 million in loans over a 
period of five months to 400 small businesses in underserved areas of California (for more information, see

lending-club).

early to tell the degree to which innovative approaches to customer due diligence, such as 

KYC utilities, will deliver efficiency gains such as those outlined in the recent Bank for 

International Settlements Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures report on 

correspondent banking.8 

Ensuring Risks Are Managed and Consumers Are Protected 

While financial innovation holds promise, it is crucial that financial firms, 

customers, regulators, and other stakeholders understand and mitigate associated risks.  

There is a tension between the lightning pace of development of new products and 

services being brought to market--sometimes by firms that are new or have not 

historically specialized in consumer finance--and the duty to ensure that important risks 

around financial services and payments are addressed.  Firms need to ensure that they are 

appropriately controlling and mitigating both risks that are unique to fintech as well as 

risks that exist independently of new technologies.   

For example, some fintech firms are exploring the use of nontraditional data in 

underwriting and pricing credit products.  While nontraditional data may have the 

potential to help evaluate consumers who lack credit histories, some data may raise 

consumer protection concerns.  Nontraditional data, such as the level of education and 

social media usage, may not necessarily have a broadly agreed upon or empirically 

established nexus with creditworthiness and may be correlated with characteristics 

protected by fair lending laws.  To the extent that the use of this type of data could result 

in unfairly disadvantaging some groups of consumers, it requires careful review to ensure 

legal compliance.  In addition, while consumers generally have some sense of how their

financial behavior affects their traditional credit scores, alternative credit scoring methods 

present new challenges that could raise questions of fairness and transparency.  It may 

not always be readily apparent to consumers, or even to regulators, what specific 

information is utilized by certain alternative credit scoring systems, how such use impacts 

a consumer’s ability to secure a loan or its pricing, and what behavioral changes 

consumers might take to improve their credit access and pricing. 

Similarly, fintech innovations that rely on data sharing may create security, 

privacy, and data-ownership risks, even as they provide increased convenience to 

consumers.  Recent examples of large-scale fraud and cybersecurity breaches have 

illustrated the significance of possible security risks.  As the data sets that financial 

institutions utilize expand beyond traditional consumer credit histories, data privacy will 

become a growing concern, as will data ownership and whether or not the consumer has 

any say over how these data are used and shared or whether he or she can review it for 

accuracy.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently issued a request for 

information to better understand the benefits and risks associated with new financial services 

that rely on access to consumer financial accounts and account-related information.9 

In addition to the risks I have outlined that are specific to new financial 

technologies, firms also must control for risks that have always been present, even in 

brick-and-mortar financial institutions.  For example, risks around the BSA and Anti-

Money Laundering rules cut across all segments and all portfolios.  Similarly, firms must 

                                                 
9 See 
http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/112016_cfpb_Request_for_Information_Regarding_Consum
er_Access_to_Financial_Records.pdf.  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau believes that 
“consumers should be able to use their financial records and account information and securely share access 
in an electronic format.”

monitor credit and liquidity risks of loans acquired or processed via fintech platforms, 

especially given that these products have not been tested over an economic cycle.   

Furthermore, as a general rule, the introduction of new products or services 

typically involves heightened risks as a financial institution enters into new areas with 

which it may not have experience or that may not be consistent with its overall business 

strategy and risk tolerance.  Banks collaborating with fintech firms must control for the 

risks associated with the associated new products, services, and third-party relationships. 

When incorporating innovation that is consistent with a bank’s goals and risk tolerance, 

bankers will need to consider which model of engagement is most appropriate in light of 

their business model and risk-management infrastructure, manage any outsourced 

relationships consistent with supervisory expectations,10 ensure that regulatory 

compliance considerations are included in the development of new products and services, 

and have strong fallback plans in place to limit the risks associated with products and 

partners that may not survive.  

With the growing number of partnerships between banks and fintech companies, 

we often receive questions about the applicability of our vendor risk-management 

guidance.  We are actively reviewing our guidance to determine whether any adjustments 

or clarifications may become appropriate in the context of these arrangements.  We hear 

concerns from community bankers in particular about their internal capacity to undertake 

the requisite due diligence and ongoing vendor management on their own, especially with 

much larger vendors, and questions about whether the interagency service providers 

supervision program might be relevant in this context.  We are thinking about whether

Outsourcing Risk,” www.federalreserve.gov/bankinforeg/srletters/sr1319.htm.

changes brought about by fintech and fintech partnerships may warrant consideration of 

any changes to the interagency supervision program for service providers. 

Regulatory Engagement 

I believe that the Federal Reserve is well-positioned to help shape this innovation 

as it develops, and it is important that we be clear about our expectations and mindful of 

the possible effects of our actions.  The policy, regulatory, and supervisory decisions 

made by the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators can impact the ways in which 

new financial technologies are developed and implemented, and ultimately how effective 

they are.  It is critical that fintech firms and financial institutions comply with all 

applicable legal protections and obligations.  At the same time, it is important that 

regulators and supervisors not impose undue burdens on financial innovations that would 

provide broad social benefits responsibly.  An unduly rigid regulatory or supervisory 

posture could lead to unintended consequences, such as the movement of innovations 

outside of the regulated banking industry, potentially creating greater risks and less 

transparency. 

The rapid pace of change and the large number of actors--both banks and 

nonbanks--in fintech raise questions about how to effectively conduct our regulatory and 

supervisory activities.  In one sense, regulators’ approach to fintech should be no 

different than for conventional financial products or services.  The same basic principles 

regarding fairness and transparency should apply regardless of whether a consumer 

obtains a product through a brick-and-mortar bank branch or an online portal using a 

smartphone.  Indeed, the same consumer laws and regulations that apply to products 

offered by banks generally apply to nonbank fintech firms as well, even though their 


 - 9 - 

business models may differ.  However, the application of laws and regulations that were 

designed based on traditional financial products and delivery channels may give rise to 

complex or novel issues when applied to new products or new delivery channels.  As a 

result, we are committed to regularly engage with firms and the technology to develop a 

shared understanding of these issues as they evolve. 

Fundamentally, financial institutions themselves are responsible for providing 

innovative financial services safely.  Financial services firms must pair technological 

know-how and innovative services with a strong compliance culture and a thorough 

knowledge of the important legal and compliance guardrails.  While “run fast and break 

things” may be a popular mantra in the technology space, it is ill-suited to an arena that 

depends on trust and confidence.  New entrants need to understand that the financial 

arena is a carefully regulated space with a compelling rationale underlying the various 

rules at play, even if these are likely to evolve over time.  There is more at stake in the 

realm of financial services than in some other areas of technological innovation.  There 

are more serious and lasting consequences for a consumer who gets, for instance, an 

unsustainable loan on his or her smartphone than for a consumer who downloads the 

wrong movie or listens to a bad podcast.  At the same time, regulators may need to revisit 

processes designed for a brick-and-mortar world when approaching digital finance.  To 

ensure that fintech realizes its positive potential, regulators and firms alike should take a 

long view, with thoughtful engagement on both sides. 

When we look back at times of financial crisis or missteps, we frequently find that 

a key cause was elevating short-term profitability over long-term sustainability and 

consumer welfare.  It was not long ago that so-called exotic mortgages originally 


 - 10 - 

designed for niche borrowers became increasingly marketed to low- and moderate-

income borrowers who could not sustain them, ultimately with disastrous results.  In 

addition to the financial consequences for individual consumers, the drive for 

unsustainable profit can contribute to distrust in the financial system, which is 

detrimental to the broader economy.  It is critical that firms providing financial services 

consider the long-term social benefit of the products and services they offer.  Concerns 

regarding long-term sustainability are magnified in situations where banks may bear 

credit or other longer-term operational risks related to products delivered by a fintech 

firm.  One useful question to ask is whether a product’s success depends on consumers 

making ill-informed choices; if so, or if the product otherwise fails to provide sufficient 

value to consumers, it is not going to be seen as responsible and may not prove 

sustainable over time.   

The key challenge for regulatory agencies is to create the right balance. 

Ultimately, regulators should be prepared to appropriately tailor regulatory or supervisory 

expectations, to the extent possible within our respective authorities, to facilitate fintech 

innovations that produce benefits for consumers, businesses, and the financial system.  At 

the same time, any contemplated adjustments must also appropriately manage 

corresponding risks.    

Federal Reserve Fintech Engagement 

To better understand technological changes in lending, payments, and other areas, 

the Federal Reserve has been engaging with a wide range of market participants to 

understand barriers to socially beneficial innovations.  Our unique structure, with Board 

and Reserve Bank staff in over 30 locations, allows us to tap expertise in markets and 


 - 11 - 

innovation centers across the country to help establish channels of communication, 

including with nonbank participants with whom we may not otherwise have regular 

contact. 

 The Federal Reserve also engages in ongoing communication with other 

regulators to promote, to the greatest extent possible, consistency in approaches and 

alignment of supervisory requirements.  Exchanging ideas and discussing fintech 

innovations with other regulators is critical to understanding and vetting risks and, where 

appropriate, reaching consistent views regarding the application of laws, regulations, or 

guidance.  

Finally, we recognize the value of technical expertise.  With fintech, as with any 

other emerging financial product or service, the Federal Reserve is learning as much as 

we can to ensure that we have a robust understanding of the technologies and activities in 

which banks and other financial firms are engaging, and to inform the development of 

our policy and supervisory approaches.  To that end, the Federal Reserve Board has 

established a multidisciplinary working group that is engaged in a 360-degree analysis of 

fintech innovation.  We are bringing together the best thinking across the Federal Reserve 

System, spanning key areas of responsibility--from supervision to community 

development, from financial stability to payments--to assess the impact of technological 

development on the Federal Reserve’s responsibilities.  As part of this effort, Federal 

Reserve senior officials and staff have been closely watching developments in fintech, 

evaluating its impact on financial services delivery, and assessing the policy and 

supervisory implications in this arena.

Conclusion 

Current developments in the digitization of finance, including the establishment 

of new business models, are important and deserving of serious engagement on the part 

of policymakers and regulators.  As policymakers, we want to facilitate innovation where 

it has the potential to yield broad social benefit, while ensuring that risks are thoroughly 

managed.  In safeguarding the public interest, the first line of analysis and protection will 

always rest with the market participants closest to the new technologies and product 

innovations and to the organizations that consider adopting them.  But regulators also 

should seek to analyze the implications of technology developments through constructive 

and timely engagement.  We should be attentive to the potential social benefits of these 

new technologies, prepared to make the necessary regulatory adjustments if their safety 

and integrity are proven and their potential benefits found to be in the public interest, and 

vigilant to ensure risks are well understood and managed.
