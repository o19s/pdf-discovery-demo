I would like to thank the Banque de France for inviting me to take part in what I 

expect will be a lively discussion. 

The suddenness and severity of the global financial crisis forced policymakers to 

respond rapidly and creatively, employing a wide range of macroeconomic tools--

including both monetary and fiscal policies--to arrest a steep economic downturn and 

restart the global economy.  Given the slow and unsteady nature of the recovery, 

supportive policy remains necessary. 

Today I would like to briefly review the evolution of monetary and fiscal policies 

following the global financial crisis both in the United States and in other advanced 

economies, since we have faced similar experiences and employed similar policy 

responses.  I will try to draw some lessons and provide some thoughts on the policy mix 

going forward. 

Policy before the Crisis 

 Prior to the global financial crisis, inflation rates in the United States and other 

advanced economies were near their target levels and most of these economies appeared 

to be operating close to their potential.  Policy interest rates were similarly in the vicinity 

of levels considered to be normal.   

Fiscal deficits also appeared to be under control before the crisis.  According to 

the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), general 

government deficits in 2007 were less than 4 percent of GDP in the United States and the 

United Kingdom, about 2 percent in Japan, and less than 1 percent, on average, in the 

euro area.  Still, given relatively buoyant economic conditions, governments probably 

should have been doing more to prepare for the long-term challenge of aging populations,

which will boost pension obligations and health-care expenditures in coming years.  

Moreover, government debt levels were already high in Japan and in some European 

economies and not particularly low elsewhere.  In addition, some euro-area countries that 

appeared to have strong fiscal positions going into the crisis depended partly on revenue 

from housing booms that soon went bust.   

The Policy Response to the Crisis 

 When the crisis hit, its global scope and severity were exceptional.  Central banks 

in the United States and other countries responded by rapidly and sharply reducing their 

policy interest rates, lowering them in many cases to near zero.  In addition, in their role 

as lenders of last resort, central banks acted rapidly to provide liquidity to help stabilize 

the financial system and support the flow of credit to households and businesses, in some 

cases creating new lending facilities.  These extraordinary and creative responses showed 

that monetary policymakers had internalized the lessons of the Great Depression. 

Initially, fiscal policy also provided significant stimulus.  A portion of this 

stimulus reflected the operation of automatic stabilizers--higher unemployment benefits, 

for example, and a decline in tax payments due to lower incomes--and some came 

through cuts in tax rates and increases in discretionary spending.  Expansive fiscal policy 

served to raise deficits in most countries, some of which faced further costs from 

stabilizing financial institutions, pushing deficits even higher.  Sharp increases in deficits 

led in turn to escalating levels of government debt.   

Policy during the Recovery 

 The combination of increasing debt and depressed output led to rising ratios of 

debt to gross domestic product (GDP) in many advanced economies and heightened 

concern about whether the growth in debt could be sustained without unsettling financial

markets.  As a result, early in the recovery governments began to withdraw fiscal 

stimulus, and, in most cases, fiscal policy became a net drag on economic growth.  This 

outcome was most evident in the euro-area periphery, where skyrocketing bond yields 

and deepening concerns about default left governments with little choice about whether 

to rein in stimulus.  In Spain, for example, the OECD estimates that fiscal consolidation 

has subtracted an average of 1-1/2 percentage points from GDP growth each year since 

2009.  But fiscal policy also turned contractionary in countries facing less market 

pressure, such as the United Kingdom and the United States.  Governments in both 

countries embarked on fiscal consolidation programs over the past four years, sharply 

reducing their structural deficits, and, as a consequence, creating headwinds that slowed 

the recovery.  

 With fiscal drag weighing on growth and with private-sector deleveraging also 

holding back consumption and investment, monetary policy bore the brunt of supporting 

the economy.  With policy rates at or approaching zero, central banks of necessity turned 

to unconventional policy tools such as large-scale asset purchases and enhanced forward 

guidance about the future path of policy rates.  These unconventional tools have, in my 

view, served to support a recovery in domestic demand and, as a consequence, global 

economic growth. 

Even so, the recovery in most advanced nations has proceeded more slowly than 

policymakers would have hoped.  This sluggishness has been due in part to the severity 

of the financial shock associated with the crisis and the persistent headwinds to recovery 

in its aftermath.  But the lack of fiscal support for demand in recent years also helps 




- 4 - 
 

account for the weakness of this recovery compared with past recoveries.1  In the United 

States, fiscal policy has been much less supportive relative to previous recoveries.  For 

instance, at a comparable point in the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment at 

all levels of government had increased by about 800,000 workers; in contrast, in the 

current recovery, government employment has declined by about 650,000 jobs. 

Lessons 

 What lessons can we draw from this experience?  The first is that governments 

need to address long-term challenges and significantly improve their structural fiscal 

balances during good times so they have more fiscal space to provide stimulus when 

times turn bad.  When poor economic conditions drive policy interest rates close to the 

zero lower bound, fiscal stimulus may be more effective than usual in boosting aggregate 

demand because it will not have the usual effect of raising real interest rates, thereby 

crowding out private demand.2  

A second lesson is that, while even if it is appropriate for fiscal policy to play a 

larger role when policy rates are near zero, policymakers nevertheless may face 

constraints in implementing fiscal stimulus.  This means that central banks need to be 

prepared to employ all available tools, including unconventional policies, to support 

economic growth and to reach their inflation targets.

A third critical lesson pertains to the importance of having a sound and resilient 

financial sector with strong capitalization and prudent risk management, supported by 

effective regulation and supervision.  The recent crisis has appropriately increased the 

focus on financial stability at central banks around the world.  At the European Central 

Bank (ECB), the recent comprehensive assessment is an important step toward building 

confidence in euro-area banks.  I wish the ECB great success as it takes on its new 

responsibilities at the center of the single supervisory mechanism.  At the Federal 

Reserve, we have devoted substantially increased resources to monitoring financial 

stability and have refocused our regulatory and supervisory efforts to limit the buildup of 

systemic risk.  This macroprudential approach to promoting financial stability will be an 

important complement to our other tools for promoting a healthy economy.   

Looking Ahead 

In advanced economies, the current macroeconomic policy mix generally remains 

one of extraordinary monetary policy stimulus and somewhat contractionary fiscal 

policy.  Considering the headwinds that continue to weigh on growth, employment, and 

prices, this situation is hardly ideal.  Policymakers face difficult choices as they seek to 

balance the need for long-term fiscal sustainability with the need to support their 

economies in the near term.   

Even so, I continue to anticipate that the headwinds associated with the financial 

crisis will wane.  As employment, economic activity, and inflation rates return to normal, 

monetary policy will eventually need to normalize too, although the speed and timing of 

this normalization will likely differ across countries based on differences in the pace of 

recovery in domestic conditions.  This normalization could lead to some heightened 

financial volatility.  But as I have noted on other occasions, for our part, the Federal 




- 6 - 
 

Reserve will strive to clearly and transparently communicate its monetary policy strategy 

in order to minimize the likelihood of surprises that could disrupt financial markets, both 

at home and around the world.  More importantly, the normalization of monetary policy 

will be an important sign that economic conditions more generally are finally emerging 

from the shadow of the Great Recession.
