It’s nice to be back at Princeton.  I find it difficult to believe that it’s been almost 

11 years since I departed these halls for Washington.  I wrote recently to inquire about 

the status of my leave from the university, and the letter I got back began, “Regrettably, 

Princeton receives many more qualified applicants for faculty positions than we can 

accommodate.”1 

I’ll extend my best wishes to the seniors later, but first I want to congratulate the 

parents and families here.  As a parent myself, I know that putting your kid through 

college these days is no walk in the park.  Some years ago I had a colleague who sent 

three kids through Princeton even though neither he nor his wife attended this university.  

He and his spouse were very proud of that accomplishment, as they should have been.  

But my colleague also used to say that, from a financial perspective, the experience was 

like buying a new Cadillac every year and then driving it off a cliff.  I should say that he 

always added that he would do it all over again in a minute.  So, well done, moms, dads, 

and families. 

This is indeed an impressive and appropriate setting for a commencement.  I am 

sure that, from this lectern, any number of distinguished spiritual leaders have ruminated 

on the lessons of the Ten Commandments.  I don’t have that kind of confidence, and, 

anyway, coveting your neighbor’s ox or donkey is not the problem it used to be, so I 

thought I would use my few minutes today to make Ten Suggestions, or maybe just Ten 

Observations, about the world and your lives after Princeton.  Please note, these points 

have nothing whatsoever to do with interest rates.  My qualification for making such 

suggestions, or observations, besides having kindly been invited to speak today by 

President Tilghman, is the same as the reason that your obnoxious brother or sister got to 
                                                 
1 Note to journalists:  This is a joke.  My leave from Princeton expired in 2005. 


 - 2 - 

go to bed later--I am older than you.  All of what follows has been road-tested in real-life 

situations, but past performance is no guarantee of future results.  


1. The poet Robert Burns once said something about the best-laid plans of mice 

and men ganging aft agley, whatever “agley” means.  A more contemporary 

philosopher, Forrest Gump, said something similar about life and boxes of 

chocolates and not knowing what you are going to get.  They were both right.  

Life is amazingly unpredictable; any 22-year-old who thinks he or she knows 

where they will be in 10 years, much less in 30, is simply lacking imagination.  

Look what happened to me:  A dozen years ago I was minding my own 

business teaching Economics 101 in Alexander Hall and trying to think of 

good excuses for avoiding faculty meetings.  Then I got a phone call . . .   In 

case you are skeptical of Forrest Gump’s insight, here’s a concrete suggestion 

for each of the graduating seniors.  Take a few minutes the first chance you 

get and talk to an alum participating in his or her 25th, or 30th, or 40th 

reunion--you know, somebody who was near the front of the P-rade.  Ask 

them, back when they were graduating 25, 30, or 40 years ago, where they 

expected to be today.  If you can get them to open up, they will tell you that 

today they are happy and satisfied in various measures, or not, and their 

personal stories will be filled with highs and lows and in-betweens.  But, I am 

willing to bet, those life stories will in almost all cases be quite different, in 

large and small ways, from what they expected when they started out.  This is 


 - 3 - 

a good thing, not a bad thing; who wants to know the end of a story that’s only 

in its early chapters?  Don’t be afraid to let the drama play out. 


2. Does the fact that our lives are so influenced by chance and seemingly small 

decisions and actions mean that there is no point to planning, to striving?  Not 

at all.  Whatever life may have in store for you, each of you has a grand, 

lifelong project, and that is the development of yourself as a human being.  

Your family and friends and your time at Princeton have given you a good 

start.  What will you do with it?  Will you keep learning and thinking hard and 

critically about the most important questions?  Will you become an 

emotionally stronger person, more generous, more loving, more ethical?  Will 

you involve yourself actively and constructively in the world?  Many things 

will happen in your lives, pleasant and not so pleasant, but, paraphrasing a 

Woodrow Wilson School adage from the time I was here, “Wherever you go, 

there you are.”  If you are not happy with yourself, even the loftiest 

achievements won’t bring you much satisfaction. 


3. The concept of success leads me to consider so-called meritocracies and their 

implications.  We have been taught that meritocratic institutions and societies 

are fair.  Putting aside the reality that no system, including our own, is really 

entirely meritocratic, meritocracies may be fairer and more efficient than 

some alternatives.  But fair in an absolute sense?  Think about it.  A 

meritocracy is a system in which the people who are the luckiest in their 


 - 4 - 

health and genetic endowment; luckiest in terms of family support, 

encouragement, and, probably, income; luckiest in their educational and 

career opportunities; and luckiest in so many other ways difficult to 

enumerate--these are the folks who reap the largest rewards.  The only way for 

even a putative meritocracy to hope to pass ethical muster, to be considered 

fair, is if those who are the luckiest in all of those respects also have the 

greatest responsibility to work hard, to contribute to the betterment of the 

world, and to share their luck with others.  As the Gospel of Luke says (and I 

am sure my rabbi will forgive me for quoting the New Testament in a good 

cause):  “From everyone to whom much has been given, much will be 

required; and from the one to whom much has been entrusted, even more will 

be demanded” (Luke 12:48, New Revised Standard Version Bible).  Kind of 

grading on the curve, you might say. 


4. Who is worthy of admiration?  Luke’s admonition--which is shared by most 

ethical and philosophical traditions, by the way--helps with this question as 

well.  Those most worthy of admiration are those who have made the best use 

of their advantages or, alternatively, coped most courageously with their 

adversities.  I think most of us would agree that people who have, say, little 

formal schooling but labor honestly and diligently to help feed, clothe, and 

educate their families are deserving of greater respect--and help, if necessary--

than many people who are superficially more successful.  They’re more fun to 

have a beer with, too.  That is all you need to know about sociology. 


 - 5 - 


5. Since I have covered sociology, I might as well cover political science as well.  

In regard to politics, I have always liked Lily Tomlin’s line, in paraphrase:  “I 

try to be cynical, but I just can’t keep up.”  We all feel that way some time.  

Actually, having been in Washington now for almost 11 years, as I mentioned, 

I feel that way quite a bit.  Ultimately, though, cynicism is a poor substitute 

for critical thought and constructive action.  Sure, interests and money and 

ideology all matter, as you learned in political science.  But my experience is 

that most of our politicians and policymakers are trying to do the right thing, 

according to their own consciences, most of the time.  If you think that the bad 

or indifferent results that too often come out of Washington are due to base 

motives and bad intentions, you are giving politicians and policymakers way 

too much credit for being effective.  Honest error in the face of complex and 

possibly intractable problems is a far more important source of bad results 

than are bad motives.  For these reasons, the greatest forces in Washington are 

ideas, and people prepared to act on those ideas.  Public service isn’t easy.  

But, in the end, if you are inclined in that direction, it is a worthy and 

challenging pursuit. 


6. Having given you the essence of sociology and political science, let me wrap 

up economics while I’m at it.  Economics is a highly sophisticated field of 

thought that is superb at explaining to policymakers precisely why the choices 

they made in the past were wrong.  About the future, not so much.  However, 


 - 6 - 

careful economic analysis does have one important benefit, which is that it 

can help kill ideas that are completely logically inconsistent or wildly at 

variance with the data.  This insight covers at least 90 percent of proposed 

economic policies. 

 
7. I’m not going to tell you that money doesn’t matter, because you wouldn’t 

believe me anyway.  In fact, for too many people around the world, money is 

literally a life-or-death proposition.  But if you are part of the lucky minority 

with the ability to choose, remember that money is a means, not an end.  A 

career decision based only on money and not on love of the work or a desire 

to make a difference is a recipe for unhappiness.  

 
8. Nobody likes to fail but failure is an essential part of life and of learning.  If 

your uniform isn’t dirty, you haven’t been in the game. 


9. I spoke earlier about definitions of personal success in an unpredictable world.  

I hope that as you develop your own definition of success, you will be able to 

do so, if you wish, with a close companion on your journey.  In making that 

choice, remember that physical beauty is evolution’s way of assuring us that 

the other person doesn’t have too many intestinal parasites.  Don’t get me 

wrong, I am all for beauty, romance, and sexual attraction--where would 

Hollywood and Madison Avenue be without them?  But while important, 

those are not the only things to look for in a partner.  The two of you will have 

a long trip together, I hope, and you will need each other’s support and 


 - 7 - 

sympathy more times than you can count.  Speaking as somebody who has 

been happily married for 35 years, I can’t imagine any choice more 

consequential for a lifelong journey than the choice of a traveling companion. 

 
 
10.  Call your mom and dad once in a while.  A time will come when you will 

want your own grown-up, busy, hyper-successful children to call you.  Also, 

remember who paid your tuition to Princeton. 


Those are my suggestions.   They’re probably worth exactly what you paid for 

them.  But they come from someone who shares your affection for this great institution 

and who wishes you the best for the future. 

Congratulations, graduates.  Give ’em hell.
