I want to thank Ben Dulchin and the Association of Neighborhood and Housing 

Development (ANHD) for inviting me to be here with you today.  While New York is known 

globally as a cultural hub that attracts the world to its doorstep, it is known locally as a city of 

neighborhoods.  Like other cities across this country, New York’s future is bound to the vitality 

of its neighborhoods as places to live, work, learn, play, worship, and invest.1   

Neighborhoods have been the focus of ANHD’s work for over 40 years.  The 

organization’s success is a function of its unwavering focus on preserving and strengthening the 

quality of life in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods across the five boroughs.  The 

mission of each of the members of ANHD is to strengthen these communities.  Together, your 

organizations are providing capacity building, advocacy, and services for the benefit of your 

communities and the city as a whole.   

Like many of the nation’s metropolitan areas, New York City has rebounded since the 

recession and is thriving.2  That, however, has not been the experience for many.  Many of the 

city’s residents have not fully recovered, and some have fallen further behind.  Here, as 

elsewhere in the country, there remain important gaps in economic opportunity.   

Powerful research now demonstrates that persistent gaps in economic opportunity are 

connected to the health of neighborhoods.  The effects of place on opportunity can stretch from 

one generation to the next.  Raj Chetty and others have shown that upward mobility can vary 

immensely by neighborhood even within the same metropolitan area.  The longer a child lives in 

                                                           
1 I am grateful to Theresa Stark of the Federal Reserve Board for her assistance in preparing these remarks. The 
remarks represent my own views, which do not necessarily represent those of the Federal Reserve Board or the 
Federal Open Market Committee.  
2According to the most recent report by the New York City Comptroller, the city’s GDP grew 2.7 percent in the first 
quarter of 2018 as compared to 2.3 percent for the nation, and the unemployment rate for the city fell to 4.3 percent, 
the lowest rate on record. See “NYC Economic Growth Slows Down, but Still Surpasses the Nation,”

a neighborhood of opportunity--a neighborhood  that is racially integrated and has a strong 

middle class, strong family structures, more social capital, and better schools--the more likely 

that a child will do better than their parents economically in adulthood and navigating a path of 

upward mobility.3   

As I have noted previously, these disparities matter for growth and prosperity.  If there 

are large disparities in opportunity, such that enterprise, exertion, and investments reap lower 

returns in some communities than others, then families and small businesses in these 

communities will invest less in the future, and potential growth will fall short.4  Although there 

are important implications at the national level for growth and prosperity, to the extent that the 

roots of the disparities in opportunity and mobility lie in local communities, an important part of 

the solution is likely to be investments in those communities.5 

The Community Reinvestment Act 

That one powerful insight--the importance of investment in communities--lies at the heart 

of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA).  The CRA is one of the principal tools the Congress 

has provided for improving investment and development in lower-income communities.  

Implementing this law effectively is one of the important responsibilities of the banking agencies 

in promoting strong outcomes locally that reverberate nationally.  So let me turn to the role of the 

CRA in supporting local efforts to strengthen low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and

inequality is associated with lower long-term growth and with lower income growth. See, for example, Heather

offer my preliminary thoughts on the opportunity before us to make the regulations even more 

effective in this regard.    

The CRA was enacted in 1977 to combat the legacy of redlining--literally, the 

demarcation in red ink of neighborhoods deemed too risky for lending.  Federal lending agencies 

used these redlined maps in deciding where to guarantee mortgage loans.6  Not surprisingly, the 

resulting deprivation of credit stifled opportunity for the people living in these areas.   

Through the CRA, Congress requires the federal banking agencies to encourage banks 

and thrifts to help meet the credit needs of the communities they are chartered to serve, including 

low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safety and soundness. It requires the 

Federal Reserve and other agencies to evaluate how well banking institutions help meet those 

needs and to assign ratings to their performance.7  The CRA further requires the agencies to 

make public both the ratings and their written evaluations of the banks’ performance.  This 

transparency provides an incentive for banks to work with their communities to meet the needs 

of low- and moderate-income members and provides important information to enable community 

members to engage meaningfully with banks.   

Research has demonstrated that the CRA has had a positive effect on low- and moderate- 

income neighborhoods.8  The CRA is unique in that it puts decisionmaking about the 

6 See http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/10/housing-discrimination-redlining-maps/ for details about how 
maps created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation in the 1930s were used to designate areas considered 
hazardous for mortgage lending and influenced whether mortgage loans qualified for government guarantees from 
the Federal Housing Administration. To view interactive historical maps, see

compliance. 
8 CRA-related mortgage loans had delinquency rates lower than the average across all 2006-vintage mortgages and 
sharply lower than those of subprime loans; see Neil Bhutta, and Glenn B. Canner, “Mortgage Market Conditions 
and Borrower Outcomes: Evidence from the 2012 HMDA Data and Matched HMDA-Credit Record Data,” Federal 
Reserve Bulletin 99 (November 2013).  In addition, a study of mortgage loans originated between 2003 and 2006 as 
part of a CRA targeted, low- to moderate-income homebuyer program found that they performed nearly as well as

community’s needs and priorities in the hands of local stakeholders:  financial institutions that 

lend and invest, community organizations that deliver services and develop real estate, and state 

and local governments that direct incentives and subsidies.  The enactment of other laws around 

the same time supported the CRA’s success, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, 

which requires lenders to report the location of their home mortgage lending and the race and 

income of borrowers.   

Much has changed in the years since the CRA was enacted, including technology-driven 

changes in the delivery of financial services, and it is high time to consider corresponding 

improvements to the regulations.  Both banks and community organizations have offered a 

variety of suggestions for improving the CRA regulations and their implementation in the last 

several years.  We are undertaking discussions with the Office of the Comptroller of the 

Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, with which we have traditionally 

issued joint rulemakings on the CRA.  The Federal Reserve has long been interested in engaging 

in an interagency review of the CRA regulations, so we are pleased to participate in this process.  

In addition, the Treasury Department recently completed an extensive outreach effort related to 

modernizing the CRA regulations.   

CRA is a vital tool to address the credit needs of low- and moderate-income 

communities, and I believe the time is ripe for a refresh to make it even more relevant to today’s 

challenges.  There are five principles that can help guide our efforts.  


                                                           
prime loans and much better than subprime mortgage loans through the financial crisis; see Lei Ding, Roberto G. 
Quercia, Janneke Ratcliffe, and Wei Lei, “Risky Borrowers or Risky Mortgages: Disaggregating Effects Using 
Propensity Score Models,” Journal of Real Estate Research 33 no. 2 (2011): 245–77. Another analysis found 
evidence of a substantial increase in mortgage lending due to the CRA--especially among low-income borrowers--
with no measurable rise in the likelihood of default; see Daniel Ringo, “Mortgage Lending, Default, and the 
Community Reinvestment Act,” June 15, 2017.

The Importance of Place   

 First, we should update the area in which the agencies assess a bank’s CRA activities 

while retaining the core focus on place.  This is the most important aspect of refreshing the CRA, 

and also the one that will require the most care.  As our Federal Advisory Council noted, “…a 

bank’s ability to engage in meaningful community development efforts continues to require a 

meaningful knowledge of and presence in local communities.”9  A significant strength of CRA 

evaluations is that a bank’s performance is evaluated taking into account the demographics of its 

communities, the types of housing and businesses they serve, and the other financial institutions 

serving those communities.   

The current regulations use branches and deposit-taking ATMs as a proxy for the 

communities the bank serves because these were the primary mechanisms for delivering services 

when the CRA was enacted and for many years subsequently.  This reflected an environment 

where interstate banking was not allowed, and physical branches were necessary for deposit 

taking and lending.  Today, changes in technology and consumer preferences have made it 

possible for banks to serve customers far beyond their physical branches and deposit-taking 

ATMs--via online and mobile platforms.  

Even so, as much as technology has made banking transactions more convenient for 

customers, it has not eliminated the need for branches.  For large parts of the country, branches 

and deposit-taking ATMs remain an important way that banks engage with a community.  

Branches and ATMs are still necessary for depositing and withdrawing cash.  Branches also 

provide personal service and assistance to consumers and business customers. They provide a

presence for lenders to get to know borrowers and the communities in which they live, lend, and 

invest.  As our Community Advisory Council recently emphasized, “[f]or many rural and LMI 

populations, bank branches remain critical for the provision of bank loans, investments, and 

services.”10  

Recent studies measuring the impact of branch closures on credit availability in 

neighborhoods demonstrate that branches still matter, particularly with respect to accessing small 

business credit.11 The Federal Reserve Bank of New York found that access to small business 

credit declines and the rates for small business loans increase as the distance between the bank 

and the borrower grows.12  Similarly, the large majority of mortgage lending continues to be 

located in one or more of a bank’s delineated assessment areas--that is, near a physical branch.   

This research also found that people in low-income census tracts were more than twice as 

likely to live in a banking desert--an area without a branch within 10 miles--than those in higher-

income tracts.13  When they are cut off from mainstream banking institutions, some consumers 

rely on more expensive alternatives that include payday loans, auto title loans, pawn shops, and 

check cashing services. 

 Banks vary widely in terms of the types of services they offer and the mechanisms they 

use for reaching their customers.  On one end of the spectrum, many community banks still rely

11 See Hoai-Luu Q. Nguyen, Do Bank Branches Still Matter? The Effect of Closings on Local Economic Outcomes, 
October 2015. The reason is the information-intensive nature of the underwriting process. Even in areas with plenty 
of bank branches, declines in small businesses lending because of the loss of the relationship between a small 
business owner and their loan officer were significant.  Once broken, the study found that those relationships take 
years to replace. The impact of branch closures were found to be more severe in tracts with lower median income, a 
higher fraction of minority households, and where firms were, on average, closer to their lending.

tracts that were also banking deserts increased 0.17 percentage points compared to a 0.06 percentage point increase 
in higher-income tracts.

primarily on branches and ATMs to reach their customers, with mobile functionality offered 

primarily to enhance the customer experience.  In the middle of the spectrum, regional and 

national banking organizations are using online and mobile app capabilities to attract and retain 

customers well beyond their physical footprint.  At the other end of the spectrum, online banks 

employ business models that reach customers across much or all of America without relying on 

branches.  Although these online banks may provide the same retail products and services as a 

traditional bank with a branch network, because they have only one location, they are evaluated 

for CRA purposes in the area around that location, rather than in the many areas where they have 

customers.    

Still other banks offer a limited set of credit products or wholesale services. Take, for 

instance, the example of Industrial Loan Companies (ILCs), which have CRA obligations as 

state-chartered insured depository institutions.  ILCs are owned by corporations rather than bank 

holding companies and are typically chartered to provide credit cards or other forms of financing 

related to their parent company’s business.  Many large ILCs are chartered in Utah and are 

evaluated on their CRA performance in Salt Lake City, even though they lend nationally.  The 

result is a saturated market for community development lending and investment in Salt Lake 

City.  At the same time, other areas in Utah and beyond have important community development 

opportunities that may go unmet.  At a minimum, revised CRA regulations should allow banks 

with this type of business model to expand CRA activities beyond the area surrounding its 

branch so that the community and economic development needs of more underserved 

communities can be met.  

Branches are important vehicles for reaching small business customers and low-income 

consumers, but they are not the only way.  In considering ways to revise the CRA regulations, 


-7- 
 


the agencies should be thoughtful about how to make the areas in which we evaluate CRA 

performance more meaningful to both banks and low- and moderate-income communities.  For 

community banks that rely on branches to serve their customers, the current assessment area 

approach may need only small adjustments.  For banks that serve their customers through a 

variety of approaches, assessing their broader deposit-taking and loan-making footprint might 

make sense. For large wholesale banks, it might make sense to evaluate CRA activity in a 

broader area and to encourage them to spread their investments and services to underserved 

areas.   

The CRA regulations should be updated in a way that is appropriate for different business 

models.  To the extent that banks are able to serve the needs in low- and moderate-income 

communities through additional channels, it is important they receive due consideration, while 

CRA revisions should also continue to recognize the importance of sustaining branches in 

communities where they are needed.   

Opportunities in Underserved Areas 

The second, and related, principle guiding our CRA refresh is that the regulations should 

encourage banks to seek out opportunities in underserved areas.  As I noted earlier, the CRA 

recognizes that banks make a unique contribution.  Banks are able to make targeted and valuable 

investments because of their stake in the local community and their knowledge of it.  As a long-

term stakeholder in a community, a bank’s efforts to finance housing, small businesses, and 

community services are not just good business short-term, but also good investments long-term 

as residents improve their economic standing and use more banking services.  Streamlining the 

CRA regulations and clarifying the performance measures could create stronger incentives for 


-8- 
 


banks to pursue the less obvious, but potentially more impactful, projects that low- and 

moderate-income neighborhoods need the most to become areas of opportunity.  

We will want to update the CRA in ways that reduce the distortions that lead to some 

areas becoming credit “hot spots” and others credit deserts.  Where there is a high density of 

banks relative to investment opportunities, the result of too many banks competing for too few 

CRA-qualified investments can be declining returns.  Meanwhile, other areas have a difficult 

time attracting capital not because the social return on investment is low, but rather because they 

are not in a bank’s major market, if they are served by a bank at all.  However we define a bank’s 

assessment areas in the future, the regulations need to be designed and implemented in a way 

that encourages banks to direct their community investment activities productively.   

Tailoring 

The third guiding principle is that the CRA regulations should be tailored to banks of 

different sizes and business models.  We should set standards that are flexible enough to evaluate 

the CRA performance of a $100 million bank no less effectively than a $2 trillion bank.  Banks 

seek clearer, simpler rules that result in more CRA activity with less burden.  We believe this can 

be done while retaining the flexibility to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance in light of its size, 

business model, capacity, and constraints as well as its community’s demographics, economic 

conditions, and credit needs and opportunities.  Regulatory revisions that do not contemplate 

evaluating CRA performance in context could arguably undermine the CRA’s greatest attribute--

its recognition that banks are uniquely situated to be responsive to the most important 

community and economic development needs in their communities.    

The typical small community bank focuses on serving its community through deposit and 

credit products and may not have the capacity to finance a major community development 


-9- 
 


initiative.  But as banks grow in size or specialize in different types of lending, they may have 

greater capacity to invest through additional channels.  We should be sensitive to the ways in 

which a bank’s business model, in addition to its size, influences the types of activities it 

undertakes to meet its CRA obligations.  We will want to maintain the flexibility to ensure that, 

no matter the business line, a bank can meet its CRA obligation by doing what it has the 

expertise to do well.  And as we look to improve our CRA evaluations, the agencies will need to 

determine what kind of data will be necessary to evaluate a bank’s CRA performance based on 

the activities it chooses and which banks should collect and report that data based on their scale 

and business model. 

Consistency and Predictability   

The fourth principle is that the revised regulations should promote greater consistency 

and predictability in evaluations and ratings, both within and across the agencies.  The members 

of our Federal Advisory Council have recommended that the regulations “need to be consistent 

across the [a]gencies and provide for all regulated financial institutions to be subject to the same 

CRA ‘crediting’, examination, and remedial standards.” 14  Banks have expressed understandable 

concern regarding the variation they see in evaluations.  Banks seek greater clarity in advance 

about what activities will qualify for CRA consideration.  They want to understand how the 

qualitative criteria--those measuring the impact and responsiveness of loans, investments, and 

services--will be factored into their ratings.   

This concern is not limited to banks.  The community organizations and local 

governments that are trying to attract bank financing to their projects need this clarity, too.  

Regulatory streamlining can help to promote consistency, as would regular examiner training.

Fair Credit Access 

The fifth and final principle for CRA modernization is to ensure that revised CRA 

regulations support its position as one of several mutually reinforcing laws designed to promote 

an inclusive financial services industry.  The central thrust of the CRA is to encourage banks to 

ensure that all creditworthy borrowers have fair access to credit.  For banks to be successful in 

meeting the credit needs of their entire community, it follows that they must guard against 

discriminatory or unfair and deceptive lending practices.  Ensuring fair access to credit is 

difficult and requires ongoing vigilance.15  For this reason, taking a holistic view of closely 

related issues is likely to be the best way to fulfill the purpose of the CRA, as one of several 

important laws intended to promote fair financial access.     

Affordable Housing and the CRA 

I want to briefly connect the dots between the high priority we put on strengthening the 

CRA and the pressing challenge of affordable housing that is a key focus of the work that you all 

do.  Access to affordable housing connects families concretely to place and can be a source of 

strength or fragility.  Pew just released a study showing that 38 percent of renter households in 

America are spending more than 30 percent of their pretax income on rent, representing a 19 

percent increase from 2001.16  The percent of renter households that are spending half or more of 

their pretax income on housing increased by 42 percent during the same period.   

Households that spend a high fraction of their income on rent often may find themselves 

unable to pursue proven strategies to achieve financial security and invest in their family’s

York: W.W. Norton & Company, 2017).

burden.

future.  They may need to turn to costly short-term sources of credit to cover emergency 

expenses.  Some may experience eviction if there is an unexpected expense or loss of income.   

To manage the high cost of housing, workers may be compelled to live far from where 

they work, rent substandard units, or resort to overcrowding.  Research shows that households 

that live far from work often pay a large share of their budget in commuting costs.17 As a society, 

we need to do better in ensuring that affordable housing is available where it is needed.     

The supply of affordable housing is a good example of a problem of national scope 

whose solution must be tailored to local needs and economic conditions.  This audience knows 

better than most about the complex dynamics that affect housing at the local level.  Local 

decisions on land use, zoning, taxes, and leveraging of federal funding, and whether community 

needs are prioritized, are at the heart of whether neighborhoods thrive.  

I’m not going to suggest that there are any easy answers to housing affordability.  Still, 

the CRA is one of the important policy levers that can make a difference by encouraging 

solutions that are tailored to local needs and circumstances.  It does this by encouraging banks to 

provide affordable and sustainable mortgage products to qualified low- and moderate-income 

families. This helps those families have a chance to purchase homes sustainably and build equity.  

In addition, by encouraging banks to work with the community to identify tailored rental and 

homeownership investment opportunities, the CRA helps encourage the construction of 

affordable housing where it is needed most.

The Path Forward 

In our effort to refresh the CRA regulations, we will continue to honor the purpose of the 

CRA by encouraging banks to engage in local community and economic development initiatives.   

I am confident that there are ways to update the areas where we evaluate a bank’s CRA 

performance without losing the core focus on place.  We should do more to encourage banks to 

offer deposit and credit products designed to help rent-burdened customers save for 

homeownership and build strong credit scores that will enable them to succeed in obtaining 

mortgage credit on favorable terms. We should do more to encourage banks to lend to the 

underserved entrepreneurs and small businesses that hold the promise of providing jobs and 

growing local economies.  Even as the economy looks strong overall, significant challenges 

remain for low- and moderate-income areas, making the CRA and its focus on local credit needs 

more important than ever.  I look forward to hearing from you over the next several months to 

help inform our interagency effort to refresh the CRA regulations.   

This conference is an opportunity for ANHD members to envision the future for New 

York’s neighborhoods and discuss critical actions to achieve that vision.  I know you have a full 

agenda today, replete with pressing conversations on the compelling challenges that face your 

neighborhoods.  I want to applaud your work to ensure that all of New York’s neighborhoods are 

communities of opportunity.  Thank you.
