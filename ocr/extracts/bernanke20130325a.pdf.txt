I’m very pleased to participate in this conference honoring my good friend 

Mervyn King.  As Mervyn noted in a recent speech in New York, we had adjoining 

offices at MIT as young academics and never imagined that 30 years later we still would 

be colleagues--as central bankers.1  Now, as then, I value his advice and insight. 

The topic of this session is lessons learned from the financial crisis.  For me, 

perhaps the central insight is that the recent crisis, despite its many exotic features, was in 

fact a classic financial panic--a systemwide run of “hot money” away from assets whose 

values suddenly became uncertain.  In that respect, the crisis was akin to many other 

financial crises faced by governments and central banks--including that most venerable of 

central banks, the Bank of England--over the centuries.  The response to the crisis 

likewise followed the classic prescriptions of liquidity provision, liability guarantees, 

asset evaluation and disposition, and recapitalization where necessary.  Although the 

crisis had classic features, to a significant extent it took place in a novel institutional 

context, making diagnosis and response more challenging:  For example, in the United 

States, collateralized wholesale funding rather than conventional bank deposits 

constituted the hot money, and run pressure was experienced not only by banks but by 

diverse other institutions, such as structured investment vehicles.  In addition, the scale 

and complexity of globalized financial institutions and markets made it difficult to predict 

how the crisis might spread or to coordinate the response.  One of the few positive 

aspects of this episode was the extraordinary degree of international cooperation achieved 

among policymakers, including the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve, in 

responding to the crisis.

Because I have developed these themes in some detail elsewhere, I thought today 

I would tackle a different and more recent issue that has arisen in the aftermath of the 

crisis--the issue of whether, in the widespread easing of monetary policies, we are seeing 

a competitive depreciation of exchange rates.2  Like other aspects of the crisis, the notion 

of competitive depreciation has strong classical antecedents, particularly in relation to the 

global Great Depression of the 1930s.  So let me start by briefly revisiting the older 

discussion and its evolution. 

As my audience knows, on the eve of the Great Depression the exchange rates of 

most industrial countries were determined by the rules of the international gold standard--

or, more technically, by the gold-exchange standard, as foreign exchange (primarily 

dollars and pounds sterling) was used along with gold as a form of international reserves.  

The gold standard, which had been suspended during World War I, was painstakingly 

rebuilt in the 1920s.  Unfortunately, the reconstructed gold standard had a number of 

serious problems.  For one, the exchange rates implied by the gold valuations that 

countries chose for their currencies following World War I were in some cases far from 

the levels consistent with balanced flows in trade and payments.  Notably, as John 

Maynard Keynes pointed out in his famous pamphlet, The Economic Consequences of 

Mr. Churchill, the British pound was overvalued under the new gold standard, which 

disadvantaged British exports and contributed to weak economic conditions in the United

Kingdom in the late 1920s.3  One of Mervyn King’s predecessors as governor of the 

Bank of England, Montagu Norman, who presided over both Britain’s return to the gold 

standard and its subsequent exit, said of the ill-fated choice of parity for the pound:  

“Only God could tell whether it [the value in gold chosen for the pound sterling] was or 

was not the correct figure”; another commentator added, “But of course the Deity may 

not be an Economist.”4  

Another problem, which became clear as the global economy weakened and 

financial conditions deteriorated, was that fixed exchange rates under the gold standard 

were vulnerable to speculative runs.  Although runs, or in some cases policy decisions, 

effectively took a number of countries off the gold standard in the early 1930s, the 

financial world was shaken to its foundation when the United Kingdom, the unofficial 

center of the global gold standard, was forced by a speculative attack to leave gold in 

September 1931.  Over the next five years, essentially all of the world’s industrial nations 

left the gold standard, either de facto or de jure.  Declines in the value of the departing 

nation’s currency, sometimes very sharp ones, typically followed. 

The uncoordinated abandonment of the gold standard in the early 1930s gave rise 

to the idea of “beggar-thy-neighbor” policies.  According to this analysis, as put forth by 

important contemporary economists like Joan Robinson, exchange rate depreciations 

helped the economy whose currency had weakened by making the country more 

competitive internationally.5  Indeed, the decline in the value of the pound after 1931 was

associated with a relatively early recovery from the Depression by the United Kingdom, 

in part because of some rebound in exports.  However, according to this view, the gains 

to the depreciating country were equaled or exceeded by the losses to its trading partners, 

which became less internationally competitive--hence, “beggar thy neighbor.”  Over 

time, so-called competitive depreciations became associated in the minds of historians 

with the tariff wars that followed the passage of the Smoot-Hawley tariff in the United 

States.  Both types of policies were decried--and in some textbooks, still are--as having 

prolonged the Depression by disrupting trade patterns while leading to an ultimately 

fruitless and destructive battle over shrinking international markets. 

Economists still agree that Smoot-Hawley and the ensuing tariff wars were highly 

counterproductive and contributed to the depth and length of the global Depression.  

However, modern research on the Depression, beginning with the seminal 1985 paper by 

Barry Eichengreen and Jeffrey Sachs, has changed our view of the effects of the 

abandonment of the gold standard.6  Although it is true that leaving the gold standard and 

the resulting currency depreciation conferred a temporary competitive advantage in some 

cases, modern research shows that the primary benefit of leaving gold was that it freed 

countries to use appropriately expansionary monetary policies.  By 1935 or 1936, when 

essentially all major countries had left the gold standard and exchange rates were market-

determined, the net trade effects of the changes in currency values were certainly small.  

Yet the global economy as a whole was much stronger than it had been in 1931.  The 

reason was that, in shedding the strait jacket of the gold standard, each country became 

free to use monetary policy in a way that was more commensurate with achieving full

employment at home.  Moreover, and critically, countries also benefited from stronger 

growth in trading partners that purchased their exports.  In sharp contrast to the tariff 

wars, monetary reflation in the 1930s was a positive-sum exercise, whose benefits came 

mainly from higher domestic demand in all countries, not from trade diversion arising 

from changes in exchange rates. 

The lessons for the present are clear.  Today most advanced industrial economies 

remain, to varying extents, in the grip of slow recoveries from the Great Recession.  With 

inflation generally contained, central banks in these countries are providing 

accommodative monetary policies to support growth.  Do these policies constitute 

competitive devaluations?  To the contrary, because monetary policy is accommodative 

in the great majority of advanced industrial economies, one would not expect large and 

persistent changes in the configuration of exchange rates among these countries.  The 

benefits of monetary accommodation in the advanced economies are not created in any 

significant way by changes in exchange rates; they come instead from the support for 

domestic aggregate demand in each country or region.  Moreover, because stronger 

growth in each economy confers beneficial spillovers to trading partners, these policies 

are not “beggar-thy-neighbor” but rather are positive-sum, “enrich-thy-neighbor” actions. 

Again, the distinction between monetary policies aimed at domestic objectives 

and trade-diverting exchange rate devaluations or other protectionist measures is critical.  

The former can be mutually beneficial, the latter are not.  Indeed, it was this view that 

prompted the Group of Seven central bankers and finance ministers to issue a statement 

in February agreeing to refrain from actions focused on achieving competitive advantage

by weakening their currencies and reaffirming that fiscal and monetary policies would 

remain oriented toward meeting domestic objectives using domestic instruments.7   

Among the advanced economies, the mutual benefits of monetary easing are 

clear.  The case of emerging market economies is more complicated.  To a first 

approximation, industrial countries are most concerned that domestic aggregate demand 

be set at the level that best fosters price stability and a return to full employment at home.  

In contrast, many emerging market economies may be concerned not only with the level 

of domestic demand (as needed to achieve objectives for employment and inflation) but 

with other considerations as well.  First, because in recent decades many of these 

countries have pursued an export-led strategy for industrialization, they may be leery of 

expansionary policies in the advanced economies that, all else being equal, tend to cause 

the currencies of emerging market economies to appreciate, restraining their exports.  

Second, because many emerging market economies have financial sectors that are small 

or less developed by global standards but open to foreign investors, they may perceive 

themselves to be vulnerable to asset bubbles and financial imbalances caused by heavy 

and volatile capital inflows, including those arising from low interest rates in the 

advanced economies. 

I agree these challenges are significant.  However, a few points should be made.  

Regarding the effects of monetary easing on exchange rates and exports, I would note 

that trade-weighted real exchange rates of emerging market economies, with some 

exceptions, have not changed much from their values shortly before the intensification of 

the financial crisis in late 2008.  Moreover, even if the expansionary policies of the

advanced economies were to lead to significant currency appreciation in emerging 

markets, the resulting drag on their competitiveness would have to be balanced against 

the positive effects of stronger advanced-economy demand.  Which of these two effects 

would be greater is an empirical matter.  Simulations of the Federal Reserve Board’s 

econometric models of the global economy suggest that the effects are roughly offsetting, 

so that accommodative monetary policies in the advanced economies do not appear, on 

net, to have adverse consequences for output and exports in the emerging market 

economies.8  A return to solid growth among the advanced economies is ultimately in the 

interest of advanced and emerging market economies alike. 

Regarding capital flows:  It is true that interest rate differentials associated with 

differences in national monetary policies can promote cross-border capital flows as 

investors seek higher returns.  But my reading of recent research makes me skeptical that 

these policy differences are the dominant force behind capital flows to emerging market 

economies; differences in growth prospects across countries and swings in investor risk 

sentiment seem to have played a larger role.9  Moreover, the fact that some emerging 

market economies have policies that depress the values of their currencies may create an 

expectation of future appreciation that in and of itself induces speculative inflows. 

                                                 
8 Other work also supports the finding of no adverse spillovers.  For example, one that finds strong positive 
spillovers is Bennett T. McCallum (2003), “Japanese Monetary Policy, 1991-2001,” Federal Reserve Bank 
of Richmond, Economic Quarterly, vol. 89 (Winter), pp. 1-31, 
www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_quarterly/2003/winter/pdf/mccallum.pdf.   
9 For example, Fratzscher, Lo Duca, and Straub find that factors other than U.S. monetary policy have been 
substantially more important as drivers of capital flows to emerging market economies; see Marcel 
Fratzscher, Marco Lo Duca, and Roland Straub (2012), “A Global Monetary Tsunami?  On the Spillovers 
of US Quantitative Easing,” Centre for Economic Policy and Research, Discussion Paper Number 9195

Of course, heavy capital inflows and their volatility pose challenges to emerging 

market policymakers, whatever their source.  Policymakers do have some tools to address 

these concerns.  In recent years, emerging market nations have implemented 

macroprudential measures aimed at strengthening their financial systems and reducing 

overheating in specific sectors, such as property markets.  Policymakers have also 

experimented with various forms of capital controls.  Such controls raise concerns about 

effectiveness, cost of implementation, and possible microeconomic distortions.  

Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund has suggested that, in carefully 

circumscribed circumstances, capital controls may be a useful tool.10 

In sum, the advanced industrial economies are currently pursuing appropriately 

expansionary policies to help support recovery and price stability in their own countries.  

As the modern literature on the Great Depression demonstrates, these policies confer net 

benefits on the world economy as a whole and should not be confused with zero- or 

negative-sum policies of trade diversion.  In fact, the simultaneous use by several 

countries of accommodative policy can be mutually reinforcing to the benefit of all.  

Let me end these remarks as I began, by paying tribute to Mervyn King.  He has 

been a leader in the central banking community during an extraordinarily difficult period.  

I wish him the very best in the next stage of his career. 

                                                 
10 Importantly, such circumstances exclude the use of capital controls to avoid other necessary 
macroeconomic policy adjustments, such as greater exchange rate flexibility.  See, for example, 
International Monetary Fund (2012), “The Liberalization and Management of Capital Flows: An 
Institutional View,” (Washington:  International Monetary Fund).
