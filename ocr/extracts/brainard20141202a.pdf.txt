 On behalf of the Federal Reserve System, I am pleased to be here at the first in a 

series of outreach meetings designed to hear your feedback and concerns about regulatory 

burden.  I want to thank you all for taking the time to participate in this important 

dialogue and also extend my thanks to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco for 

providing space for today’s meeting at the Los Angeles Branch.  

 The Federal Reserve takes its mandate under the Economic Growth and 

Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA) seriously.  The EGRPRA review 

provides an opportunity for the agencies to consider whether current regulations are well-

balanced and effective or whether any are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome.  

Public input is critical to this process and will help us identify potential solutions to 

alleviate undue burden. 

 Well-conceived regulations help to ensure the safety and soundness of our 

banking system, as well as the fair treatment of consumers.  But unnecessary regulations 

drain bank resources and reduce the important services that depository institutions 

provide to households and businesses.   

 Creating balanced regulations that are effective and thoughtfully calibrated to 

avoid undue burden requires input from stakeholders.  In-person meetings, like the one 

we are holding today, help us gather information that is critical to our understanding of 

how regulations affect not only the banking industry but also the consumers and 

communities they serve.  They also enable stakeholders to learn from one another and 

provide us with multiple perspectives on the complex issues that our regulations address.  

Outside of these meetings, we also look forward to receiving written comments in which

you can elaborate on how to improve our regulations in more detail than we can cover in 

the time we have today.    

 We recognize that depository institutions come in many sizes, have different 

business models, and manage different risks.  As a result, it is often necessary to tailor 

regulations to the institution.  Applying a one-size-fits-all approach to regulations may 

produce a small benefit at a disproportionately large compliance cost to smaller 

institutions.  

 Of particular concern in this regard is the need to ensure our regulations are 

appropriately calibrated for smaller institutions.  For example, because the largest banks 

present the greatest risk to the stability of our financial system, many of the regulations 

passed under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 

(Dodd-Frank Act) are specifically targeted at these firms.  It would be counterproductive 

to apply those same expectations to small banks.  Accordingly, we think it is important to 

tailor rules whenever possible to clearly differentiate expectations for different portfolios 

of banks and reduce undue burden on community banks. Tailoring regulations may be 

more challenging in some areas, such as rules that provide transparency and fairness in 

consumer transactions. Those are standards that apply throughout the financial system.   

 I should note that the Dodd-Frank Act transferred rule-writing authority for many 

of the consumer laws and regulations to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or 

CFPB.  The review of those regulations must be undertaken by the CFPB under 

procedures incorporated in the Dodd-Frank Act rather than EGRPRA.  However, the 

Federal Reserve Board, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal 

Deposit Insurance Corporation retained rule-writing authority for the Community

Reinvestment Act, and we are interested in your comments regarding ways we can 

improve the regulation.   

 In addition to changes in the regulatory and supervisory landscape, the banking 

industry itself has also undergone major changes.  Advances in technology and shifts in 

industry composition between depository institutions and nondepository companies have 

changed the types of financial services and products that are offered, as well as how those 

services and products are accessed.  We will be very interested in your feedback 

regarding how these types of industry changes have impacted the effectiveness of our 

regulations.  

 Let me conclude by saying that we will consider your comments carefully as the 

agencies coordinate to discuss and consider the appropriate action that is likely to best 

serve our financial system and the interests of institutions and consumers.  The result will 

be contained in the agencies’ report to the Congress summarizing the issues raised and 

the agencies’ conclusions about the need for regulatory or legislative changes.  

 Thank you for joining us today.
