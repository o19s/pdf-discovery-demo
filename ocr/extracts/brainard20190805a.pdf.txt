It is a pleasure to be here in Kansas City with Federal Reserve Bank President Esther 

George to talk about the future of America’s payment system.1    

Our payment system is a vital part of America’s infrastructure that touches everyone. The 

choices we make about our payment infrastructure today will affect all Americans many years 

into the future. Today I am excited to announce the Federal Reserve will invest in a new service 

to help ensure that real-time payments are available to everyone. The Federal Reserve will 

develop the FedNow ServiceSM, a real-time payment and settlement service for the future.2 

Everyone deserves the same ability to make and receive payments immediately and securely, and 

every bank deserves the same opportunity to offer that service to its community. FedNow will 

permit banks of every size in every community across the country to provide real-time payments 

to their customers.  

Today, whether you are relying on ACH, a debit card, or a check, it can take as much as a 

few days to get access to your funds. With a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment 

infrastructure, the funds would be available immediately—to pay utility bills or split the rent 

with roommates, or for small business owners to pay their suppliers. Immediate access to funds 

could be especially important for households on fixed incomes or living paycheck to paycheck, 

when waiting days for the funds to be available to pay a bill can mean overdraft fees or late fees 

that can compound. Similarly, getting immediate access to funds from a sale in order to pay for

supplies can be a game changer for small businesses, potentially avoiding the need for costly 

short-term financing.  

Last November, we asked the public about possible actions the Federal Reserve could 

take to support interbank settlement of faster payments.3 We received more than 350 comments 

on a Federal Reserve faster payment service, representing nearly 800 organizations. Fully 90 

percent of these comments called for the Federal Reserve to operate a real-time service for faster 

payments. Support came from a wide range of stakeholders, including individuals, merchants, 

fintech firms, and banks.4 Commenters noted that the Federal Reserve would ensure equitable 

access to banks of all sizes nationwide by operating a real-time service for faster payments 

alongside the private-sector system. Commenters highlighted the importance of safety in faster 

payments and noted the Federal Reserve’s record of resiliency, especially during periods of 

stress. Commenters observed that a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment service would 

increase competition, decrease market concentration, and provide a neutral platform for 

innovation.  

This broad support echoes and expands on the conclusions of the Faster Payments Task 

Force. Similarly, the U.S. Treasury Department recommended that “the Federal Reserve move 

quickly to facilitate a faster retail payment system, such as through the development of a real-

time settlement service that would also allow for more efficient and widespread access to 

innovative payment capabilities.”5

In determining the path forward, we are building on the Federal Reserve’s long history of 

operating payment systems as a core part of the nation’s payment infrastructure. Since they 

opened for business around the country in 1914, as directed by the Congress, the Federal Reserve 

Banks have provided payment and settlement services—in healthy competition with private-

sector providers—to achieve public benefits ranging from resiliency to innovation to equal 

access. When you look across the current payment infrastructure, whether in check processing, 

automated clearinghouse (ACH) services, or funds transfers, you will see a Federal Reserve 

service operating alongside private-sector providers. The General Accountability Office has 

concluded that the Federal Reserve’s provision of payment services has benefited the U.S. 

payment system and its users.6  

The Federal Reserve does not have regulatory authority over the pricing set by a private-

sector system or to require a private-sector system to extend the service to banks of all sizes, 

particularly the last mile. In some other countries, central banks have been assigned the 

responsibility for regulating payment systems. However, this is not the approach that Congress 

has taken. Instead, the Federal Reserve’s role as an operator has long been seen as an effective 

approach to promote accessible, safe, and efficient payments in the United States.  

Through the FedNow Service, we will provide a foundation for the future—a modern 

payment infrastructure that allows innovation and competition to flourish and delivers faster 

payments safely and securely for all. To ensure fast payments are available to everyone, FedNow 

will be accessible to all banks, no matter the size. Given our long-standing service connections

with more than 10,000 banks across the country, the Federal Reserve is uniquely placed to 

deliver this outcome.  

The bar is high when we assess whether the Federal Reserve should provide a new 

payment and settlement service, as it should be. We have carefully analyzed the criteria of the 

Monetary Control Act and long-standing Federal Reserve policies, considered the comments 

provided by a wide range of stakeholders, and studied the experiences of foreign central banks.7 

We are not making this decision lightly. On balance, after carefully weighing important 

considerations on both sides, we have concluded it is our responsibility to take action in support 

of a real-time payment infrastructure accessible to all. While we will work hard to stand up the 

FedNow Service in a timely manner, our most important goal is to achieve nationwide access for 

all, reflecting our public mission. 

Building a Modern Payment Infrastructure  

A key foundation of the payment infrastructure is interbank clearing and settlement—the 

movement of funds and the associated information between banks. Today, the U.S. retail 

payment infrastructure lags behind many other countries. Europe, Mexico, and Australia have 

already implemented real-time interbank clearing and settlement capabilities. In contrast, here in 

the United States, the gap between the transaction capabilities in the digital economy and the 

underlying payment and settlement capabilities continues to grow.8   

Early adopters of fast payment services rely on a legacy infrastructure that was not 

designed to support faster payments. For example, some services offer real-time funds 

availability to certain consumers, but they conduct interbank settlement on a deferred basis using

legacy systems. This type of settlement entails a buildup of obligations—like IOUs between 

banks—that could present real risks to the financial system in times of stress. These are not 

resilient long-term solutions for our dynamic economy and the banks that support it.  

We are seeing some companies looking to establish a payment system that bypasses our 

banks and our currency. Facebook’s Libra project raises numerous concerns that will take time to 

assess and address. But one thing is clear: consumers and businesses across the country want and 

expect real-time payments, and the banks they trust should be able to provide this service 

securely—whatever their size. To provide everyone with the ability to send and receive funds 

securely on a 24x7x365 basis, banks need to embrace and invest in real-time innovations, and the 

Federal Reserve needs to provide a safe and efficient real-time interbank clearing and settlement 

service accessible to all banks. 

We are proud of our strong record of cooperating with and supporting private-sector 

services, while fostering competition for public benefit. We have provided vital support to the 

sole private-sector provider of real-time settlement for faster payments, and we will continue to 

do so. The Federal Reserve provided a joint account to enable the private-sector operator to offer 

real-time payments. Moreover, today we are announcing our intent to explore the expansion of 

Fedwire Funds Service and National Settlement Service operating hours to support the efficiency 

of the joint account structure for the private-sector real-time gross settlement (RTGS) service and 

provide broader benefits. That said, the joint account structure, with its requirement of 

prefunding and settlement on a private ledger, is fundamentally different from the approach the 

Federal Reserve will use to settle transactions directly between banks.

Fostering a Dynamic and Resilient Payment Infrastructure That Serves Everyone  

The Federal Reserve is committed to fulfilling our public policy goals in a spirit of 

cooperation and competitive fairness. We are pleased that the private-sector faster payment 

service is in the market, and we see important benefits from the resilient and competitive market 

that would result from the FedNow Service providing an alternative consistent with the 

requirements of the Monetary Control Act. The requirement to consider the best way to make our 

payment and settlement services accessible to banks across the country, along with long-standing 

principles including cost recovery over the long run, guides our assessment of when the Federal 

Reserve should engage in the payment system.9  In setting fees, the Federal Reserve is required 

by statute to “give due regard to competitive factors and the provision of an adequate level of 

such services nationwide.”10 I want to share with you some of the analysis—viewed through the 

prism of our public policy goals of accessibility, safety, and efficiency—that we considered in 

making today’s decision.  

Accessibility means serving more than 10,000 banks of varying sizes and missions that 

are in communities all around the country. It turns out no single private-sector provider of any 

U.S. payment system has ever achieved nationwide reach on its own, whether it be checks, ACH, 

cards, or wire transfers. Acting alone, a single private-sector RTGS service will face significant 

challenges in establishing an accessible infrastructure for faster payments with nationwide reach. 

In contrast, because of our experience with providing other services, the Federal Reserve already

has invested in connections and customer service relationships with nearly every bank, small and 

large, across the country.  

Currently, we provide payment services to nearly all banks either directly or indirectly. 

With our 12 regional Reserve Banks, we have the capacity to meet the needs of banks serving 

different communities and with different needs and operating models. For that reason, 

commenters stated that the Federal Reserve is uniquely positioned to offer nationwide access to a 

new payment and settlement service for faster payments. FedNow will allow faster payments to 

reach banks of all sizes and their customers across the country, which is especially important for 

rural communities, who often struggle with access to financial services.  

Guided by our public mission, the Federal Reserve serves the needs of all banks, no 

matter how small or challenging to reach, and with competitive fairness. In response to our 

request for feedback last November, several commenters emphasized how much they value the 

Federal Reserve’s mission of providing nationwide access on fair, transparent terms and 

expressed concern that a sole private-sector RTGS service provider may be less likely to exhibit 

the same commitment over the long run.  

Safety is also vital. If the Federal Reserve does not establish the FedNow Service, there 

will be a single provider of real-time retail payment services. We are mindful of the serious 

safety issues associated with a single point of failure, a risk that will rise as faster payments 

grow. Stakeholders have noted the importance of having access to more than one real-time 

payment service for back-up purposes in order to provide resiliency through redundancy. In fact, 

many banks already take advantage of having connections to multiple operators today in check, 

ACH, and wire services. The Federal Reserve has always had a vital role in promoting the safety 

and stability of the U.S. payment system by providing liquidity and operational continuity

especially in times of stress. The FedNow Service would allow the Federal Reserve to extend 

this role into the real-time retail payment market.    

Finally, competition will promote efficiency and innovation. The U.S. real-time retail 

payment infrastructure stands to gain from competition, including through higher service quality 

and lower prices over the long run, which in turn should support wider adoption.  

The FedNow Service will provide a neutral foundation for innovation and competition in 

end-user faster payment services. In response to the request for feedback, merchants and fintech 

companies commented that a Federal Reserve real-time retail payment service could broaden the 

scope for innovation in faster payments. They noted that a single provider that is owned and 

operated by one segment of the payment industry may focus on a narrow set of use cases that do 

not reflect the full breadth of possible use cases for faster payments. Recognizing the vibrancy of 

our payment industry, the addition of the FedNow Service could provide a springboard for 

broader private-sector participation in the development of innovative end-user services. 

Looking Forward  

With the announcement of the Federal Reserve real-time payment service, we are 

embracing a path that will bring transformative, rather than incremental, change to the retail 

payment infrastructure in the United States. The FedNow Service will run continuously at all 

times of the day, every day of the week, consistent with the needs of faster payments and will be 

designed to process large volumes of payments rapidly.  

In the months ahead, we intend to explore a variety of approaches to achieving a real-

time retail payment infrastructure with nationwide reach. One such approach might be for 

different payment services to interoperate by exchanging payments among the services directly.  

Such interoperability is an important goal that we will pursue as standards, technology, and

industry practices change over time, although it is not yet clear whether it will be an initial 

feature.  

The Federal Reserve plans to devote the necessary resources to deliver the highest quality 

FedNow Service in a timely manner. We are working to streamline our internal processes to 

move quickly in the market. President George will play an integral role in this new process, and 

the Conference of Reserve Bank Presidents has pledged its support.  

It is important for the Federal Reserve, working with the payment industry, to act quickly 

in finalizing the initial business requirements of the FedNow Service. We will need to hear the 

views of payment system stakeholders on the features of the FedNow Service, as discussed in the 

Federal Register notice announced today. We will engage with the industry through groups and 

forums to finalize the design and features of the service. We hope that these conversations will 

provide an opportunity for stakeholders to work together to shape the evolution of the U.S. 

payment system.  

Earlier this month, I joined my Reserve Bank colleagues for a visit with bankers and 

community organizations in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to hear about the biggest challenges they 

are facing. The head of a bank that has been serving the Scranton area for more than a century 

told me that for his community bank to remain competitive in its payment offerings, it is vital to 

be able to rely on the Federal Reserve for real-time payments just as he does for check, ACH, 

and wire transfer. I appreciate the importance of community banks to the economic health of our 

communities, and I recognize the role of the Federal Reserve in enabling community banks to 

offer payment services on a competitive basis. I am confident that by working together with all 

payment system stakeholders, we can collectively achieve widespread, safe, and efficient faster 

payments that will benefit all.
