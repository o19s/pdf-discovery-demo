I greatly appreciate the invitation from the Institute of International Finance to 

participate in this session on Japan’s role in the global economy.  Today, I will offer 

some reflections on factors holding back the recovery in advanced economies, the 

contribution that emerging Asia can make in boosting global growth, and the challenges 

facing Japan.  

We have seen marked differences in the strength of countries’ recoveries from the 

global financial crisis.  Most advanced economies are growing very slowly and operating 

well short of potential.  By historical standards, their performance is even more anemic 

that we would have expected, given the nature of the previous recession.  This shortfall 

likely reflects the unusually limited scope for fiscal stimulus at present, which very 

accommodative monetary policies have not been able to fully offset.  The recovery from 

the global recession of emerging market economies, especially in Asia, has been more 

robust, but even these economies are slowing in the face of weak global demand, and 

they would benefit from further progress toward a more balanced model of growth led by 

domestic demand.  Finally, until its tragic earthquake and tsunami, Japan was also 

recovering more rapidly than the other advanced economies.  But it, too, faces issues with 

the longer-run sustainability of its debt as well as other structural challenges that need to 

be addressed.   

The Weakness of the Recovery in the Advanced Economies 

The global financial crisis resulted in the most severe worldwide recession since 

the Great Depression.  Historically, such crises tend to leave persistent scars on the real 

economy, and the current weak recovery in the advanced economies appears to be no 

exception.   Economists at the Federal Reserve Board have added to the growing body of

research analyzing recessions and their aftermath, focusing specifically on the factors that 

determine the pace of recovery once the economy has hit bottom.1  They find that 

recoveries tend to be faster following deeper recessions, but slower following long 

recessions.  Recoveries from recessions associated with housing busts also tend to be 

unusually weak. 

This research finds that for the advanced economies--especially Europe and the 

United States--the growth in output has been somewhat weaker than past history would 

have suggested, even accounting for the depth and duration of the last downturn.  

Although monetary policy has been highly accommodative, the pace of fiscal 

consolidation in Europe and the United States has been much greater during this recovery 

than is typical following severe recessions.  Additionally, in Europe, financial strains 

have been acute, helping to push the region back into recession.  In the United States, 

spillovers from Europe and a still-depressed housing market also help account for our 

tepid recovery and elevated unemployment.  As I will discuss a bit later, Japan has fared 

somewhat better, but faces significant challenges of its own.   

The Role of Emerging Asia  

 In contrast to the advanced economies, emerging market economies, particularly 

in Asia, recovered sharply from the global downturn, in part by using countercyclical 

fiscal and monetary policies to bolster domestic demand.  Based on the research I 

referred to earlier, the recovery in the Asian economies appears on pace with what we

might have expected, given the severity of the previous recession.  This swift recovery 

has not only benefited Asia, but the global economy as well.   

 Lately, however, the momentum in the emerging Asian economies has weakened, 

in part as their exports to Europe and the United States have slowed.  Exports to China 

from other countries in the region have also weakened, partly because of the unwinding 

of China’s earlier stimulus programs, but also because China’s exports to the advanced 

economies have slowed, thus lowering its demand for imported parts and components.  

For the moment, emerging Asia is offsetting weakness in external demand through 

accommodative monetary and fiscal policies.  But ultimately, it would be desirable, both 

for the region and for the global economy, if emerging Asia were able to rely less on 

temporary policy stimulus and more on a fundamental rebalancing of growth toward 

domestic demand.  To be sure, progress toward rebalancing has already occurred, as 

evidenced by the substantial reduction in current account surpluses in the region since the 

onset of the global crisis.  However, some of this adjustment likely reflects cyclical 

factors, and, moreover, the aggregate current account of emerging Asia remains 

substantially in surplus.   

Greater reliance on domestic demand would not only help shield Asia’s economic 

growth from the weakness in the advanced economies; it would also boost the well-being 

of its citizens by enabling them to consume a greater share of the output they produce.  

Moreover, transforming emerging Asia into an independent engine of global growth 

would put the global economy on a much surer footing, thus helping to achieve the Group 

of Twenty nations’ commitment to strong, sustainable, and balanced growth.

What about Japan?  

Finally, I would like to turn to Japan, whose experience combines elements of 

both its emerging Asian neighbors and of other advanced economies.  Like other Asian 

economies, Japan shares a history of current account surpluses and export-dependent 

growth.  Also like other Asian economies, the Japanese economy bounced back faster 

from the global financial crisis, at least prior to its tragic earthquake and tsunami, than 

most advanced economies, and more robustly than in any Japanese recovery since the 

mid-1970s.  Strong exports to the rest of Asia supported this rebound.  However, Japan 

has not been immune to the slowdown in trade affecting the region.  Japanese exports 

have flattened out since about the middle of 2010, contributing to a negative trade 

balance for the first time since 1980.  Like its neighbors, Japan will need to look for 

alternative engines of growth.   

Notwithstanding its similarities to emerging Asia, the Japanese economy faces 

fiscal and demographic challenges similar to those of other advanced economies in 

Europe and the United States.  Japanese government spending helped propel the 

economy’s bounceback from recession, but it has also added to public debt, which the 

International Monetary Fund now projects will rise to 237 percent of gross domestic 

product (GDP) this year, the largest among the major advanced economies.2  Along with 

this high debt, aging of the population and slow GDP growth pose important concerns for 

fiscal sustainability. 

To date, the savings of Japanese household and firms have been more than 

enough to finance the government deficit; indeed, interest rates on government debt have

fallen to near record lows.  Accordingly, Japan, like the United States, has the scope to 

carry out fiscal consolidation plans that address long-run sustainability issues without 

endangering near-term growth prospects.  Currently, policymakers in both Japan and the 

United States face the challenge of designing policies that provide a credible commitment 

to medium-term deficit reduction without disrupting the fragile recovery.  But once in 

place, such policies should help reduce uncertainty and boost household and business 

confidence.   

Japan would also benefit from measures to increase its potential growth, which is 

generally estimated to have fallen to less than 1 percent and could decline further as 

population aging progresses.  It is widely believed that easing regulations could promote 

faster productivity growth, particularly in the services sector.  Declines in the working-

age population also make it desirable to boost labor force participation.  Higher 

employment and faster productivity gains would help to boost economic activity, enhance 

fiscal sustainability, and restore Japan’s contributions to global economic growth.     

Conclusion 

Growth in the advanced economies is still hampered by critical challenges and 

full recovery is likely to take several years.  Emerging market economies, particularly in 

Asia, have performed better, but both they and the global economy more generally would 

benefit by further rebalancing of their growth toward domestic demand.  Japan initially 

bounced back more quickly than other advanced economies from the global financial 

crisis, but its growth has slowed recently, and it also faces serious fiscal and structural 

challenges.  By addressing these challenges, Japan can enhance its long-term prospects 

and continue to play a leading role in Asia and the global economy.
