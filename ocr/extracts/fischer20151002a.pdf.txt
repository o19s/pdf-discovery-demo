 It is a pleasure to speak at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston’s annual 

conference, and I am grateful to President Rosengren and the organizers for inviting me.  

This afternoon I would like to discuss the challenges to formulating macroprudential 

policy for the U.S. financial system.1   

The U.S. financial system is extremely complex.  We have one of the largest 

nonbank sectors as a percentage of the overall financial system among advanced market 

economies.  Since the crisis, changes in the regulation and supervision of the financial 

sector, most significantly those related to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) and the Basel III process, have 

addressed many of the weaknesses revealed by the crisis.  Nonetheless, challenges to our 

efforts to preserve financial stability remain.   

The Structure, Vulnerabilities, and Regulation of the U.S. Financial System 

To set the stage, it is useful to start with a brief overview of the structure of the 

U.S. financial system.  A diverse set of institutions provides credit to households and 

businesses, and others provide deposit-like services and facilitate transactions across the 

financial system.2  As can be seen from panel A of figure 1, banks currently supply about 

one-third of the credit in the U.S. system.  In addition to banks, institutions thought of as 

long-term investors, such as insurance companies, pension funds, and mutual funds, 

                                                   
 
1 The views expressed here are my own and not necessarily those of others at the Board, on the Federal 
Open Market Committee, or in the Federal Reserve System.  I am grateful to Sirio Aramonte, Rochelle 
Edge, Luca Guerrieri, Michael Kiley, Nellie Liang, and Stacey Tevlin for their help in preparing this 
speech. 
2 In my overview of the financial system, I am sizing the major players by their credit provision.  But 
clearly, this is not the only metric that could and should be applied.  If we consider net income, or other 
proxies for value-added by different subsegments of the financial system, we also capture the role of 
financial service companies and organized exchanges--companies with limited balance sheets, but which 
nonetheless play a vital role in the workings of our financial system.

provide another one-third of credit within the system, while the government-sponsored 

enterprises (GSEs), primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, supply 20 percent of credit.  

A final group, which I will refer to as other nonbanks and is often associated with 

substantial reliance on short-term wholesale funding, consists of broker-dealers, money 

market mutual funds (MMFs), finance companies, issuers of asset-backed securities, and 

mortgage real estate investment trusts, which together provide 14 percent of credit.3  

In the first quarter of this year, U.S. financial firms held credit market debt equal 

to $38 trillion, or 2.2 times the gross domestic product (GDP) of the United States.  As 

the figure shows, the size of the financial sector relative to GDP grew for nearly 50 years 

but declined after the financial crisis and has only started increasing again this year. 

From the perspective of financial stability, there are two important dimensions 

along which the categories of institutions in figure 1 differ.  First, banks, the GSEs, and 

most of what I have called other nonbanks tend to be more leveraged than other 

institutions.  Second, some institutions are more reliant on short-term funding and hence 

                                                   
 
3 Other nonbanks are often referred to as shadow banks because they engage in bank-like credit 
intermediation but are generally not subject to the same supervision and regulation as traditional banks and 
do not have direct access to deposit insurance.  I will continue to call them other nonbanks.   

There is no universally accepted definition of what constitutes shadow banking.  As noted in 
International Monetary Fund (2014), most definitions classify shadow banks by entity.  Accordingly, by 
referring to other nonbanks as shadow banks, I am following an entity-based definition.  Indeed, the 
definition that I am using is what the International Monetary Fund would call the Flow of Funds definition 
of shadow banks (see table 2.1, page 73).  The Financial Stability Board (2013) describes shadow banking 
as “credit intermediation involving entities and activities (fully or partially) outside the regular banking 
system” (p. ii) and, in its annual Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report (see Financial Stability Board, 
2014), focuses on a class of institutions called Other Financial Intermediaries, which includes all financial 
intermediaries that are not banks, insurance companies, pension funds, public financial institutions, or 
central banks (p. 8).  This definition is close to the one that I am using but includes mutual funds.  The 
definition used by Adrian and Shin (2010) is also close to the one that I am using but includes public 
financial institutions (specifically, GSEs and agency and GSE-backed mortgage pools).  As the 
International Monetary Fund (2014) notes, shadow banking can also be defined according to activities and, 
indeed, they propose a classification that defines shadow banking as encompassing those activities by 
banks and nonbanks financed by nontraditional (noncore) liabilities.

vulnerable to runs.  For example, MMFs were pressured during the recent crisis, as their 

deposit-like liabilities--held as assets by highly risk-averse investors and not backstopped 

by a deposit insurance system--led to a run dynamic after a large fund broke the buck.  In 

addition (as highlighted in table 1), nearly half of the liabilities of broker-dealers 

consists--and consisted then--of short-term wholesale funding, which proved to be 

unstable in the crisis.   

The pros and cons of a multifaceted financial system 

The significant role of nonbanks in the U.S. financial system and the associated 

complex web of interconnections bring both advantages and challenges relative to the 

more bank-dependent systems of other advanced economies.4  A potential advantage of 

lower bank dependence is the possibility that a contraction in credit supply from banks 

can be offset by credit supply from other institutions or capital markets, thereby acting as 

a spare tire for credit supply.  As shown in table 2, historical evidence suggests that the 

credit provided by what I termed long-term investors--that is, insurance companies, 

pension funds, and mutual funds--has tended to offset movements in bank credit relative 

to GDP, as indicated by the strong negative correlation of credit held by these institutions 

with bank credit during recessions.  In other words, these institutions have acted as a 

spare tire for the banking sector.5   

                                                   
 
4 See Financial Stability Board (2014) for comparisons of the size of the bank and nonbank sectors in other 
advanced economies. 
5 Recent research has examined the potential benefits and costs associated with the growth and complexity 
of the financial system, including Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012), Philippon and Reshef (2012), and 
Zingales (2015).

However, complexity also poses challenges.  While the financial crisis arguably 

started in the nonbank sector, it quickly spread to the banking sector because of 

interconnections that were hard for regulators to detect and greatly underappreciated by 

investors and risk managers in the private sector.6  For example, when banks provide 

loans directly to households and businesses, the chain of intermediation is short and 

simple; in the nonbank sector, intermediation chains are long and often involve a 

multitude of both banks and other nonbank financial institutions.7   

Regulatory, supervisory, and financial industry reforms since the crisis 

U.S. regulators have undertaken a number of reforms to address weaknesses 

revealed by the crisis.  The most significant set of reforms has focused on the banking 

sector and, in particular, on regulation and supervision of the largest, most interconnected 

firms.  Changes include significantly higher capital requirements, additional capital 

charges for global systemically important banks, macro-based stress testing, and 

requirements that improve the resilience of banks’ liquidity risk profile.   

Changes for the nonbank sector have been more limited, but steps have been 

taken, including the final rule on risk retention in securitization, issued jointly by the 

Federal Reserve and five other agencies in October of last year, and the new MMF rules 

issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in July of last year, following 

                                                   
 
6 See Fischer (2015a, 2015b) for more detailed narratives on developments in the nonbank sector at the 
start of the global financial crisis. 
7 For example, in the old days, a bank would originate a mortgage and hold it in its portfolio.  Today, a 
bank might originate the same mortgage, but, instead of holding that loan on its balance sheet, it could 
securitize it--in effect, sell it--and the resulting security might be purchased with the help of short-term 
funding provided by an MMF.  And the process might not end there:  Next, that mortgage-backed security 
might be sold and repackaged into several new securities, and so on.

a Section 120 recommendation by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).8  

More recently, the SEC has also proposed rules to modernize data reporting by 

investment companies and advisers, as well as to enhance liquidity risk management and 

disclosure by open-end mutual funds, including exchange-traded funds.9  Other 

provisions include the central clearing requirement for standardized over-the-counter 

derivatives and the designation by the FSOC of four nonbanks as systemically important 

financial institutions.10  The industry has also undertaken important changes to bolster the 

                                                   
 
8 The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation, the SEC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, and the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development approved final rules for risk retention, as required under the Dodd-Frank Act, in October 
2014 (Board of Governors and others, 2014).  Under the final rules, sponsors of almost all types of 
securities will have to hold a 5 percent stake in the securities, although securitizations that are collateralized 
by qualified residential mortgages (as defined by the agencies) are exempt from risk retention.  The intent 
of risk retention is to improve loan underwriting and securitization structuring by better aligning the 
interests of lenders, securitization sponsors, and investors.  The SEC adopted new MMF rules in July 2014 
(U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2014).  These rules include two key provisions:  a floating net 
asset value requirement for prime MMFs sold to institutional investors and a system of “standby” liquidity 
fees and temporary restrictions on redemptions, or “gates,” for all MMFs except government MMFs that 
can be imposed at the discretion of an MMF’s board when the fund’s liquidity is impaired.  These rules are 
intended to mitigate the vulnerability of MMFs to destabilizing runs.     
9 On May 20, 2015, the SEC proposed rules to enhance and modernize disclosure of portfolio information 
and risks by registered investment companies, including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) 
(U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2015a).  The proposals would require funds to disclose to the 
SEC and the public more information about their borrowing, usage, and terms of derivatives and repurchase 
agreements, securities lending activity, and sensitivity to interest rates.  In addition, the proposal would 
introduce structured reporting formats to facilitate analysis of the data by the SEC and the public.  Also on 
May 20, 2015, the SEC proposed rules to require investment advisers to report more information about the 
assets, borrowing, and derivatives exposures of the separately managed accounts that they manage (U.S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission, 2015a).  On September 22, 2015, the SEC proposed rules to enhance 
liquidity risk management by mutual funds and ETFs (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 
2015b).  The proposal would require each of these funds to adopt a liquidity risk-management program, 
categorize the liquidity of every portfolio asset, set its own minimum share of “three-day liquid assets,” and 
disclose information about portfolio liquidity and the use of lines of credit and inter-fund lending.  The 
proposal also would allow mutual funds to use “swing pricing,” a process of adjusting the net asset value of 
a fund’s shares to pass on to purchasing or redeeming investors more of the costs associated with their 
trading activity.  
10 The Dodd-Frank Act requires that standardized swaps that previously traded in over-the-counter (OTC) 
markets be cleared through central counterparties, and that large participants in standardized swap markets 
be subject to heightened regulation.  These requirements are meant to address the vulnerabilities in the 
OTC derivatives market that were highlighted by the 2008 financial crisis.  The Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission (CFTC) and the SEC are tasked with implementing the Dodd-Frank Act provisions

resilience of its practices, including notable improvements to internal risk-management 

processes.11   

Some challenges to macroprudential policy 

The steps taken since the crisis have almost certainly improved the resilience of 

the U.S. financial system, but I would like to highlight two significant challenges that 

remain.   

First, new regulations may lead to shifts in the institutional location of particular 

financial activities, which can potentially offset the expected effects of the regulatory 

reforms.  The most significant changes in regulation have focused on large banks.  This 

focus has been appropriate, as large banks are the most interconnected and complex 

institutions.  Nonetheless, potential shifts of activity away from more regulated to less 

regulated institutions could lead to new risks.   

It is still too early to gauge the degree to which such adaptations to regulatory 

changes may occur, although there are tentative signs.  For example, we have seen 

                                                   
 
by defining registration and business-conduct requirements that apply to the clearing organizations, to large 
participants in the swap market, and to data repositories.  The SEC and the CFTC have finalized or initiated 
the rulemaking process for many of these regulations.  For instance, the CFTC issued the final rule on the 
registration of swap dealers and major swap participants in January 2012 (Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, 2012), while the SEC issued the final rule on operational and risk-management requirements 
for clearing agencies in October 2012 (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2012).     
11 The list of reforms in this section of the speech is not comprehensive and omits important steps taken by 
the private sector.  For example, supervisory and industry efforts have reduced the amount of intraday 
credit provided by the two large clearing banks (JPMorgan Chase and Bank of New York Mellon), which 
should improve the resilience of the triparty repurchase agreement market.  The industry has also 
undertaken important changes to bolster the resilience of its practices.  For example, firms in many parts of 
the financial system have initiated notable improvements to their internal risk-management processes.  See 
Joint Forum (2015) for examples of enhancements to credit risk practices that have been made by firms 
since the crisis.  These enhancements include increased focus on stress tests, enhanced reporting of 
exposures to counterparties and to industries, and improved systems to enable more detailed and more 
timely reporting.

notable growth in mortgage originations at independent mortgage companies as reflected 

in the striking increase in the share of home-purchase originations by independent 

mortgage companies from 35 percent in 2010 to 47 percent in 2014.  This growth 

coincides with the timing of Basel III, stress testing, and banks’ renewed appreciation of 

the legal risks in mortgage originations.12  As another example, there have also been 

many reports of diminished liquidity in fixed-income markets.  Some observers have 

linked this shift to new regulations that have raised the costs of market making, although 

the evidence for changes in market liquidity is far from conclusive and a range of factors 

related to market structure may have contributed to the reporting of such shifts.13 

Despite limited evidence to date, the possibility of activity relocating in response 

to regulation is a potential impediment to the effectiveness of macroprudential policy.  

This is clearly the case when activity moves from a regulated to an unregulated 

institution.  But it may also be relevant even when activity moves from one regulated 

institution to an institution regulated by a different authority.  This scenario can occur in 

the United States because different regulators are responsible for different institutions, 

and financial stability traditionally has not been, and in a number of cases is still not, a 

central component of these regulators’ mandates.  To be sure, the situation has improved 

since the crisis, as the FSOC facilitates interagency dialogue and has a shared 

responsibility for identifying risks and reporting on these findings and actions taken in its 

                                                   
 
12 For further description of recent dynamics in the mortgage market, see Bhutta, Popper, and Ringo 
(forthcoming). 
13 As highlighted in detail in the report about events in U.S. Treasury markets on October 15, 2014, the 
move toward increasingly electronic, algorithmic, and high-speed trading in the foreign exchange, equity, 
and Treasury securities markets is almost certainly changing some aspects of liquidity.  See U.S. Treasury 
and others (2015), which includes the findings of staff from the Department of the Treasury, the Board of 
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the SEC, and the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  See also Dudley (2015).

annual report submitted to the Congress.  In addition, FSOC members jointly identify 

systemically important nonbank financial institutions.  Despite these improvements, it 

remains possible that the FSOC members’ different mandates, some of which do not 

include macroprudential regulation, may hinder coordination.  By contrast, in the United 

Kingdom, fewer member agencies are represented on the Financial Policy Committee at 

the Bank of England, and each agency has an explicit macroprudential mandate.  The 

committee has a number of tools to carry out this mandate, which currently are sectoral 

capital requirements, the countercyclical capital buffer, and limits on loan-to-value and 

debt-to-income ratios for mortgage lending. 

A second significant challenge to macroprudential policy remains the relative lack 

of measures in the U.S. macroeconomic toolkit to address a cyclical buildup of financial 

stability risks.  Since the crisis, frameworks have been or are currently being developed to 

deploy some countercyclical tools during periods when risks escalate, including the 

analysis of salient risks in annual stress tests for banks, the Basel III countercyclical 

capital buffer, and the Financial Stability Board (FSB) proposal for minimum margins on 

securities financing transactions.  But the FSB proposal is far from being implemented, 

and a number of tools used in other countries are either not available to U.S. regulators or 

very far from being implemented.  For example, several other countries have used tools 

such as time-varying risk weights and time-varying loan-to-value and debt-to-income 

caps on mortgages.  Indeed, international experience points to the usefulness of these 


- 9 - 
 

tools, whereas the efficacy of new tools in the United States, such as the countercyclical 

capital buffer, remains untested.14 

In considering the difficulties caused by the relative unavailability of 

macroprudential tools in the United States, we need to recognize that there may well be 

an interaction between the extent to which the entire financial system can be strengthened 

and made more robust through structural measures--such as those imposed on the 

banking system since the Dodd-Frank Act--and the extent to which a country needs to 

rely more on macroprudential measures.15  Inter alia, this recognition could provide an ex 

post rationalization for the United States having imposed stronger capital and other 

charges than most foreign countries.   

Implications for monetary policy 

Though I remain concerned that the U.S. macroprudential toolkit is not large and 

not yet battle tested, that does not imply that I see acute risks to financial stability in the 

near term.  Indeed, banks are well capitalized and have sizable liquidity buffers, the 

housing market is not overheated, and borrowing by households and businesses has only 

begun to pick up after years of decline or very slow growth.  Further, I believe that the 

careful monitoring of the financial system now carried out by Fed staff members, 

particularly those in the Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research, and by the 

FSOC contributes to the stability of the U.S. financial system--though we have always to 

remind ourselves that, historically, not even the best intelligence services have succeeded 

                                                   
 
14 See Claessens (2014) for a comprehensive list of macroprudential tools and their uses across countries.  
See also Kuttner and Shim (2013), who find stronger effects of policies like loan-to-value and debt-to-
income ratio caps on housing credit relative to policies targeted at banks’ balance sheets and thereby loan 
supply.   
15 I am grateful to Michael Kiley of the Fed for this insight.

in identifying every significant potential threat accurately and in a timely manner.  This is 

another reminder of the importance of building resilience in the financial system. 

Nonetheless, the limited macroprudential toolkit in the United States leads me to 

conclude that there may be times when adjustments in monetary policy should be 

discussed as a means to curb risks to financial stability.  The deployment of monetary 

policy comes with significant costs.  A more restrictive monetary policy would, all else 

being equal, lead to deviations from price stability and full employment.  Moreover, 

financial stability considerations can sometimes point to the need for accommodative 

monetary policy.  For example, the accommodative U.S. monetary policy since 2008 has 

helped repair the balance sheets of households, nonfinancial firms, and the financial 

sector.   

Given these considerations, how should monetary policy be deployed to foster 

financial stability?  This topic is a matter for further research, some of which will look 

similar to the analysis in an earlier time of whether and how monetary policy should react 

to rapidly rising asset prices.  That discussion reached the conclusion that monetary 

policy should be deployed to deal with errant asset prices (assuming, of course, that they 

could be identified) only to the extent that not doing so would result in a worse outcome 

for current and future output and inflation.16   

There are some calculations--for example, by Lars Svensson--that suggest it 

would hardly ever make sense to deploy monetary policy to deal with potential financial 

instability.  The contention that macroprudential measures would be a better approach is 

persuasive, except when there are no relevant macroprudential measures available.  I 

                                                   
 
16 For more information on monetary policy and financial stability, see Svensson (2015).

believe we need more research into the question.  I also struggle in trying to find 

consistency between the certainty that many have that higher interest rates would have 

prevented the Global Financial Crisis and the view that the interest rate should not be 

used to deal with potential financial instabilities.  Perhaps that problem can be solved by 

seeking to distinguish between a situation in which the interest rate is not at its short-run 

natural rate and one in which asset-pricing problems are sector specific. 

Of course, we should not exaggerate.  It is one thing to say we have no 

macroprudential tools and another to say that having more macroprudential measures--

particularly in the area of housing finance--could provide major financial stability 

benefits.  It also seems likely that monetary policy should be used for macroprudential 

purposes with an eye to the tradeoffs between reduced financial imbalances, price 

stability, and maximum employment.  In this regard, a number of recent research papers 

have begun to frame the issue in terms of such tradeoffs, although this is a new area that 

deserves further research.17   

It may also be fruitful for researchers to continue investigating the deployment of 

new or little-used monetary policy tools.  For example, it is arguable that reserve 

requirements--a traditional monetary policy instrument--can be viewed as a 

macroprudential tool.  In addition, some research has begun to ask important questions 

about the size and structure of monetary authority liabilities in fostering financial 

stability.18 

                                                   
 
17 See Ajello and others (2015) and Svensson (2015) for examples of recent research in this area.   
18 See Kashyap and Stein (2012) and Frost and others (2015) for examples of research on these questions.   


- 12 - 
 

Conclusion 

To sum up:  The need for coordination across different regulators with distinct 

mandates creates challenges to the timely deployment of macroprudential measures in the 

United States.  Further, the toolkit to act countercyclically in the face of building 

financial stability risks is limited, requires more research on its efficacy, and may need to 

be enhanced.  Given these challenges, we need to consider the potential role of monetary 

policy in fostering financial stability while recognizing that there is more research to be 

done in clarifying the potential costs and benefits of doing so when conditions appear so 

to warrant. 

After all of the successful work that has been done to reform the financial system 

since the Global Financial Crisis, this summary may appear daunting and disappointing.  

But it is important to highlight these challenges now.  Currently, the U.S. financial 

system appears resilient, reflecting the impressive progress made since the crisis.  We 

need to address these questions now, before new risks emerge.
