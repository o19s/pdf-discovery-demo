Good morning.  I am pleased to address the Annual Conference of the Union of 

Arab Banks (UAB) as it celebrates 40 years of success representing the interests of the 

Arab banking and financial communities.   

The UAB may justifiably take great pride in its many accomplishments during the 

past four decades.  Among other achievements, the UAB has emerged as a key 

international and regional participant in developing policies that promote financial 

stability, economic integration, and sustainable development and prosperity.  The UAB 

has also been a champion of sharing best practices and training among regulators and 

bankers. 

The partnership that has developed between the Federal Reserve and the UAB 

may be counted among these successes.  Ten years ago, the Federal Reserve helped 

establish--with the support of many of the countries represented at this conference--the 

Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Financial Regulators’ Initiative.  Sarkis 

Yoghourtdjian of the Federal Reserve Board, who is attending with you today, was asked 

to lead this initiative, whose aim has been to provide technical assistance and bank 

supervision training to central banks and bank supervisory authorities.  Now in its 10th 

and final year, the Financial Regulators’ Initiative has sponsored more than 40 training 

programs and conferences throughout the MENA region, and it has provided many short-

term, on-the-job training opportunities for MENA regulators with U.S. banking agencies.  

We are grateful to the UAB for its many contributions to the success of this initiative. 

In addition to celebrating accomplishments, anniversaries also provide a time for 

reflection and self-assessment.  Governments, central bankers, financial regulators, and 

the banking industry still labor today in the long shadow cast by the global financial

crisis.  Against that backdrop, financial regulators around the world are engaged in a 

historic and sweeping renovation of the global financial structure.   

One of the most important goals is to ensure that banks hold more and higher-

quality capital, and have sufficient liquid assets on hand, to be able to survive a market 

shock or severe economic downturn.  In addition, we must push banking organizations of 

all sizes to ensure their compensation practices link pay to performance and do not 

encourage excessive risk-taking. 

Past and current crises underscore an additional lesson.  Then as now, 

international or regional financial crises require a coordinated response to safeguard the 

stability of the world’s financial system.  To that end, the UAB can play an important 

regional role by facilitating efforts to address potential cross-border issues, and by 

providing a local platform for strong cooperation between home and host supervisors 

during normal and crisis periods. 

At your conference this week, I anticipate you will discuss the opportunities and 

challenges that lay ahead for your members.  Among the topics, no doubt, will be the 

prospects for partnership between the public and private sectors, the importance of 

establishing institutions capable of managing crises, the effects of new regulatory and 

supervisory structures on the banking industry, and the role of the banking sector in 

promoting economic growth. 

We at the Federal Reserve face similar challenges and opportunities, and we look 

forward to working with you to find common approaches and solutions.  I wish you a 

successful and productive conference.  Warm congratulations on your 40th anniversary, 

and best wishes for another 40 years of success.
