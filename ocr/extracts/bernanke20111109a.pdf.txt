Welcoming Remarks by 
 

Ben S. Bernanke 
 

Chairman 
 

Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 
 

at the 
 

conference on 
 

Small Business and Entrepreneurship during an Economic Recovery 
 

Board of Governors 
 

Washington, D.C. 


November 9, 2011



Good morning. Welcome to the Federal Reserve Board and today’s conference, 

“Small Business and Entrepreneurship during an Economic Recovery.”  Let me begin by 

thanking the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the Ewing Marion Kauffman 

Foundation, both of which have cooperated closely with the Board of Governors in 

organizing this event.  This meeting is indeed an eclectic one, bringing together small 

business owners, lenders, technical assistance providers, government officials, and 

members of the academic community to explore the challenges faced by today’s 

entrepreneurs and to identify promising approaches to addressing their needs.  Events 

such as this one are particularly valuable because they allow us to draw on a broad range 

of experiences and evidence.  We are keenly interested in hearing your insights and look 

forward to sharing results from the Federal Reserve’s continued small business outreach 

and research efforts.    

Some of you may have attended a forum here last year that focused on credit 

access for small businesses.1  We hope to advance that discussion today by exploring not 

only the financing needs of creditworthy small businesses, but also the role these firms 

could play in creating jobs during these difficult economic times.  We will also discuss 

the unique challenges faced by women- and minority-owned firms.  We hope to be as 

concrete and practical as possible; for example, several conference papers assess the 

extent to which training, technical assistance, and other resources are available to support 

these and other small firms.  The ultimate goal of this meeting is to learn more about how 

best to support both small businesses and their communities--to understand what works 

and what doesn’t.   

                                                 
1 More information on “Addressing the Needs of Small Businesses,” held July 12, 2010, is available on the 
Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/conferences/asfbconf.htm.

Importance of Small Businesses to the Economy 

It’s no secret that the past few years have been very difficult for many small 

firms.  They have faced weak sales, diminished asset values, elevated uncertainty, and 

tight credit market conditions.  Many small business owners have had to lay off 

employees or defer hiring.  And many potential entrepreneurs with plans to start new 

businesses have put those plans on hold.   

The role of small businesses and entrepreneurship in job creation will be 

discussed in our first panel today.  As many of you are aware, small businesses have 

played an important role in fueling past economic recoveries.  We need to think carefully 

about how, in the current economic environment, our nation can best provide small 

businesses and entrepreneurs with the support they need to expand job opportunities.  

Small businesses also help our country compete globally; they often offer a level 

of agility in bringing innovative products to the global marketplace that larger firms 

cannot match.  At home, many entrepreneurs do more than provide important goods and 

services--they and their businesses help sustain the vitality of the neighborhoods in which 

they live and work.  Frequently, small business owners demonstrate their commitment to 

their communities by serving in leadership positions in local schools, volunteering for 

local nonprofit organizations, and engaging in civic affairs. 

For many people, starting a small business is an opportunity to follow one’s 

particular dream.  We should recognize that it can also be an important option for people 

confronting economic challenges in their lives, such as insufficient retirement savings.  A 

study conducted by the Kauffman Foundation suggests that both baby boomers and older

generations are increasingly turning to entrepreneurial activities.2  Tomorrow’s 

discussion will pay special attention to how these and other new entrepreneurs are 

adjusting to the changing landscape of financial services.   

Federal Reserve Efforts to Support Small Businesses 

The Federal Reserve System is committed to supporting small business and 

entrepreneurship.  We do that, for example, through research that adds to our stock of 

knowledge about the catalysts for and barriers to entrepreneurship, and through outreach 

programs to help small business owners and other community stakeholders gain access to 

a range of financing and technical assistance.   

For instance, in a recent forum sponsored by the Federal Reserve System and held 

in Jacksonville, Florida, both small business owners and their lenders stressed that it 

takes more than an enterprising spirit to succeed; entrepreneurs also must seek 

appropriate training and resources.  Forum participants emphasized the need to support 

organizations that offer valuable technical assistance and training programs, including 

state and regional economic development offices, small business development centers, 

community colleges, technical schools, and rural cooperative extension offices.  Similar 

forums in Chicago, Atlanta, and Denver--conducted by the Federal Reserve in 

cooperation with the Opportunity Finance Network, a national trade association for 

community development financial institutions (CDFIs)--highlighted examples of banks 

working closely with community development loan funds and other CDFIs to streamline 

client referral processes to match small businesses with appropriate lenders.  Our regional 

meetings also focused on providing capital and support services to minority-owned small

businesses. Through research and analytical efforts, we are working to deepen our 

understanding of credit market conditions facing small and new businesses, particularly 

the frictions that impede the flow of credit to creditworthy borrowers.  In addition, some 

of our community development offices conduct regional surveys to obtain a better 

understanding of the characteristics and financing needs of small business owners in their 

areas.  You will hear more about their findings during the second panel today. 

The Federal Reserve also continues to encourage bank examiners to adopt a 

balanced approach to reviewing banks’ lending to small businesses.  We hold training 

sessions for examiners and extend outreach to lenders to promote awareness about both 

the credit environment and available lending guidance and resources.  We would like to 

foster an environment in which lenders do all they can to meet the needs of creditworthy 

borrowers while maintaining appropriately prudent underwriting standards. 

Closing Observations 

The issues you will be discussing today and tomorrow are critical to everyone 

with an interest in the success of our nation’s small firms and entrepreneurs, and, by 

extension, of our economy as a whole.  Based on the wide variety of perspectives 

represented at today’s conference, I feel sure you won’t agree on the answers to all the 

many questions that will be raised.  But the dialogue itself is of great value.  We at the 

Federal Reserve have found that conferences such as this one help us to more effectively 

conduct our outreach and analytical work.  We hope that each of you will find this 

experience worthwhile as well.  Thank you in advance for sharing your insights about the 

challenges for small businesses, and I look forward to seeing the results of your work.
