Regulatory Reform”

Thank you for the opportunity to address the important topic of how the financial 

system and its regulation have evolved in response to the global financial crisis.  I will 

focus my remarks on the global initiative to expand central clearing of over-the-counter 

(OTC) derivatives.  While we have made significant progress in enlisting central clearing 

to reduce systemic risks, I will argue that there is a good deal more to do to ensure that 

the reforms achieve their potential and minimize the possibility of unintended and 

undesirable consequences.1 

Prior to the crisis, the then highly opaque market for OTC derivatives grew at an 

astonishing and unsustainable pace of nearly 25 percent per annum in a context of 

relatively light regulation and bilateral clearing.2  With the benefit of hindsight, we know 

that along with this torrid growth came an unmeasured and underappreciated buildup of 

risk.  The spectacular losses suffered by American International Group, Inc., or AIG, on 

its derivatives positions, and the resulting concerns about the potential effect of AIG’s 

failure on its major derivatives counterparties, serve as particularly apt reminders of the 

wider failures and weaknesses that were revealed by the crisis.   

The threats posed were global, and the response was global as well.  In September 

2009, the Group of Twenty (G-20) mandated that all sufficiently standardized derivatives 

should be centrally cleared--a sea change in the functioning and regulation of these 

markets.  And in the five intervening years, substantial progress has been made in the 

United States and abroad to implement this reform and begin to reduce systemic risk in 

                                                 
1 The views expressed here are my own and are not necessarily shared by other members of the Federal 

Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee. 
2 According to the Bank for International Settlements, the notional amount of OTC derivatives outstanding 

grew from $80.3 trillion in December 1998 to $598.1 trillion in December 2008, which corresponds to an 

annual growth rate of 22.2 percent per year.  For more information, see Bank for International Settlements,

these markets.  According to public data, roughly 20 percent of all credit derivatives and 

45 percent of all interest rate derivatives are now centrally cleared--amounts that have 

grown substantially since 2009, when central clearing of credit derivatives began and the 

amount of cleared interest rate derivatives was at roughly one-half of its current level.3  

These amounts should continue to grow over time as central clearing and, especially, 

client clearing requirements take effect in more jurisdictions. 

Given the global nature of derivatives markets, the success of the reform agenda 

depends critically on international coordination.  Thus, to support the move to central 

clearing and address other lessons from the financial crisis, regulators developed the new 

Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures (PFMIs) for the infrastructures that clear 

derivatives, securities, and payments.4  The PFMIs are comprehensive international 

standards for the governance, risk management, and operation of central counterparties 

(CCPs) and other financial market infrastructures.  Such standards are essential given 

that, in the interest of transparency and improved risk management, policymakers have 

encouraged the concentration of activities at these key nodes.  And it is particularly 

important that the standards be promulgated globally, given the potential for OTC 

derivatives to span multiple jurisdictions and to migrate to jurisdictions where standards 

and risk management are less robust.  Regulators are now engaged in the important work 

of translating these principles into national regulations.  Only when these strong

international standards have been implemented at CCPs around the world can the risk 

reduction promised by the global clearing mandate be fully realized. 

Further Challenges Facing Central Clearing  

The task is far from complete.  We must consider how central clearing and CCPs 

fit into the rest of the financial system.  From this systemwide perspective, central 

clearing raises a number of important issues that should be kept in mind as its use 

increases.  I will now consider several of those issues and associated challenges in some 

detail.   

A number of commentators have argued that the move to central clearing will 

further concentrate risk in the financial system.  There is some truth in that assertion.  

Moving a significant share of the $700 trillion OTC derivatives market to central clearing 

will concentrate risk at CCPs.  But the intent is not simply to concentrate risk, but also to 

reduce it--through netting of positions, greater transparency, better and more uniform 

risk-management practices, and more comprehensive regulation.  This strategy places a 

heavy burden on CCPs, market participants, and regulators alike to build a strong market 

and regulatory infrastructure and to get it right the first time.   

It has also been frequently observed that central clearing simplifies and makes the 

financial system more transparent.  That, too, has an element of truth to it, but let’s take a 

closer look.  Charts similar to the ones shown in figure 1 are frequently offered to 

illustrate the point that, as a CCP becomes a buyer to every seller and a seller to every 

buyer, it causes risks to be netted and simplifies the network of counterparties.  The 

dizzying and opaque constellation of exposures that exists in a purely bilateral market, 

illustrated in the chart on the left, is replaced by a neat hub-and-spoke network that is 


 - 4 - 

both known and more comprehensible, illustrated in the chart on the right.  The CCP and 

its regulators are then in a position to observe the CCP’s entire network, which can be 

important in the event that one or more clearing members become impaired.  CCPs may 

also be able to coordinate a response to problems in their markets in ways that individual 

clearing members would find very difficult.   

Figure 2 shows that, at the same time, in the real world CCPs bring with them 

their own complexities.  As the figure shows, we do not live in a simple world with only 

one CCP.  We do not even live in a world with one CCP per product class, since some 

products are cleared by multiple, large CCPs.5  Also, significant clearing members are 

often members of multiple CCPs in different jurisdictions.  The disruption of a single 

member can have far-reaching effects.  Accordingly, while CCPs simplify some aspects 

of the financial system, in reality, the overall system supporting the OTC derivatives 

markets remains quite complex. 

To carry out their critical functions, CCPs rely on a wide variety of financial 

services from other financial firms, such as custody, clearing, and settlement.  Many of 

these services are provided by the same global financial institutions that are also the 

largest clearing members of the CCPs.  The failure of a large clearing member that is also 

a key service provider could disrupt the smooth and efficient operation of one or multiple 

CCPs, and vice versa.  In the event of disorderly CCP failures, the netting benefits and 

other efficiencies that CCPs offer would be lost at a point when the financial system is 

already under significant stress.  Ultimately, the system as a whole is only as strong as its 

weakest link.         

                                                 
5 As an example, both the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Intercontinental Exchange clear credit 

default swaps. 


 - 5 - 

People often think of these relationships between CCPs and clearing members in 

terms of credit exposures, but there are also important interconnections in the need for 

and use of liquidity.  Historically, some CCPs viewed liquidity in terms of daily 

operational needs.  From a macroprudential perspective, this view of liquidity is far too 

narrow.  If a CCP is to act as a buffer against the transmission of liquidity shocks from a 

clearing member’s default, the CCP itself must have a buffer of liquidity it can draw on 

to make its payments on time even during periods of market stress.  The PFMIs 

introduced a new liquidity standard that requires CCPs to cover, at a minimum, the 

liquidity needs of the CCP on the failure of the single clearing member and its affiliates 

with the largest aggregate position, in extreme but plausible market conditions.  Liquidity 

needs are to be met with a predefined list of liquid resources, starting with cash.   

Moreover, the largest clearing members participate in many CCPs around the 

world.  Cash management at these clearing members, particularly intraday cash 

management, involves interconnected cash flows to and from a clearing member’s 

various CCPs, other market infrastructures, and other financial institutions.  If a clearing 

member were to default, cash flows and needed financial services could be disrupted 

simultaneously at several CCPs.  Failure of one or more CCPs to pay margin or settle 

obligations as promised could impair the ability of a clearing member to meet other 

obligations and transmit liquidity risk to others in the financial system.  Accordingly, 

CCPs require a liquidity profile that will allow them to absorb rather than amplify the 

liquidity shocks that are likely to materialize during a period of financial stress following 

a member’s default.  


 - 6 - 

Of course, clearinghouses have been around for quite some time and have 

generally stood up well even in severe crises.6  But let’s look a little deeper at the risks.  

During the global financial crisis, governments around the world took extraordinary 

actions to shore up many of the large financial institutions that are also large clearing 

members.  While it is not possible to say with confidence what would have happened if 

these measures had not been taken, it is surely the case that whatever pressures CCPs 

faced would have been many times greater, and the potential consequences much greater 

as well.  Moreover, as CCPs grow into their enhanced role in the financial system, they 

will represent an ever larger locus for systemic risk.  It is therefore important not to be 

lulled into a false sense of security that past performance is a guarantee of future CCP 

success.   

After the crisis, governments firmly resolved that even the largest financial 

institutions must be allowed to fail and be resolved without taxpayer support and without 

threatening the broader financial system or the economy.  CCPs therefore need to adapt 

to a world in which their largest clearing members will be allowed to fail and to be 

resolved without taxpayer support.  And, as I will discuss a little later, the same is true of 

CCPs--they, too, should have no expectation of taxpayer support if they fail.  To say it as 

plainly as possible, the purpose of all of this new infrastructure and regulation is not to 

facilitate the orderly bailout of a CCP in the next crisis.  Quite to the contrary, CCPs and

their members must plan to stand on their own and continue to provide critical services to 

the financial system, without support from the taxpayer.   

The Road Ahead:  Meeting the Challenges 

As you can see, central clearing represents the confluence of critical market 

infrastructure and systemic financial institutions.  As a result, the regulation and 

supervision of CCPs present particular challenges.  What matters most is the stability of 

the entire system, not that of one sector or another.  In the United States, CCPs are 

primarily regulated by either the Commodity Futures Trading Commission or the 

Securities and Exchange Commission.  Under authority provided by the Dodd-Frank 

Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Federal Reserve also plays 

a role in supervising and regulating systemically important CCPs and other financial 

market utilities.7  In addition, the Federal Reserve is the holding company supervisor of a 

number of the largest clearing members.  The challenge is to ensure that regulation and 

supervision take into account the broad implications of derivatives trading for CCPs, their 

members, and the broader financial system.  Close collaboration between regulators--both 

domestically and internationally--will be necessary to ensure that central clearing can 

promote the kind of financial system resiliency that will be required when another severe 

crisis threatens.   

While central clearing and CCPs do present a number of complex and unique 

challenges, these challenges are not insurmountable.  Several measures should be 

considered in the near term to further strengthen the market and regulatory infrastructure

of the Dodd-Frank Act.

relating to liquidity, transparency, stress testing, “skin in the game,” and recovery and 

resolution.     

Liquidity   

The adoption of the PFMIs around the world is driving improvements in CCP 

liquidity.8    Ultimately, CCPs and their supervisors will need to maintain vigilance to 

ensure that liquid resources are sufficient to withstand the kinds of liquidity shocks that 

would likely accompany a member’s default.  In addition, it is crucial that liquidity 

scenario analysis be a regular part of a CCP’s stress-testing program to help ensure that 

appropriate liquidity planning does not suffer from a lack of vision or imagination.      

Transparency   

Enhanced transparency is central to the reform agenda, and there has been some 

progress in this area.  But CCPs need to provide still greater transparency to their clearing 

members and to the public.  The G-20’s central clearing mandate shifted a significant 

amount of activity and control away from dealers to CCPs.  With this shift, CCPs took on 

the responsibility of managing risks in a way that is transparent to the clearing members 

who are subject to the decisions of the CCP.  Clearing members need a full and detailed 

understanding of their risk exposure to CCPs, which means that clearing members must 

have detailed and appropriate information on stress-test results, the specification and 

application of margin models, and the sizing of default funds to cover losses.  Without a 

clear picture of a CCP’s risk profile, clearing members cannot make informed decisions 

                                                 
8 In the United States, these standards were implemented by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 

for derivative-clearing organizations in November 2013 and by the Federal Reserve for certain financial 

market utilities that are designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council 

in October 2014.

about whether to clear with a particular CCP or how to judge their exposures to it.  All 

major stakeholders--clearing members, clients, regulators, and the broader market--

should be aware of the risks involved so that they can take appropriate steps to mitigate 

them. 

Stress testing   

The disclosure of CCP stress-test results to clearing members is important so that 

clearing members can have a full understanding of a CCP’s risk profile.  This disclosure, 

however, would be of little help if the stress tests themselves were insufficiently 

comprehensive and robust.  For example, consider a case in which a bank belongs to two 

CCPs that clear similar products but the disclosed stress tests for the CCPs are based on 

materially different scenarios.  This state of affairs could easily result in more confusion 

than clarity.   

It is time for domestic and international regulators to consider steps to strengthen 

credit and liquidity stress testing conducted by CCPs.  Currently, most major CCPs 

engage in some form of stress testing.  However, both clearing members and regulators 

need a more systematic view of what stress tests are performed, at what frequency, with 

what assumptions, and with what results.  Aside from these issues involving individual 

stress tests, there are also important questions about the comparability of stress scenarios, 

assumptions, and results across similar and different types of CCPs.  A related issue is 

whether regulators should consider some sort of standardized approach to supervisory 

stress testing.  Not all CCPs are alike.  But there may be approaches that could bring 

some of the benefits of standardization while allowing tailoring of some scenarios to the 

activities of particular CCPs or groups of CCPs.  Clearly, a greater degree of uniformity 


 - 10 - 

would be helpful to clearing members that are comparing test results across several CCPs 

and to regulators that are considering systemwide stability.  For example, there are likely 

some financial market stresses, such as rapid and significant increases in market 

volatility, that would be expected to have broad effects across financial markets and 

participants.  Coordinated stress tests could also help us better understand the 

macroprudential risks around liquidity that I discussed earlier.  Understanding the effect 

of such correlated stresses on a wide array of CCPs will be important for ensuring overall 

system resiliency.  Going forward, regulators will need to work collaboratively to ensure 

that stress tests are robust, informative, and appropriately comparable.       

Skin in the game   

A number of commentators have urged U.S. authorities to consider requiring 

CCPs to place significant amounts of their own loss-absorbing resources in front of the 

mutualized clearing fund or other financial resources provided by clearing members.  

These skin-in-the-game requirements are intended to create incentives for the owners of 

CCPs for careful consideration of new products for clearing, for conservative modeling 

of risks, and for robust default waterfalls and other resources to meet such risks as may 

materialize.9  The issue is a complex one, however, and a number of factors would need 

to be considered in formulating such a requirement.    

Recovery and resolution   

I have focused so far on what we can do to ensure that CCPs do not fail:  more 

transparency, enhanced stress testing, more robust capital and default waterfalls, stronger

liquidity, and increased incentives to appropriately manage risks.  I will conclude my 

remarks today by discussing what happens when all of these efforts encounter a severe 

stress event.  Try as we might to prevent the buildup of excessive risk, we need to be 

prepared for the possibility that a CCP may fail or approach failure in the future.  When 

and if such a crisis materializes, CCPs will be called on to stand on their own.  CCPs and 

regulators need to develop clear and detailed CCP recovery and resolution strategies that 

are well designed to minimize transmission of the CCP’s distress to its clearing members 

and beyond.   

Recovery and resolution planning is a matter of intense focus among regulators 

and industry participants.  Just last month, the Committee on Payments and Market 

Infrastructures and the Board of the International Organization of Securities 

Commissions released their final report on the recovery of financial market 

infrastructures.10  The report is part of an ongoing effort to provide guidance on 

implementing the PFMI requirements for recovery planning.  On the same day, the 

Financial Stability Board released a new report on the resolution of financial market 

infrastructures and their participants to supplement its earlier work on the report Key 

Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for Financial Institutions.11 

These reports stress that CCPs must adopt plans and tools that will help them 

recover from financial shocks and continue to provide their critical services without 

government assistance.  It has been a challenge for some market participants to confront

the fact that risks and losses, however well managed, do not simply disappear within a 

CCP but are ultimately allocated in some way to the various stakeholders in the 

organization--even if the risk of loss is quite remote.  This realization has generated a 

healthy debate among CCPs, members, and members’ clients and regulators that has 

provided fertile ground for new thinking about risk design, risk-management tools, and 

recovery planning.  To ensure that CCPs do not themselves become too-big-to-fail 

entities, we need transparent, actionable, and effective plans for dealing with financial 

shocks that do not leave either an explicit or implicit role for the government. 

Conclusion:  Realizing the Promise of Central Clearing  

A key question posed at this conference is whether the reforms instituted in 

response to the crisis have improved the strength and stability of the financial system.  In 

my view, the answer for OTC derivatives reform--and central clearing, in particular--is a 

positive one.  But final pronouncements are premature.  Post-crisis reforms and the rise of 

central clearing have started us down a path toward greater financial stability.  At the 

same time, central clearing brings with it a number of complexities that relate to the 

interaction between CCPs and the rest of the financial system, especially the global 

systemically important financial institutions that represent many of their largest clearing 

members.  Given the increasingly prominent role that central clearing will play in the 

financial system going forward, it is critical that we collectively get central clearing right.  

To do so, I have argued that it is imperative that we consider central clearing from a 

systemwide perspective, and that regulators will need to continue to work collaboratively 

with each other, both domestically and internationally.
