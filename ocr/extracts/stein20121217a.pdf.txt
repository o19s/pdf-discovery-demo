Thanks very much. It’s a pleasure to be part of this panel on the future of financial 

globalization.  I will focus my remarks on one important aspect of this issue--namely, the 

growing use of wholesale dollar funding by global financial institutions.  I’ll begin by 

briefly discussing research I’ve been doing, along with my coauthors Victoria Ivashina 

and David Scharfstein, which examines some of the consequences of this funding model 

during times of market stress.1  I’ll then touch on the policy implications of this and 

related work.  But first, the usual disclaimer:  The views that follow are my own and do 

not necessarily reflect the thinking of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market 

Committee. 

By way of background, the dollar liabilities of foreign banks have grown rapidly 

in the past two decades and now stand at about $8 trillion, roughly on par with those of 

U.S. banks.2  A significant proportion of foreign banks’ dollar liabilities are raised via 

U.S. branches, most of which are legally precluded from raising deposits insured by the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  The main source of funding for these branches, 

therefore, comes from uninsured wholesale claims such as large time deposits, making 

the cost and availability of such dollar funding highly sensitive to changing perceptions 

of these banks’ creditworthiness. 

In our work, we asked how shocks to the ability of foreign banks to raise dollar 

funding might lead to changes in their lending.  We began with a simple conceptual 

model:  Imagine a European bank that lends in euros to European firms and in dollars to

U.S. firms.  To finance its euro-denominated lending, it funds itself by issuing insured 

euro deposits to its local retail deposit base.  By contrast, to finance its dollar-

denominated lending, it raises funds in the wholesale dollar market.   

Because the bank’s dollar liabilities are uninsured, an adverse shock to the bank’s 

perceived creditworthiness will result in a spike in its dollar funding costs.  At the same 

time, the cost to the bank of funding in euros is unchanged to the extent that its euro 

deposits are insured.  So we might expect such a shock to induce the bank to shift its 

funding away from the U.S. wholesale market and toward the European deposit market.  

But what are the consequences of this adjustment, both for the geographic distribution of 

its lending and for the functioning of foreign exchange (FX) swap markets?3   

Note that if the bank wants to maintain the volume of its dollar-based lending, it 

will have to tap its insured deposit base to raise more euros and then swap these euros 

into dollars using the FX swap market.  However, if the induced funding realignment is 

big enough, and if arbitrageurs have limited capacity to take the other side of the trade, 

this large swap demand can cause a breakdown in the usual covered-interest-parity (CIP) 

relationship--a breakdown of the sort that we have seen during times of extreme market 

stress.  In this case, the direction of the deviation would be such that the cost of synthetic 

dollar borrowing--in other words, euro borrowing combined with an FX swap--would go 

up and would approach that of the now-elevated cost of funding directly in the wholesale 

dollar market.   

And given that any method of dollar funding--direct or synthetic--has become 

more expensive relative to euro funding, it then follows that an adverse shock to a global

bank’s perceived creditworthiness leads to a decline in its dollar-denominated lending 

relative to its euro-denominated lending.  So, two principal effects of the dollar funding 

shock are intimately connected:  a widening of the so-called CIP basis in the FX swap 

market, and a reduction in credit supply to firms that borrow in dollars.4 

To test the model’s implications, my coauthors and I focused on events in the 

second half of 2011, when the credit quality of a number of large euro-area banks became 

a concern and U.S. prime money market funds sharply reduced their lending to those 

banks.  In a span of four months, the exposure of money funds to euro-area banks fell by 

half, from about $400 billion in May to about $200 billion in September.5  Coincident 

with this contraction in dollar funding, the CIP basis widened in the direction predicted 

by our model, increasing the cost of obtaining synthetic dollars via the FX swap market.   

We used data from the international syndicated loan market to test the model’s 

predictions about the reaction of lending to this type of funding stress.  We found that 

dollar-denominated lending by euro-area banks fell relative to their euro-denominated 

lending, while this result did not hold for U.S. banks.  We also found that, even holding 

fixed the identity of the borrowing firm, a syndicate formed to make a dollar-

denominated loan during this period was less likely to include euro-area banks, while the 

same was not true of syndicates making euro-denominated loans.  Finally, euro-area 

banks that relied most on funding from U.S. money market funds also cut back most 

sharply on their dollar-denominated lending.6

FX swap prices and the differential implied by foreign- and domestic-currency Libor rates.

This last result is similar to one in recent work by my Fed colleagues Ricardo 

Correa, Horacio Sapriza, and Andrei Zlate.7  They documented that the U.S. branches of 

foreign banks that experienced the most shrinkage in their dollar-denominated large time 

deposits--funding that had been mostly provided by money market funds prior to mid-

2011--cut their U.S.-based commercial and industrial lending by more than banks that 

fared better on this score. 

Taken together, these findings have two types of policy implications:  one for 

central bank responses to dollar funding pressures and another for measures to regulate 

foreign banking firms that rely heavily on short-term wholesale funding. 

This analysis underscores that the Federal Reserve’s temporary dollar liquidity 

swap lines with the European Central Bank and other central banks are an effective 

response to stresses in dollar funding markets.  Last week, the FOMC approved the 

extension of these swap lines through February 1, 2014.  These lines have helped avert 

fire sales of dollar assets and maintain the flow of credit to U.S. households and firms.  

Although we documented cutbacks in dollar lending in the latter half of 2011 by foreign 

banks reliant on wholesale dollar funding, those cutbacks likely would have been more 

pronounced in the absence of the swap lines 

I will now turn to regulation.  It is useful to bear in mind that our current 

regulatory regime evolved during a period when the U.S. operations of foreign banks 

were largely net recipients of funding from their parents.  However, their reliance on less 

stable, short-term wholesale funding increased significantly in the decade leading up to

the financial crisis, when U.S. branches of foreign banks began borrowing large volumes 

of dollars to send to their foreign parents.  Such activity increases the vulnerabilities I 

described earlier.  And it may not only pose the risk of a cutback in lending, but could 

also threaten the safety and soundness of the foreign banks themselves--and of the U.S. 

entities exposed to those banks.  

The regulation of U.S. branches of foreign banks has changed little over the past 

decade, even in the face of these significant changes in the global banking landscape.  

However, last week, the Federal Reserve Board proposed new rules for foreign banking 

organizations that would address some of the concerns that I’ve discussed and thereby 

mitigate the attendant risks to U.S. financial stability.  These proposed rules apply 

enhanced prudential standards to foreign banking organizations and are designed to 

increase their resiliency.  Importantly, the rules will not disadvantage foreign banks 

relative to domestic U.S. banking firms, but rather the rules seek to maintain a level 

playing field.  To avoid or mitigate potential disruptions in wholesale dollar funding 

markets, the proposed rules require foreign banking organizations to hold sufficient high-

quality liquid assets to meet expected near-term net outflows in a stress scenario.  These 

rules should reduce the pressure on foreign banks that rely heavily on short-term dollar 

funding to either sell illiquid dollar assets or cut back on dollar lending in times of 

financial stress.  By helping to alleviate disruptions in dollar funding markets the rules 

should also reduce the reliance on swap lines in a future stress episode. 

Finally, the central role played by money market funds in the 2011 episode is a 

reminder of the fragility of these funds themselves--and of the risk created by their 

combination of risky asset holdings, stable-value demandable liabilities, and zero-capital

buffers.  The events following the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 provide even 

starker evidence of the risks that money market funds pose for the broader financial 

system.  In light of these vulnerabilities, I welcome the recent proposed recommendations 

by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for further money market fund reforms.8  

To conclude:  Financial globalization undoubtedly brings with it substantial 

benefits.  At the same time, it creates important challenges for financial stability and for 

the appropriate design of regulation.  The research discussed in conferences such as this 

one will help us better understand and respond to these challenges.  Thank you, and I 

look forward to your questions.
