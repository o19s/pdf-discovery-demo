Good morning.  It is a pleasure to be here today to talk about the Federal 

Reserve’s commitment to and oversight of community banking.  I appreciate the 

invitation to attend the American Bankers Association’s Conference for Community 

Bankers, as community banking has been a focus of my career and plays a vital role in 

supporting our economy. I believe it is particularly important to bring together 

community bankers at conferences like this to discuss issues impacting your banks and 

the communities that you serve. 

As many of you know, before joining the Federal Reserve, I was a community 

banker and more recently had the privilege to serve as the Kansas State Bank 

Commissioner.  While I’m not the first community banker to serve on the Board, I now 

have the honor of being the first governor to fill the role designated for someone with 

community banking experience on the Federal Reserve Board, a position that was created 

by statute in 2015.1  I plan to fulfill this unique responsibility by traveling widely and 

listening closely to community bankers, consumers, small business owners, community 

leaders--all of the stakeholders with an interest in this area.  I will take back the 

knowledge I gain from these discussions and use it to improve our work.  And in the 

process, I hope to help you better understand what the Federal Reserve is doing and what 

we are trying to accomplish.  In doing so, I am confident our work will be more effective 

and efficient.     

As you all know well, community banks are a critical engine of the economy, and 

they play a key role in providing access to credit in communities of all sizes--big, small, 

rural, and every size in between.  Community bankers not only assist in making people’s

dreams come true--whether the dream is starting a small business, buying a home or 

farm, or financing a car.  They also provide critical leadership in their communities in 

many ways--including serving on local boards of schools and hospitals, donating to 

nonprofits, and volunteering in the community.  For all of these reasons, and more, I 

firmly believe a thriving community banking sector is important to the health of the 

economy.  

Like many of you, I witnessed firsthand how community banks were significantly 

affected by the Global Financial Crisis, a crisis they did not cause.  In my work as state 

bank commissioner, I learned how bank failures affected cities and towns across the 

country, and in my home state of Kansas I saw the profound effects a single failure can 

have on a community. To ensure that community banks can continue to meet the credit 

needs of their communities, the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies strive to 

achieve a fair balance between safety and soundness and reducing unnecessary regulatory 

burden.  Given the straightforward nature of community banking, regulators have an 

obligation to develop and refine approaches to supervision that fit the smaller size and 

less-complex risk profiles of these banks.   If we keep our focus on appropriately tailoring 

regulatory requirements for community banks so they may continue to prudently thrive, 

then community bankers should be able to devote more resources and time to serving 

their customers and communities.  

Ultimately, when access to credit is limited, communities suffer and so does the 

larger economy.  In view of these goals and contributions, and an understanding that 

systemic risk is not likely to be posed by any single community bank, the Federal 

Reserve continues to tailor supervision and refine our approach to risk-focused

examinations of community banks.  We are also charged with supervising financial 

institutions to make sure they comply with applicable federal consumer protection laws 

and regulations.  Here too, we apply a risk-focused approach to consumer compliance 

supervision, focusing most intensely on those areas involving the greatest compliance 

risk.  Similarly, we want to ensure that rules that address the risks posed by the business 

models of the largest banks do not unintentionally create barriers to entry or unnecessary 

burden for community banks.  

During the remaining time with you today, I will touch on the condition of 

community banks, and supervision and regulation of community banks.  I am also 

interested in hearing your perspective on the challenges and opportunities in the current 

community bank landscape.   

Condition of Community Banks 

When I analyze how community banks are faring, I always keep in mind that the 

range of institutions we call community banks is remarkably diverse.  As Kansas State 

Bank Commissioner, I oversaw banks that had four employees and less than $20 million 

in assets up to institutions with more than 100 employees and more than $1 billion in 

assets.  It’s the same picture nationwide.  Though if we look more closely, we can see 

that three out of four community banks hold assets of less than $500 million.  As a 

regulator, I am particularly interested in how our work affects institutions of this size.    

One good reason for this interest is the distinct contribution community banks 

make to economic activity.  For example, while community banks account for just 17 

percent of financial industry assets, they are responsible for some 53 percent of bank 

lending to small businesses.

Further, the health of the community banking sector has improved significantly 

since the financial crisis.  Over the past decade, the majority of community banks have 

maintained high common equity tier 1 capital levels--consistent with the “well-

capitalized” designation under regulatory capital standards.  Though there are 

considerable challenges to the community bank model, these banks continue to post 

strong earnings, which, in turn, contribute to healthy capital accounts.     

In fact, given the sound condition of the banking industry, there were no 

community bank failures in 2018.  Our job now is to ensure that community banks 

continue to remain strong.  That requires bankers and supervisors alike to stay vigilant in 

the management and supervision of risks facing these institutions and the community 

bank model.  

While banks are performing well and loan portfolios are growing, we want to 

ensure that loans are underwritten prudently.  We also want bankers to actively manage 

concentrations of credit risk, and be mindful that strong lending activity can strain 

liquidity.  For example, concentrations of commercial real estate are rising, and are quite 

high at some banks, prompting us to remind bankers of the difficulties that such 

concentrations presented in the past.   

We also continue to focus on concentrations of agricultural credit.  In an ongoing 

effort to understand the emerging risks related to agricultural lending, the Federal 

Reserve Bank of Kansas City facilitates a National Agricultural Credit meeting 

semiannually.  In late March of this year, the Federal Reserve will be hosting this 

meeting in Washington, D.C.  In April, the Board will meet with the Community 

Depository Institution Advisory Council.  I view meetings like these as important

learning opportunities where I can hear directly from leaders in the field about the 

challenges and opportunities in community banking. 

These meetings and direct lines of communication with community bankers help 

to inform one of the Board’s primary goals of ensuring that both supervisory programs 

and regulations are appropriately tailored to the size, complexity, and risk of a financial 

institution. 

Supervision and Regulation of Community Banks 

The Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies have demonstrated a 

commitment to reducing regulatory burden, especially on community banks, while 

maintaining safety and soundness. In particular, the Federal Reserve has acted to 

implement provisions of S. 2155 that provide relief to community banks.   

Several proposals were issued at the end of last year, and I’d like to encourage 

this group to submit your views and comments on these proposals.  It is important for the 

Federal Reserve and other regulatory agencies to receive input directly from community 

bankers.  One of these important proposals is to implement the community bank leverage 

ratio.  While the community bank leverage ratio proposal would increase the minimum 

leverage ratio for banks that opt in to the new framework, the proposal would allow 

qualifying community banks to opt out of the more complicated  risk-based capital 

framework.  Other proposals include raising to $400,000 the threshold for determining 

when an appraisal is required for a residential real estate transaction, and excluding 

community banks from the Volcker rule.  

The Federal Reserve also acted to raise the asset threshold from $1 billion to $3 

billion of total consolidated assets for the Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and 


 - 6 - 

Loan Holding Company Policy Statement. This change allows more banking companies 

that have limited access to the capital markets to take advantage of using debt in bank 

acquisitions.  This helps foster local ownership of small banks.  The change also exempts 

eligible small holding companies from consolidated risk-based capital rules, a significant 

burden reduction. 

In December, the federal banking agencies issued a final rule allowing qualifying 

insured depository institutions with less than $3 billion in total assets to benefit from an 

extended 18-month on-site examination cycle.  This increases the former threshold of $1 

billion and provides examination burden relief to a substantial number of community 

banks with relatively simple risk profiles.  

With respect to supervision, the Federal Reserve continues to tailor and reduce 

burden by conducting portions of community bank examinations offsite.  However, we 

also understand the importance of face-to-face interaction and continue to be responsive 

to bankers’ requests for on-site examinations. 

The Federal Reserve has also implemented a risk-focused supervisory program--

the Bank Exams Tailored to Risk (BETR) program--which aims to identify low-risk 

activities within state member banks and apply appropriately streamlined examination 

work programs to these activities, and conversely, to identify high-risk activities within 

state member banks for prompt supervisory attention. 

This enhanced tailoring of supervision minimizes regulatory burden for the many 

community banks that are well managed, and directs supervisory resources to higher-risk 

activities where they are most needed to contain the risks that can result from aggressive

banking strategies.  Similarly, the Federal Reserve tailors its supervision of holding 

companies based on the size, complexity, and risk profile of each institution.  

Closing Remarks 

As I conclude, I would emphasize how crucial it is to balance effective regulation 

and supervision to ensure the safety and soundness of community banks while also 

ensuring that undue burden does not constrain the capacity of these institutions to support 

the communities they serve.  

As I previously noted, one of the most important aspects of my job, as I see it, is 

to have open lines of communication and feedback between regulators and community 

banks and bankers.  As a former community banker and state regulator, I understand how 

clear communication can help us all do our jobs better.  So, I encourage you--and 

everyone with a stake in this work--to share your thoughts on the impact of regulation on 

community banks and the communities they serve.  This dialogue is especially important 

as we continue to work to tailor our supervision and regulation to the size and risk profile 

of the institutions we oversee.  Although we have different responsibilities, I believe we 

can agree that we must keep our financial system strong, while maintaining the ability of 

community banks to fulfill their important role in our economy.
