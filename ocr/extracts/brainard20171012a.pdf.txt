I enjoyed Ben Bernanke’s paper titled “Monetary Policy in a New Era.” 1  He 

presents a compelling diagnosis of the issues facing policymakers and discusses a variety 

of policy options.  Bernanke proposes an approach to policy that is elegant and 

straightforward to communicate.  I will focus on those elements that I find particularly 

relevant for the challenges faced by policymakers and suggest some implications and 

complications.  My comments are not intended to address current policy.2 

The New Normal 

Policymakers in advanced economies are confronting a different constellation of 

challenges today than those that dominated the canon of U.S. monetary policymaking 

over the previous half-century, which I refer to as the “new normal.”3  A key feature of 

the new normal is that the neutral interest rate--the level of the federal funds rate that is 

consistent with the economy growing close to its potential rate, full employment, and 

stable inflation--appears to be much lower than it was in the decades prior to the crisis.  

In the Federal Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) most recent Summary of Economic 

Projections (SEP), the median FOMC participant expected a longer-run real federal funds 

rate, after subtracting inflation, of 3/4 percent, down sharply from the value the first time 

the policy projection was published in the January 2012 SEP of 2-1/4 percent--and the 

average value in the decades prior to the financial crisis of 2-1/2 percent.4

Committee.

4 The well-known Laubach-Williams model currently suggests an estimate of the longer-run neutral federal 
funds rate that is close to zero.  The latest estimates are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San 
Francisco’s website at http://www.frbsf.org/economic-
research/files/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.  Over the 1960-2007 period, the real federal 
funds rate--measured as the nominal federal funds rate less trailing four-quarter core PCE (personal 
consumption expenditures) inflation--averaged 2-1/2 percent.

The low level of the neutral rate limits the amount of space available for cutting 

the federal funds rate to offset adverse developments and thereby can be expected to 

increase the frequency and duration of periods when the policy rate is constrained by the 

effective lower bound, unemployment is elevated, and inflation is below target.  In this 

environment, frequent or extended periods of low inflation run the risk of pulling down 

private-sector inflation expectations, which could amplify the degree and persistence of 

shortfalls of inflation, thereby making future lower bound episodes even more 

challenging in terms of output and employment losses.  To the extent it is weighing on 

longer-run inflation expectations, the persistently low level of the neutral federal funds 

rate may be a factor contributing to the persistent shortfall of U.S. inflation from the 

FOMC’s target.5  

Further complicating the ability of central banks to achieve their inflation 

objectives in today’s new normal is the very flat Phillips curve observed in the United 

States and many other advanced economies, which makes the relationship between labor 

market conditions and price inflation more tenuous.  For instance, inflation has remained 

stubbornly below the FOMC’s 2 percent target for the past five years even as 

unemployment has fallen from 8.2 percent to 4.2 percent, a level that most experts 

believe is in the vicinity of full employment.6 

Bernanke’s paper provides an excellent review of the Federal Reserve’s efforts to 

operate in this new environment and makes some interesting new proposals.  Reflecting 

on the Fed’s available “policy toolbox,” Bernanke concludes that the available tools are 

                                                 
5 See, for example, Brainard (2017b), Kiley and Roberts (2017), and Nakata and Schmidt (2016).

not likely to be sufficient and proposes a framework that relies on forward guidance with 

commitment to help central banks achieve their inflation and employment objectives.  

The Makeup Principle  

The academic literature on monetary policy suggests a variety of prescriptions for 

preventing a lower neutral rate of interest from eroding longer-run inflation expectations.  

The paper argues convincingly that many of these proposals present practical difficulties 

that would create a very high bar for their adoption.  For instance, raising the inflation 

target sufficiently to provide meaningfully greater policy space could engender public 

discomfort or, at the other extreme, risk unmooring inflation expectations.  The transition 

to a notably higher target is likely to be challenging and could heighten uncertainty.    

As I have noted previously, the persistence of the shortfall in inflation from our 

objective is an important consideration for monetary policy.7  The makeup principle, in 

which policy would make up for past misses of the inflation target, is not reflected in 

most standard monetary policy frameworks, although it is an important precept in 

theory.8  Some of the proposals that have been advanced to implement this principle 

present some difficulties.  For example, while price-level targeting would be helpful in 

the aftermath of a recession that puts the economy at the effective lower bound, it could 

require tightening into a negative supply shock, which is a very unattractive feature, as 

Bernanke points out.9 

                                                 
7 See Brainard (2017b). 
8 See, for example, Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) or Reifschneider and Williams (2000). 
9 As Bernanke notes, one way to avoid this feature is to adopt “flexible price-level targeting,” in which 
policy takes into account resource utilization as well as the deviation of the price level from its target.  
Kiley and Roberts (2017) examine a form of flexible price-level targeting—which they refer to as a 
“shadow rate rule”—and find that it performs well. 


 - 4 - 

Bernanke proposes a framework that avoids this undesirable possibility by 

implementing a temporary price-level targeting framework only in periods where 

conventional policy is constrained by the lower bound.  Bernanke’s proposal thus has the 

advantage of maintaining standard practice in normal times while proposing a makeup 

policy in periods when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound and inflation is 

below target.   His proposed temporary price-level target would delay the liftoff of the 

policy rate from the lower bound until the average inflation over the entire lower bound 

episode has reached 2 percent and full employment is achieved.  This type of policy, 

which would result in temporary overshooting of the inflation target in order to make up 

for the previous period of undershooting, is designed to, in Bernanke’s words, “calibrate 

the vigor of the policy response . . . to the severity of the episode.”   

 The Normalization Bias 

The proposed temporary price-level targeting policy is designed to address what I 

see as one of the key challenges facing policymakers.  Following deep recessions of the 

type we experienced in 2008-09, there appears to be an important premium on 

“normalization.”  This was apparent in 2010, for instance, when there was substantial 

pressure among Group of Twenty officials to commit to timelines and targets for 

reducing fiscal support and to articulate exit principles for monetary policy.10  This 

inclination proved premature, as was evident from the subsequent intensification of the 

euro-area crisis.  

                                                 
10 The 2010 G-20 Toronto communiqué indicated that advanced economies “committed to fiscal plans that 
will at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016.”  The 
document is available on the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s website at 
https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/Documents/The%20G-
20%20Toronto%20Summit%20Declaration.pdf.  


 - 5 - 

Moreover, the benchmark for “normal” tends to be defined in terms of pre-crisis 

standards that involved policy settings well away from the lower bound, at least initially, 

because it may take some time to learn about important changes in underlying financial 

and economic relationships.  For example, the factors underlying what we now 

understand to be the new normal of persistently low interest rates were in many cases 

initially viewed as temporary headwinds.  In these circumstances, a standard policy 

framework calibrated around the pre-crisis or “old” normal may be biased to 

underachieving the inflation target in a low neutral rate environment.  The kind of policy 

framework that Bernanke proposes, which pre-commits to implementing the makeup 

principle based on the actual observed performance of inflation during a lower bound 

episode, could guard against premature liftoff and help prevent the erosion of longer-term 

inflation expectations. 

Monetary policymakers operate in an environment of considerable uncertainty 

and therefore have to weigh the risks of tightening too little or too late against those of 

tightening too much or too soon.  While past experience has conditioned U.S. 

policymakers to be highly attentive to the risks associated with a breakout of inflation to 

the upside, as in the 1970s, they balance these risks against those associated with 

undershooting the inflation target persistently, as in Japan in the late 1990s and the 2000s.   

In weighing these risks, the standard approach is typically designed to achieve 

“convergence from below,” in which inflation gradually rises to its target.  Given the lags 

in the effects of monetary policy, convergence from below would necessitate raising 

interest rates preemptively, well in advance of inflation reaching its target.  Moreover, 

particularly in the early stage of a recovery, this kind of preemptive approach tends of 


 - 6 - 

necessity to rely on economic relationships derived from pre-crisis observations, when 

policy rates were comfortably above the lower bound. 

During a period when the policy rate is limited by the lower bound, Bernanke’s 

proposal would represent a substantial departure from the standard approach.  While a 

standard policy framework would tend to prescribe that tightening should start 

preemptively, well before inflation reaches target, Bernanke’s temporary price-level 

target proposal would imply maintaining the policy rate at the lower bound well past the 

point at which inflation has risen above target.  In principle, policymakers would have to 

be willing to accept elevated rates of above-target inflation for a period following a 

lengthy period of undershooting. 

Just as policymakers could run a risk of low inflation becoming entrenched in the 

standard preemptive framework, so, too, there are risks in the temporary price-level target 

framework.  One risk is that the public, seeing elevated rates of inflation, may start to 

doubt that the central bank is still serious about its inflation target.  It is worth noting that 

the policy is motivated by the opposite concern--that convergence from below, following 

an extended lower bound episode, may lead to an unanchoring of inflation expectations to 

the downside.  Still, a conscious policy of overshooting may be difficult to calibrate, 

especially since the large confidence intervals around inflation forecasts suggest that the 

risks of an undesired overshooting are nontrivial.  A related risk is that the central bank 

would lose its nerve:  Maintaining the interest rate at zero in the face of a strong economy 

and inflation notably above its target would place a central bank in uncomfortable 

territory.   


 - 7 - 

One additional challenge of the proposed framework is specifying a path for the 

policy rate immediately following liftoff that smoothly and gradually eases inflation back 

down to target and facilitates a gradual adjustment of the labor market.  In the proposed 

framework, once the cumulative average rate of inflation during the lower-bound period 

has reached the target of 2 percent, policy would revert to a standard policy rule.11  This 

implies that a standard policy rule would kick in at a point when inflation is above target 

and the economy is at or beyond full employment.  Even with a smoothing (inertial) 

property, a standard policy rule could result in a relatively sharp path of tightening, and 

the anticipation of the steep post-liftoff rate path itself could undo some of the benefits 

associated with the framework.  Thus, there would likely need to be a transitional 

framework to guide policy initially post-liftoff that might make both communications and 

policy somewhat more complicated. 

Integrating the Policy Rate and the Balance Sheet 

The temporary price-level targeting framework proposed by Bernanke is 

appealing on a conceptual level because it proposes a simple and clear mechanism to help 

policymakers deal with the challenges posed by the lower bound on the policy rate in an 

environment of uncertainty.  The reality is more complicated, however, especially if, as 

the paper suggests, many central banks in advanced economies are likely to operate with 

an additional tool when the policy rate is constrained.  In the paper, Bernanke cites Chair 

Yellen’s 2016 Jackson Hole speech, which suggests that in a recession, the FOMC could 

be expected to turn to large-scale asset purchases as well as forward guidance after the 

federal funds rate is lowered to zero.12   

                                                 
11 In the paper, this rule is specified as an inertial Taylor rule. 
12 See Yellen (2016). 


 - 8 - 

Today, when many central banks in advanced economies are operating with two 

distinct tools, policymakers consider the effects of the balance sheet as well as the policy 

rate in their assessment of the extent of accommodation provided by monetary policy.  In 

the United States, from the time tapering was first discussed to the September 2017 

meeting, when the path for balance sheet runoff was adopted, FOMC minutes and 

statements suggest that participants considered the degree of accommodation provided by 

both policy tools in their discussions of the sequencing and timing of changes to policy 

settings.  Discussions about the sequencing of “normalization” and the delay of balance 

sheet runoff “until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way” 

effectively consider the extent to which maintaining the balance sheet may continue to 

provide makeup support for the economy while enabling the policy rate to escape the 

lower bound earlier than otherwise in a low neutral rate environment.   

As Bernanke acknowledges, now that many central banks have developed 

playbooks specifying the operational modalities associated with asset purchases, and 

there is some familiarity with their effects on asset prices and financial conditions, there 

is a greater likelihood that asset purchases would become a part of the policy reaction 

function, along with forward guidance, during lower-bound episodes.  Yet, as I have 

noted previously in the international context, asset purchases can complicate policy 

frameworks and communications, because their deployment and withdrawal has tended 

to be discontinuous and discrete and thus may be associated with greater uncertainty 

about the policy reaction function.13  It appears the public closely follows statements 

about both the policy rate and asset purchases to glean possible information about the 

                                                 
13 See Brainard (2015).

future overall stance of monetary policy.  This suggests there may be benefits in 

communications and predictability of a unified policy framework across the tools that is 

more predictable and continuous.  Relatedly, one helpful elaboration of the framework 

Bernanke proposes might be to incorporate a unified measure, or shadow rate, that would 

capture the degree of policy accommodation provided through the combined settings of 

both asset purchases and the policy rate.14  

Greater Cross-Border Spillovers 

Moving away from the policy proposal in the paper, there are two other aspects of 

a low neutral rate world that I want to touch on briefly:  cross-border spillovers and 

financial imbalances.  The new normal appears to be characterized by low neutral rates 

and a weak relationship between overall inflation and unemployment not only in the 

United States, but also in many other advanced economies with lower-bound episodes 

likely to be more prevalent.  The current environment appears also to evidence intensified 

cross-border feedback into financial conditions.15  In this kind of environment, it is 

conceivable the kind of committed forward guidance associated with the temporary price-

level targeting framework proposed by Bernanke, by helping rule out anticipation of a 

standard preemptive tightening, could help avoid unwarranted premature tightening 

through the exchange rate. 

 Given available data, it is difficult to disentangle whether the heightened cross-

border feedback effects are attributable to the low level of neutral rates, particular 

features of today’s lower-bound episodes, or the interaction of the policies adopted by 

many central banks.  In any case, recent Federal Reserve staff analysis suggests that 

                                                 
14 See, for instance, Krippner (2016) and Wu and Xia (2016). 
15 See Brainard (2016a, 2016b). 


 - 10 - 

cross-border spillovers have increased notably since the crisis and are quite large.  For 

instance, European Central Bank policy news that leads to a 10 basis point decrease in the 

German 10-year term premium is associated with a roughly 5 basis point decrease in the 

U.S. 10-year term premium; by contrast, these spillovers were smaller in the years 

leading up to the crisis.16 

Moreover, news about policy rates and term premiums appears to have quite 

different effects on exchange rates, such that the ordering of policy normalization can 

have important implications for exchange rates and associated financial conditions, as I 

discussed earlier this year.17  Recent staff estimates suggest that news about expected 

changes in the policy rate tends to have a large spillover through the exchange rate, 

whereas news about changes in term premiums tends to lead to corresponding cross-

border changes in term premiums, as discussed previously, with much smaller effects on 

the exchange rate.  Moreover, the exchange rate effect of changes in short-term rates is 

much greater than it was pre-crisis.  For instance, policy news that leads to a 25 basis 

point increase in the expected interest rate portion of the 10-year Treasury yield is 

associated with a roughly 3 percentage point appreciation in the dollar, which is three 

times greater than the response pre-crisis.  By contrast, policy news surrounding a change 

in U.S. term premiums has a muted effect on the exchange rate both now and pre-crisis. 

Financial Imbalances 

Finally, a low neutral rate environment may also be associated with a heightened 

risk of asset price bubbles, which could exacerbate the tradeoff for monetary policy 

between achieving the traditional dual-mandate goals and preventing the kinds of 

                                                 
16 See Kamin, Li, and Rodriguez (forthcoming).   
17 See Brainard (2017a).

imbalances that could contribute to financial instability.  Standard asset-valuation models 

suggest that a persistently low neutral rate, depending on the factors driving it, could lead 

to higher ratios of asset prices to underlying income flows--for example, higher ratios of 

prices to earnings for stocks or higher prices of buildings relative to rents.  If asset 

markets were highly efficient and participants had excellent foresight, this would not 

necessarily lead to imbalances.  However, to the extent that financial markets extrapolate 

price movements, markets may not transition smoothly to asset valuations that reflect 

underlying fundamentals but may instead evidence periods of overshooting.18  Such 

forces may have played a role in both the stock market boom that ended in the bust of 

2001 and the house price bubble that burst in 2007-09.   

The risks of such financial imbalances may be greater in the context of the kind of 

explicit inflation target overshooting policies proposed in the paper.  Again, if market 

participants were perfectly rational, overshooting policies would not likely pose financial 

stability risks.  But the combination of low interest rates and low unemployment that 

would prevail during the inflation overshooting period could well spark capital markets to 

overextend, leading to financial imbalances.  

Macroprudential tools are the preferred first line of defense to address such 

financial imbalances, which should in principle enable monetary policy to focus on price 

stability and macroeconomic stabilization.  But the development and deployment of 

macroprudential tools is still relatively untested in the U.S. context, and the toolkit is 

limited.  Although important research suggests that the situations under which monetary 

policy should take financial imbalances into account are likely to be very rare, some 

                                                 
18 See, for example, Case, Shiller, and Thompson (2012) and Greenwood and Schleifer (2014). 


 - 12 - 

recent research has pointed out that the case in favor of taking financial imbalances into 

account is strengthened when the consequences of financial crises are long lasting.19  In 

this case, another complication of a persistently low neutral rate may be a sharper 

tradeoff between achieving the traditional dual-mandate objectives and avoiding financial 

stability risks, which may make it even more difficult to achieve our price-stability 

objective.
