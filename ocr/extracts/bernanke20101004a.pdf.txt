Annual Meeting of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council

The recent deep recession and the subsequent slow recovery have created severe 

budgetary pressures not only for many households and businesses, but for governments 

as well.  Indeed, in the United States, governments at all levels are grappling not only 

with the near-term effects of economic weakness, but also with the longer-run pressures 

that will be generated by the need to provide health care and retirement security to an 

aging population.  There is no way around it--meeting these challenges will require 

policymakers and the public to make some very difficult decisions and to accept some 

sacrifices.  But history makes clear that countries that continually spend beyond their 

means suffer slower growth in incomes and living standards and are prone to greater 

economic and financial instability.  Conversely, good fiscal management is a cornerstone 

of sustainable growth and prosperity. 

Although state and local governments face significant fiscal challenges, my 

primary focus today will be the federal budget situation and its economic implications.1

Fiscal Challenges 

  I 

will describe the factors underlying current and projected budget deficits and explain why 

it is crucially important that we put U.S. fiscal policy on a sustainable path.  I will also 

offer some thoughts on whether new fiscal rules or institutions might help promote a 

successful transition to fiscal sustainability in the United States.   

The budgetary position of the federal government has deteriorated substantially 

during the past two fiscal years, with the budget deficit averaging 9-1/2 percent of 

national income during that time.  For comparison, the deficit averaged 2 percent of

national income for the fiscal years 2005 to 2007, prior to the onset of the recession and 

financial crisis.  The recent deterioration was largely the result of a sharp decline in tax 

revenues brought about by the recession and the subsequent slow recovery, as well as by 

increases in federal spending needed to alleviate the recession and stabilize the financial 

system.  As a result of these deficits, the accumulated federal debt measured relative to 

national income has increased to a level not seen since the aftermath of World War II. 

For now, the budget deficit has stabilized and, so long as the economy and 

financial markets continue to recover, it should narrow relative to national income over 

the next few years.  Economic conditions provide little scope for reducing deficits 

significantly further over the next year or two; indeed, premature fiscal tightening could 

put the recovery at risk.  Over the medium- and long-term, however, the story is quite 

different.  If current policy settings are maintained, and under reasonable assumptions 

about economic growth, the federal budget will be on an unsustainable path in coming 

years, with the ratio of federal debt held by the public to national income rising at an 

increasing pace.2

                                                 
2 For example, see the alternative fiscal scenario in the Congressional Budget Office (2010), The Long-
Term Budget Outlook (Washington:  CBO, June (revised August)), available at 
www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=11579&zzz=40884.  Stabilizing the ratio of federal debt to national income 
requires that spending on everything other than interest payments on the debt be brought into rough 
alignment with tax revenues over time.  Equivalently, the so-called primary budget deficit (the budget 
deficit exclusive of interest payments) must be reduced to zero. 

  Moreover, as the national debt grows, so will the associated interest 

payments, which in turn will lead to further increases in projected deficits.  Expectations 

of large and increasing deficits in the future could inhibit current household and business 

spending--for example, by reducing confidence in the longer-term prospects for the 

economy or by increasing uncertainty about future tax burdens and government 

spending--and thus restrain the recovery.  Concerns about the government’s long-run 


 - 3 - 

fiscal position may also constrain the flexibility of fiscal policy to respond to current 

economic conditions.  Accordingly, steps taken today to improve the country’s longer-

term fiscal position would not only help secure longer-term economic and financial 

stability, they could also improve the near-term economic outlook.  

Our fiscal challenges are especially daunting because they are mostly the product 

of powerful underlying trends, not short-term or temporary factors.  Two of the most 

important driving forces are the aging of the U.S. population, the pace of which will 

intensify over the next couple of decades as the baby-boom generation retires, and rapidly 

rising health-care costs.  As the health-care needs of the aging population increase, 

federal health-care programs are on track to be by far the biggest single source of fiscal 

imbalances over the longer term.  Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) 

projects that the ratio of federal spending for health-care programs (principally Medicare 

and Medicaid) to national income will double over the next 25 years, and continue to rise 

significantly further after that.3

The aging of the U.S. population will also strain Social Security, as the number of 

workers paying taxes into the system rises more slowly than the number of people 

receiving benefits.  This year, there are about five individuals between the ages of 20 and 

64 for each person aged 65 and older.  By 2030, when most of the baby boomers will 

have retired, this ratio is projected to decline to around 3, and it may subsequently fall yet 

  The ability to control health-care costs as our population 

gets older, while still providing high-quality care to those who need it, will be critical not 

only for budgetary reasons but for maintaining the dynamism of the broader economy as 

well.

further as life expectancies continue to increase.  Overall, the projected fiscal pressures 

associated with Social Security are considerably smaller than the pressures associated 

with federal health programs, but they still present a significant challenge to 

policymakers.  

The same underlying trends affecting federal finances will also put substantial 

pressures on state and local budgets, as organizations like yours have helped to 

highlight.4  In Rhode Island, as in other states, the retirement of state employees, together 

with continuing increases in health-care costs, will cause public pension and retiree 

health-care obligations to become increasingly difficult to meet.  Estimates of unfunded 

pension liabilities for the states as whole span a wide range, but some researchers put the 

figure as high as $2 trillion at the end of 2009.5  Estimates of states’ liabilities for retiree 

health benefits are even more uncertain because of the difficulty of projecting medical 

costs decades into the future.  However, one recent estimate suggests that state 

governments have a collective liability of almost $600 billion for retiree health benefits.6

It may be scant comfort, but the United States is not alone in facing fiscal 

challenges.  The global recession has dealt a blow to the fiscal positions of most other 

advanced economies, and, as in the United States, their expenditures for public health 


These health benefits have usually been handled on a pay-as-you-go basis and therefore 

could impose a substantial fiscal burden in coming years as large numbers of state 

workers retire.

care and pensions are expected to rise substantially in the coming decades as their 

populations age.7  Indeed, the population of the United States overall is younger than 

those of a number of European countries as well as Japan.8

The Need for Fiscal Sustainability  


Let me return to the issue of longer-term fiscal sustainability.  As I have 

discussed, projections by the CBO and others show future budget deficits and debts rising 

indefinitely, and at increasing rates.  To be sure, projections are to some degree only 

hypothetical exercises.  Almost by definition, unsustainable trajectories of deficits and 

debts will never actually transpire, because creditors would never be willing to lend to a 

country in which the fiscal debt relative to the national income is rising without limit.  

Herbert Stein, a wise economist, once said, “If something cannot go on forever, it will 

stop.”9

                                                 
7 See International Monetary Fund (2010), Navigating the Fiscal Challenges Ahead, IMF Fiscal Monitor 
Series (Washington:  IMF, May), available at www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fm/2010/fm1001.pdf 

  One way or the other, fiscal adjustments sufficient to stabilize the federal budget 

will certainly occur at some point.  The only real question is whether these adjustments 

will take place through a careful and deliberative process that weighs priorities and gives 

people plenty of time to adjust to changes in government programs or tax policies, or 

whether the needed fiscal adjustments will be a rapid and painful response to a looming 

or actual fiscal crisis.  Although the choices and tradeoffs necessary to achieve fiscal 

sustainability are difficult indeed, surely it is better to make these choices deliberatively 

and thoughtfully.

(Washington:  Center for Strategic and International Studies and Watson Wyatt Worldwide, March), 
available at http://csis.org/publication/2003-aging-vulnerability-index.

Arguably, the imperative to achieve long-term fiscal sustainability is an 

opportunity as well as a challenge.  Opportunities for both taxing and spending reforms 

are ample.  For example, most people agree that the U.S. tax code is less efficient and 

less equitable than it might be; moreover, the code is excessively complex and imposes 

heavy administrative and compliance costs.  Collecting revenues through a more 

efficient, better-designed tax system could improve economic growth and make 

achieving sustainable fiscal policies at least somewhat easier.  Likewise, many federal 

spending programs doubtless could be reformed to achieve their stated objectives more 

effectively and at lower cost.  Certainly, continued efforts to reduce health-care costs and 

government health spending, while continuing to ensure appropriate care for those who 

need it, should be a top priority. 

Failing to address our unsustainable fiscal situation exposes our country to serious 

economic costs and risks.  In the short run, as I have noted, concerns and uncertainty 

about exploding future deficits could make households, businesses, and investors more 

cautious about spending, capital investment, and hiring.  In the longer term, a rising level 

of government debt relative to national income is likely to put upward pressure on 

interest rates and thus inhibit capital formation, productivity, and economic growth.  

Larger government deficits increase our reliance on foreign lenders, all else being equal, 

implying that the share of U.S. national income devoted to paying interest to foreign 

investors will increase over time.  Income paid to foreign investors is not available for 

domestic consumption or investment.  And an increasingly large cost of servicing a 

growing national debt means that the adjustments, when they come, could be sharp and 

disruptive.  For example, large tax increases that might be imposed to cover the rising 


 - 7 - 

interest on the debt would slow potential growth by reducing incentives to work, save, 

hire, and invest.  Finally, a large federal debt decreases the flexibility of policymakers to 

temporarily increase spending as needed to address future emergencies, such as 

recessions, wars, or natural disasters.  

It would be difficult to identify a specific threshold at which federal debt begins to 

pose more substantial costs and risks to the nation’s economy.  Perhaps no bright line 

exists; the costs and risks may grow more or less continuously as the federal debt rises.  

What we do know, however, is that the threat to our economy is real and growing, which 

should be sufficient reason for fiscal policymakers to put in place a credible plan for 

bringing deficits down to sustainable levels over the medium term.  The sooner a plan is 

established, the longer affected individuals will have to prepare for the necessary 

changes.  Indeed, in the past, long lead times have helped make necessary adjustments 

less painful and thus politically feasible.  For example, the gradual step-up in the full 

retirement age for Social Security was enacted in 1983, but it did not begin to take effect 

until 2003 and will not be completed until 2027, thus giving future retirees ample time to 

adjust their plans for work, saving, and retirement.  

Fiscal Rules 

 Amid all of the uncertainty surrounding the long-term economic and budgetary 

outlook, one certainty is that both current and future Congresses and Presidents will have 

to make some very tough decisions to put the budget back on a sustainable trajectory. 

 Can these tough decisions be made easier for our elected leaders?  At various 

times, some U.S. Congresses and foreign governments have adopted fiscal rules to help 

structure the budget process.  Fiscal rules are legislative agreements intended to promote 


 - 8 - 

fiscal responsibility by constraining decisions about spending and taxes.  For example, 

fiscal rules may impose constraints on key budget aggregates, such as total government 

expenditures, deficits, or debt.  In the remainder of my remarks I will discuss the use of 

fiscal rules to address longer-term budget problems, beginning with a review of the U.S. 

and foreign experience. 

The United States has seen several attempts to apply fiscal rules, with mixed 

results.  In 1985, the Congress enacted the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law which, among 

other things, specified a target path for the federal deficit, including the elimination of the 

deficit by 1991.  However, the target path proved to be unattainable, and eventually the 

entire structure was abandoned.  One problem with this approach was that its primary 

focus and measure of success was the current budget deficit.  Although the emphasis on 

the current deficit was understandable, the approach ran aground of the fact that the 

budget deficit is driven not only by the choices of the Congress, but also by the 

performance of the economy.  If the economy is strong, for example, the deficit is almost 

bound to improve, as tax revenues increase and spending on the social safety net 

decreases; conversely, if the economy weakens, the deficit is likely to rise, 

notwithstanding prior efforts by the Congress to better manage government spending and 

taxes.   

With fiscal concerns still prominent, in 1990 the Congress and the President 

adopted a new approach, with two key elements.  First, this alternative approach capped 

the level of discretionary federal spending--that is, the spending subject to annual 

appropriations, including defense and nondefense purchases of goods and services.  

Second, it imposed a pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rule on tax revenues and mandatory 


 - 9 - 

spending, which is spending that continues automatically without an annual 

reauthorization; entitlement spending such as Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security 

makes up most of this category.  The PAYGO rule required that any tax reduction or 

mandatory spending increase be “paid for” with offsetting tax hikes or spending cuts, so 

that projected deficits over the 5- and 10-year horizons would not be worsened.  

Supported importantly by the strong economic growth of the 1990s, these rules are seen 

by many observers as having helped put the deficit on a declining path; indeed, the 

federal government generated a few annual surpluses.  The discretionary spending caps 

and the PAYGO rule were allowed to expire after the 2001 fiscal year, in part because 

concerns about deficits were waning at the time. 

Currently, the Congress operates under more-limited PAYGO rules.  The rules 

require that offsets for spending increases or tax cuts must be found within a 10-year 

budget horizon, but they also exempt a number of significant tax and spending programs.  

Putting aside these details of implementation, given current budgetary challenges, the key 

question is whether the traditional PAYGO approach is sufficiently ambitious.  At its 

best, PAYGO prevents new tax cuts and mandatory spending increases from making 

projected budget deficits worse; by construction, PAYGO does not require the Congress 

to reduce the ever-increasing deficits that are already built into current law. 

 Many other countries have experience with fiscal rules.  The European Union, by 

treaty, established fiscal rules in the early 1990s, with the goal of ensuring that all 

members would maintain sustainable fiscal policies.  The rules specified that countries 

should keep their government deficits at or below 3 percent of their gross domestic 

products (GDP), and that government debt should not exceed 60 percent of GDP.  Even 


 - 10 - 

before the recent financial crisis and recession, however, the enforcement mechanisms 

for these rules did not prevent these targets from being breached, and fiscal problems in 

several euro-area countries have recently been a source of financial and economic stress.  

European leaders are working to strengthen their tools for enforcing fiscal discipline.   

 Although fiscal rules have not been panaceas in the United States or the euro area 

as a whole, a number of other economies, in Europe and elsewhere, seemed to have found 

fiscal rules to be helpful in achieving greater budget discipline.  For example, 

Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, and the Netherlands all realized improvements in their 

fiscal situations after adopting rules that limit spending.  Canada saw improvement in its 

deficit after it implemented spending  limits in the early 1990s, and its ratio of public debt 

to national income fell substantially after 1998 when it put in place a “balanced budget or 

better” rule.  A number of emerging market nations, such as Chile, have also applied 

fiscal rules with some success.  According to the International Monetary Fund, about 80 

countries currently are subject to national or supranational fiscal rules.10

Clearly, a fiscal rule does not guarantee improved budget outcomes; after all, any 

rule imposed by a legislature can be revoked or circumvented by the same legislature.  

However, although not all countries with fiscal rules have achieved lower deficits and 

debt, the weight of the evidence suggests that well-designed rules can help promote 

improved fiscal performance.

Public Finances (Washington:  IMF, December), available at 
www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2009/121609.pdf. 

  I will discuss four factors that seem likely to increase 

their effectiveness. 

11 See IMF, Fiscal Rules, in note 10. 


 - 11 - 

First, effective rules must be transparent.  By shining a light on the problem and 

the range of feasible solutions, transparent policy rules clarify the budget choices that 

must be made, help the public understand those choices, and encourage policymakers to 

recognize the broader fiscal consequences of their decisions on individual programs.  In 

particular, transparent fiscal rules may help solve what economists refer to as a collective 

action problem.  When faced with spending decisions, most elected representatives want 

to be seen as garnering the greatest possible benefit for their constituents.  But if a prior 

agreement limits the size of the available pie, it may be easier to negotiate outcomes in 

which everyone accepts a little bit less.  Of course, transparency is enhanced by good 

watchdogs.  In the United States, the nonpartisan CBO has ably served that role since 

1974.  Nongovernmental organizations that focus on budget issues, such as nonprofit 

think tanks, can also promote transparency. 

  Second, an effective rule must be sufficiently ambitious to address the underlying 

problem.  As I mentioned, PAYGO rules, even when effective, were designed only to 

avoid making the fiscal situation worse; they did not attack large and growing structural 

deficits.  In the current U.S. context, we should consider adopting a rule, or at least a 

clearly articulated plan, consistent with achieving long-term fiscal sustainability.  

Admittedly, an important difficulty with developing rules for long-term fiscal 

sustainability in the United States is that, given the importance of health-care spending in 

the federal budget, the CBO would need to forecast health-care costs and the potential 

effects of alternative policy measures on those costs well into the future.  Such 

forecasting is very difficult.  However, any plan to address long-term U.S. fiscal issues, 


 - 12 - 

whether or not in the context of a fiscal rule, would have to contend with forecast 

uncertainties. 

Third, rules seem to be more effective when they focus on variables that the 

legislature can control directly, as opposed to factors that are largely beyond its control.  

For example, as I noted, actual budget deficits depend on spending and taxation decisions 

but also on the state of the economy.  As a result, when a target for the deficit or the debt 

is missed, ascribing responsibility may be difficult.  Current congressional procedures 

generally require the CBO to “score” proposed spending and tax programs for their 

budget effects over a specified, longer-term horizon; this approach, although not without 

its problems, has the advantage of linking budget targets directly to legislative decisions. 

 Fourth, and perhaps most fundamentally, fiscal rules cannot substitute for political 

will, which means that public understanding of and support for the rules are critical.  For 

example, the fiscal rules that Switzerland adopted in 2001 had overwhelming popular 

support; the widespread support no doubt contributed to their success in helping to reduce 

that country’s ratio of public debt to national income.  Conversely, in the absence of 

public support and commitment from elected leaders, fiscal rules may ultimately have 

little effect on budget outcomes.  Educating the public about the consequences of 

unsustainable fiscal policies may be one way to help build that support. 

Conclusion 

Today I have highlighted our nation’s fiscal challenges.  In the past few years, the 

recession and the financial crisis, along with the policy actions taken to buffer their 

effects, have eroded our fiscal situation.  An improving economy should reduce near-term 

deficits, but our public finances are nevertheless on an unsustainable path in the longer 


 - 13 - 

term, reflecting in large part our aging population and the continual rise in health-care 

costs.  We should not underestimate these fiscal challenges; failing to respond to them 

would endanger our economic future. 

Well-designed fiscal rules cannot substitute for the political will to take difficult 

decisions, but U.S. and international experience suggests that they can be helpful to 

legislators in certain circumstances.  Indeed, installing a fiscal rule could provide an 

important signal to the public that the Congress is serious about achieving long-term 

fiscal sustainability, which itself would be good for confidence.  A fiscal rule could also 

focus and institutionalize political support for fiscal responsibility.  Given the importance 

of achieving long-term fiscal stability, further discussion of fiscal rules and frameworks 

seems well warranted.
