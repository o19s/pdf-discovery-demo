Thank you, President Schmoke, for this award and for the opportunity to be here 

today to offer my congratulations to the members of the Class of 2016.  I would also like 

to recognize the vital support students have received from family, friends, and others, 

many of whom are here to share this great occasion.   

In a moment, I will explain why I am particularly proud and honored to be 

speaking to the new graduates of this university, but first I’d like to address students on a 

topic that I expect is on the minds of many of you, which is the job market. 

The short version of what I have to say is that while I expect workers will 

continue to face some challenges in the coming years, I believe, for two reasons, that the 

job prospects and career opportunities for new graduates at this time are very good.  First, 

after years of a slow economic recovery, you are entering the strongest job market in 

nearly a decade.  The unemployment rate, at 4.6 percent, is near what it was before the 

recession.  This is a level that has been associated with good job opportunities.  Job 

creation is continuing at a steady pace; the layoff rate is low; and job openings are up 

over the past couple years, which is another sign of a healthy job market.  There are also 

indications that wage growth is picking up, and weekly earnings for younger workers 

have made strong gains over the past couple of years.  That is probably one reason why 

younger workers reported feeling significantly more optimistic about the job market 

compared with 2013, according to a survey published just today by the Federal Reserve.1 

Challenges do remain.  The economy is growing more slowly than in past 

recoveries, and productivity growth, which is a major influence on wages, has been 

disappointing.   

                                                 
1 See Board of Governors (2016).  In a survey conducted in 2015, 61 percent of young adults reported 
feeling optimistic about job opportunities, compared with 45 percent who felt that way in 2013.

But it also looks like the economic gains of the past few years are finally raising 

living standards for most people.  Median household income grew and poverty fell 

significantly in 2015, although these measures were still lagging their levels from before 

the recession.2  An improving economy may be especially important for you, as new 

graduates.  Those who graduate and enter the workforce during a strong economy are 

more likely to find employment, remain employed, and enjoy persistently higher 

earnings.3 

The second reason for optimism is that you have already done the one thing that 

research shows is most important to a successful and stable working life:  earning the 

degrees you will receive today.  Economists are not certain about many things.  But we 

are quite certain that a college diploma or an advanced degree is a key to economic 

success.  Those with a college degree are more likely to find a job, keep a job, have 

higher job satisfaction, and earn a higher salary.  The advantage in earnings is large.  

College grads’ annual earnings last year were, on average, 70 percent higher than those 

with only a high school diploma.  Back in 1980, the difference was only 20 percent.  The 

gap in earnings is significant only a few years after graduation--almost $18,000 a year, 

according to some recent data.  Beyond these advantages, research also shows that a 

college or graduate degree typically leads to a happier, healthier, and longer life.4  

One explanation for the greater advantage in recent decades conferred by higher 

education is that it reflects an increase in the demand for educated workers compared 

                                                 
2 For more on median household income adjusted for inflation and the poverty rate, see Posey (2016) and 
Bishaw and Glassman (2016). 
3 See, for example, Kahn (2010); Oreopoulos, Von Wachter, and Heisz (2012); and Altonji, Kahn, and 
Speer (2016).  
4 For recent estimates of the college earnings premium over time, see Pew Research (2014) and Council of 
Economic Advisers (2016).  For a discussion of some nonpecuniary benefits of completing college, see 
Oreopoulos and Salvanes (2011).

with others.  The drivers of this increasing demand for those with college and graduate 

degrees are likely to continue to be important.   Let me mention two of the most 

important factors.   

First, technology.  For decades, technological advances have increasingly allowed 

simpler, repetitive tasks to be done more cheaply and safely by machines.  This kind of 

work in factories, stores, and offices often required only a high school education.  At the 

same time, technological advances have increased demand for workers with the education 

necessary to perform the ever-growing share of jobs where technology is important.  

More recently, further advances are automating increasingly complex tasks and allowing 

workers with the ability and flexibility to use technology to be more productive.  Higher 

education has also changed in response, and one of the most important things many of 

you learned at the University of Baltimore was how to learn, adapt, and succeed in the 

technology-rich environment of most workplaces.   

The second major development in the job market is globalization, which allows 

goods and services to be produced wherever it is most economical.  Offshoring and trade 

have profoundly affected the U.S. economy.  No one knows which jobs and which 

industries will thrive as globalization continues or how each of you will be affected, but I 

can say that the education you have earned will provide an important advantage.  Like 

technological change, globalization has reinforced the shift away from lower-skilled jobs 

that require less education to higher-skilled jobs that require college and advanced 

degrees.  The jobs that globalization creates in the United States, serving a global 

economy of billions of people, are more likely to be filled by those who, like you, have 

secured the advantage of higher education.

While globalization will likely continue and technology will continue to advance, 

we don’t know how fast the economy will grow, what new technologies will be 

developed, or how quickly and consistently employment will expand.  What is 

considerably more certain, however, is that success will continue to be tied to education, 

in part because a good education enhances one’s ability to adapt to a changing economy. 

One reason for the increasing economic advantage of a college or graduate degree 

is the very slow growth of earnings in the last few decades for those with only a high 

school education.  It concerns me, as it should concern all of us, that many are falling 

behind.  Improvements in elementary and secondary education can help prepare more 

people for college and the opportunities college makes available, but for those who do 

not attend college, we must find other ways to extend economic opportunity to everyone 

in America.    

In discussing higher education, you may have noticed that I have spoken in terms 

of completing your degrees.  Research shows that a large share of the benefits I have 

described from higher education comes only to those who graduate.  Even those 

completing three or more years of college benefit much less when they don’t get a 

degree.5  For example, some of you may be worried about paying off loans you have 

taken out to pay for your education.  The good news is that the vast majority of student 

borrowers who complete their degrees find work that allows them to keep up with their 

payments and pay off their loans. 

Everything I have said so far could apply to the graduates this year of any college 

or university.  The rest of what I have to say is about you, the 2016 graduates of the 

                                                 
5 For example, see Oreopoulos and Petronijevic (2013) and Bound and Turner (2011).

University of Baltimore.  I have learned a bit about you recently, with the help of the 

university’s staff.  Let me tell you a few things about some of your classmates that you 

may not know.     

Among you today is a full-time student who found the time each semester to 

volunteer with non-profit organizations, including one that helps refugees from other 

countries find their place in this community.  Another of your fellow students, who used 

to doubt that she could ever afford college, has become a student leader.  She made the 

Dean’s List every semester after transferring from community college.  

Like many of you, another of your fellow graduates took day and evening classes 

to balance work and family demands.  She was forced to change jobs to accommodate 

this schedule.  She later decided her future lay in digital communications, which required 

her to switch majors after taking some required classes.  Today she will become the first 

person in her family to graduate from college.    

Some of you were born in other countries.  One of you lived in four other 

countries before coming to the University of Baltimore for a master’s degree.  Many of 

you have contributed to the sense of community at the University of Baltimore by 

actively participating in student life.  One of you has even decided to seek a career 

helping other students as a student affairs professional. 

These are a few of the outstanding people who will join you in walking across this 

stage today.  Let me describe one more. 

To that student, sitting in the audience, I would say: you deserve a tremendous 

amount of credit.  Based on what I have learned, you did not have all of the advantages 

that can pave the way to college and graduate school.  You overcame obstacles to make it

here, and more obstacles to complete your degree.  One of the biggest of these obstacles, 

in fact, was that some people doubted you could or would succeed.  But others in your 

life believed in you.  Some of them are here today.  They believed in you, and you 

believed in yourself, and your talent and intelligence and hard work enabled you to earn 

the degree you are about to receive.   

If this sounds like you, then you are absolutely right, because I am not describing 

just one member of the University of Baltimore’s Class of 2016--I am trying to describe 

every one of you.  In different ways, I expect all of you have overcome obstacles and 

demonstrated resilience and determination to succeed.  All of you have gained knowledge 

and used your intelligence and talents to complete your degrees.  As impressed as I am 

with any individual graduating today, I am more impressed with what all of you have 

achieved. 

Let me tell you what else I have learned.  More than the students of some colleges 

and universities, I know that many of you have deep roots in this city and in the county.  

Many of you will start careers, build your lives, and raise your families here.  The 

challenges you have overcome are the challenges faced by many people in Baltimore and 

in communities throughout America.  Your success, which we celebrate today, is also the 

promise of a brighter future for this city.  The degrees you have worked so hard to earn 

and the opportunities now opening up to you represent the stubborn, earnest hope that 

anyone and everyone who strives to succeed still can succeed.   

And that is why I consider it a rare privilege to speak to you today, and a great 

honor to be associated with the University of Baltimore and the members of the Class of 

2016.  Thank you, and congratulations.
