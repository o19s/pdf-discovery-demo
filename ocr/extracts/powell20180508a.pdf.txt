Thank you for inviting me to join you today as part of this distinguished panel.   

Our subject is the relationship between “center country” monetary policy and 

global financial conditions, and the policy implications of that relationship both for the 

center country and for other countries affected.  This broad topic has been the subject of a 

great deal of research and discussion in recent years.  Today I will focus in particular on 

the role of U.S. monetary policy in driving global financial conditions and capital flows.  

To preview my conclusions, I will argue that, while global factors play an important role 

in influencing domestic financial conditions, the role of U.S. monetary policy is often 

exaggerated.  And while financial globalization does pose some challenges for monetary 

policy, efforts to build stronger and more transparent policy frameworks and a more 

resilient financial system can reduce the adverse consequences of external shocks.   

The well-known Mundell-Fleming “trilemma” states that it is not possible to have 

all three of the following things:  free capital mobility, a fixed exchange rate, and the 

ability to pursue an independent monetary policy.  The trilemma does not say that a 

flexible exchange rate will always fully insulate domestic economic conditions from 

external shocks.1  And, indeed, that is not the case.  We have seen that integration of 

global capital markets can make for difficult tradeoffs for some economies, whether they 

have fixed or floating exchange rate regimes.   

Since the Fed is the central bank of the world’s largest economy and issuer of the 

world’s most widely used reserve currency, it is to be expected that the Fed’s policy 

actions will spill over to other economies.  To illustrate this point, the scatterplot on the 

left side of figure 1 focuses on movements in interest rates and exchange rates following 

                                                 
1 See, for example, Klein and Shambaugh (2013) and Obstfeld (2015).

Federal Reserve policy announcements.  As you can see, changes in U.S. interest rates 

after Fed policy actions (shown on the horizontal axis) lead to corresponding changes in 

the value of the dollar (shown on the vertical axis).  And because of the dollar’s 

widespread use around the world, these changes in the dollar affect financial conditions 

abroad.  Fed policy-related movements in U.S. bond yields also tend to spill over to bond 

yields abroad, such as the German yields shown in the scatterplot on the right.  Such 

spillovers are to be expected in a world of highly integrated financial markets.2  As figure 

2 shows, bond yields (left) and equity prices (right) around the world typically move 

together fairly closely.   

But the influence of U.S. monetary policy on global financial conditions should 

not be overstated.  The Federal Reserve is not the only central bank whose actions affect 

global financial markets.  In fact, the United States is the recipient as well as the 

originator of monetary policy spillovers.  For example, as seen in figure 3, changes in 

German yields after European Central Bank policy decisions also pass through to U.S. 

yields.3  More broadly, it is notable that although the Fed has raised its target interest rate 

six times since December 2015 and has begun to shrink its balance sheet, overall U.S. 

domestic financial conditions have gotten looser, in part due to improving global 

conditions and central bank policy abroad.   

Much of the discussion of the spillovers of U.S. monetary policy focuses on their 

effects on financial conditions in emerging market economies (EMEs).  Some observers 

                                                 
2 See, for example, Adrian and others (2017) and the IMF’s most recent Global Financial Stability Report 
(2018) for discussion of the transmission of global risk shocks to domestic macroeconomic conditions. 
3 Curcuru, De Pooter, and Eckerd (2018) find that about half of the movement in German bund yields in a 
window following ECB monetary policy announcements spills over to U.S. Treasury yields, roughly the 
same magnitude as the spillover of movements in U.S Treasury yields to German bund yields following 
Federal Reserve policy announcements.

have attributed the movements in international capital flowing to EMEs since the Global 

Financial Crisis primarily to monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy 

central banks.4  The data do not seem to me to fit this narrative particularly well.  As 

illustrated by the blue dashed line in the left panel of figure 4, capital flows to EMEs 

were already very strong before the Global Financial Crisis, when the federal funds rate 

was comparatively high.  The subsequent surge in capital flows in 2009, as the crisis was 

abating, largely reflects a rebound from the capital flow interruption during the crisis 

itself, though highly accommodative monetary policies in advanced economies doubtless 

also played a role.  Moreover, capital flows to EMEs started to ease after 2011, a period 

when the Federal Reserve continued to add accommodation and reduce yields through 

increases in its balance sheet, as shown in the right panel.  And, more recently, capital 

flows to EMEs have picked up again despite the fact that the Fed has been removing 

accommodation since 2015.  

If U.S. monetary policy is not the major determinant, what other factors have been 

driving EME capital flows?  One prominent factor has been growth differentials between 

EMEs and advanced economies.  In figure 5, the left panel shows that capital inflows to 

EMEs picked up post-crisis, in line with the widening of this growth differential, while 

the slowdown in inflows after 2011 coincides with its narrowing.  Another related 

determinant has been commodity prices, as shown in the right panel.  The pickup in both 

global growth and commodity prices over the past couple of years explains a good part of 

the recent recovery of capital flows to EMEs.5 

                                                 
4 See, for example, Wheatley and Garnham (2010) and Rajan (2014). 
5 Studies looking at the determinants of EME capital flows include Chari and others (2017), Clark and 
others (2016), Bems and others (2016), Koepke (2015), Ahmed and Zlate (2014), Fratzscher (2012), and

Monetary stimulus by the Fed and other advanced-economy central banks played 

a relatively limited role in the surge of capital flows to EMEs in recent years.  There is 

good reason to think that the normalization of monetary policies in advanced economies 

should continue to prove manageable for EMEs.  Fed policy normalization has proceeded 

without disruption to financial markets, and market participants’ expectations for policy 

(the red symbols in figure 6) seem reasonably well aligned with policymakers’ 

expectations in the Summary of Economic Projections (the black dots), suggesting that 

markets should not be surprised by our actions if the economy evolves in line with 

expectations.   

It also bears emphasizing that the EMEs themselves have made considerable 

progress in reducing vulnerabilities since the crisis-prone 1980s and 1990s.  Many EMEs 

have substantially improved their fiscal and monetary policy frameworks while adopting 

more flexible exchange rates, a policy that recent research shows provides better 

insulation from external financial shocks.6  Corporate debt at risk--the debt of firms with 

limited debt service capacity--has been rising in EMEs, as shown in figure 7.7  But this 

rise has been relatively limited outside of China and has begun to reverse as stronger 

global growth has pushed up earnings.    

                                                 
Ghosh and others (2012).  These papers generally conclude that many factors, including both “pull” and 
“push,” affect EME capital flows.  
6 See, for example, Obstfeld, Ostry, and Qureshi (2017).  The results in IMF (2017) also indicate that while 
global financial conditions explain a significant portion of countries’ domestic financial conditions, 
domestic monetary policy changes also play an important role in economies with flexible exchange rates.   
7 The interest coverage ratio (ICR) is the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and 
amortization to interest expense.  A value of 2 or less is typically associated with an increased likelihood of 
distress.  For example, just before the Asian financial crisis, firms in Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia had an 
average ICR of 2; see Pomerleano (1998).   
     For more on evolution of EME debt at risk and vulnerabilities, see Powell (2017).

All that said, I do not dismiss the prospective risks emanating from global policy 

normalization.  Some investors and institutions may not be well positioned for a rise in 

interest rates, even one that markets broadly anticipate.  And, of course, future economic 

conditions may surprise us, as they often do.   

  Moreover, the linkages among monetary policy, asset prices, and the mood of 

global financial markets are not fully understood.  Some observers have argued that U.S. 

monetary policy also influences capital flows through its effects on global risk sentiment, 

with looser policy leading to more positive sentiment in markets and tighter policy 

depressing sentiment.8  While those channels may well operate, research at both the Fed 

and the IMF suggests that actions by major central banks account for only a relatively 

small fraction of global financial volatility and capital flow movements.9 

Nevertheless, risk sentiment will bear close watching as normalization proceeds 

around the world.  What can the Federal Reserve do to foster continued financial stability 

and economic growth as normalization proceeds?  We will communicate our policy 

strategy as clearly and transparently as possible to help align expectations and avoid 

market disruptions.  And we will continue to help build resilience in the financial system 

and support global efforts to do the same.

9 For example, Londono and Wilson (2018) find that U.S. monetary policy variables account for only 
roughly 10 percent of the six-month ahead forecast error variance of the VIX.  In fact, in their study, non-
U.S. global factors (non-U.S industrial production, a global Economic Policy Uncertainty Index, and the 
expected probability of recessions outside of the United States) explain nearly as much of the VIX forecast 
error variance as U.S. monetary policy and other U.S. variables combined.  In addition, Cerutti, Claessens, 
and Rose (2017) find that directly observed variables in “center” countries (including VIX), as well as 
unobserved common dynamic factors extracted from actual capital flows, together rarely explain more than 
one-fourth of the variation in most types of capital flows.
