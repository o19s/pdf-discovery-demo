I want to thank the Brookings Institution for inviting me to comment today on 

Martin Wheatley’s presentation on the Fair and Effective Markets Review (Review). 1 

The Review is an ambitious and important initiative.  Although London is perhaps the 

leading center for many fixed-income, currency, and commodities (FICC) markets, these 

markets are global, and the United States and the largest U.S. firms play key roles in 

them.  So the Review addresses issues that affect our markets as well.   

The Review looks to identify further steps that should be taken to restore public 

confidence in FICC markets in the wake of the depressingly numerous instances of 

serious misconduct in these markets in recent years.  That misconduct has been, and will 

continue to be, addressed through substantial fines and criminal prosecution of the firms 

and individuals involved.  The Federal Reserve continues to take part in these 

enforcement actions in cooperation with other U.S. agencies.    

The design of the Review is not only to advance the enforcement process, but also 

to look carefully at markets and firms and ask whether there are structural vulnerabilities 

or incentives for bad conduct that have not been well addressed by reforms to date.  I will 

offer comments on a few specific areas and discuss some of our parallel efforts here in 

the United States.   

First, as the Review notes, there is a perception that FICC markets and their 

participants are highly sophisticated and do not need protection.  While that may be 

generally true, the perspective is too narrow, because the importance of these markets 

extends far beyond the largest participants in them.  The market mechanism allocates 

credit and determines the borrowing costs of households, companies and governments.

Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.

Proper market functioning is really a public good that relies on confidence and trust 

among market participants and the public.  Bad conduct, weak internal firm governance, 

misaligned incentives, and flawed market structure can all place this trust at risk. 

One of the ways we have to influence incentives is through compensation 

practices at supervised institutions.  Many have argued that pre-crisis compensation 

practices at the largest financial firms allowed or created misaligned incentives.  In 

response, many firms have changed their compensation practices since the crisis to better 

align incentives between individuals and firms, particularly through enhanced deferral of 

incentive compensation, with delayed vesting and the possibility of more robust forfeiture 

in a broader set of circumstances.  We have strongly encouraged these reforms in our 

supervision of these institutions.  In my view, the reforms are both essential and generally 

on target.  The U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, are also preparing 

for public comment a proposed new rule on incentive compensation that will codify and 

strengthen these initiatives.  

As the Review notes, greater transparency can also help curb market abuses and 

strengthen competition.  In the United States, we have had over a decade of experience 

with the Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) in over-the-counter 

corporate bond, MBS and ABS markets.  The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board 

provides similar data for municipal bonds.  The Dodd-Frank Act also imposed rules 

requiring greater transparency in over-the-counter derivatives markets through the use of 

central clearing, trade repositories, and swap execution facilities.  Given the issues 

around OTC derivatives during the recent crisis, these clearly are important initiatives.  

But despite significant progress, there are still a number of impediments to sharing trade

report data across regulatory agencies and jurisdictions, leaving us with only a piecemeal 

picture of the overall market rather than the full transparency that we desire.  

The issues around foreign exchange (FX) benchmarks serve to illustrate one of 

the important challenges discussed in the Review--the difficulty of managing the 

potential conflicts of interest associated with the traditional market-maker model.  In FX 

markets, a wide range of end users seek to guarantee trade execution at the WM Reuters 

fixing at 4:00 p.m. U.K. time each day.  This practice results in dealers having advance 

information about flows, and at the same time places them at some risk, as they are 

agreeing to execute these orders at an unknown future price.  This advance information 

can create a perception that dealers are trading ahead of their clients, and it certainly 

created incentives to attempt to influence the fixing price.  The recent Financial Stability 

Board (FSB) report on foreign exchange benchmarks2 made a number of 

recommendations designed to address these issues in this specific market, including use 

of trading platforms to maximize the netting of fixing orders, encouraging dealers to 

charge a transparent bid-asked spread or other fee to compensate them for the risk they 

take, and strengthening dealers’ internal systems and controls to better manage potential 

conflicts of interest.   

Of course, similar challenges exist with market-making in other FICC markets.    

Many firms have taken up these challenges with their own reforms, and their efforts serve 

to emphasize how complicated these issues can be.  Dealers must communicate with 

other firms, within their own firms and with their clients, and must execute their clients’

trades.  The challenge is to identify and preserve the legitimate benefits of such 

communication and trading while safeguarding against improper uses of information.    It 

may be that these challenges can be addressed through coordinated private efforts; for 

example, through such bodies as the Foreign Exchange Committee and the Treasury 

Market Practices Group, sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  These 

groups are actively working on industry best practices in their markets and have often 

played a constructive role on market practices that enhance market functioning.  It may 

also be that further supervisory or regulatory action is needed.   

Turning to our work on interest rate benchmark reform, it is worth recalling that, 

before the scandal broke, the London interbank offered rate (LIBOR) was not regulated.  

U.K. authorities have now addressed this shortcoming by making both the submission 

and administration of LIBOR regulated activities.  The process by which firms make their 

LIBOR submissions is now subject to careful monitoring.  The new LIBOR 

administrator, ICE Benchmark Administration, now regulated by the Financial Conduct 

Authority, is evaluating changes to LIBOR so that it can be based as much as possible on 

actual arm’s-length transactions from a broader base of funding transactions. 

With surveillance and penalties in place, and a new administrator, one might be 

excused for thinking that there is nothing more to be done.  In fact, some people do think 

that.  That is emphatically not the view of the FSB Official Sector Steering Group that I 

now co-chair with Martin, which concluded that it is essential to develop one or more risk 

free (or near risk free) alternatives to LIBOR for use in financial contracts such as interest 

rate derivatives.  The reasons are related to the structure of both LIBOR and the market 

that underlies it.  Unsecured interbank borrowing has been in a secular decline for some 


 - 5 - 

time, and there is a scarcity, or outright absence in longer tenors, of actual transactions 

that banks can use to estimate their daily submission to LIBOR or that can be used by 

others to verify those submissions.   LIBOR is huge--there are roughly $300 trillion in 

gross notional contracts that reference it--so the incentives to manipulate it still remain in 

place.  And the structural problems go much further than the incentives for manipulation.  

Markets need to be fair, effective, and also safe.  If the publication of LIBOR were to 

become untenable because the number of transactions that underlie it declined further, 

then untangling the outstanding LIBOR contracts would entail a legal mess that could 

endanger our financial stability.   

For these reasons, the Federal Reserve has convened a group of the largest global 

dealers to form the Alternative Reference Rates Committee.  We have asked them to 

work with us in promoting alternatives to U.S. dollar LIBOR that better reflect the 

current structure of funding markets.  As the Review’s consultation document notes, 

issues of this kind are really global in nature; U.S. dollar LIBOR contracts are traded 

throughout the world, not simply in the United States. For this reason we are working in 

close consultation with our foreign regulatory counterparts in this endeavor.  

One of the reasons that I emphasize structural issues such as the market-maker 

model or the secular decline in unsecured interbank borrowing is that FICC markets are 

undergoing rapid changes that seem likely to have far-ranging consequences.  Issues that 

a few years ago concerned equity markets now arise in FICC markets as well.  As the 

consultation document notes, broker-dealers are curtailing some of their market-making 

activities and their appetite for providing liquidity in response to regulatory changes and 

their own assessment of the risks and returns of these activities.  At the same time, other 


 - 6 - 

players such as mutual funds, exchange traded funds, algorithmic and high-frequency 

traders, and electronic exchanges are taking more prominent roles.  These changes will 

affect market liquidity and functioning in ways that are difficult to foresee.  It is possible 

that some of these factors played a role in the sharp swing in Treasury yields last October 

15, and we are working with other regulators to understand exactly what happened that 

day and to determine whether there are implications for regulatory or supervisory policy.   

The Review raises the right questions in considering the troubling patterns of 

market abuse, and also in considering the structural changes that we are now seeing.  It is 

important that market participants, end users, and regulators collectively take a step back 

and consider, as the Review invites us to do, whether the changing structure of FICC 

markets will result in markets that are fair, effective, and safe.
