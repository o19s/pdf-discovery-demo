I see some familiar faces in the audience, and I am delighted to be at Peterson 

today to offer my first public remarks since being sworn in last month as Vice Chairman 

of the Federal Reserve Board.  As some of you know, I have been a student of U.S. 

monetary policy for more than 30 years.  So, for me, personally, it is a distinct honor and 

real privilege to have the opportunity to serve with my colleagues on the Board of 

Governors and, along with the 12 Reserve Bank presidents, on the Federal Open Market 

Committee (FOMC).   

Now, of course, I fully realize that I have participated in just one FOMC meeting 

to date, so my remarks today will not come with a patina earned from long experience as 

a monetary policymaker.  That said, I thought it might be of interest to share my thinking 

on the current state of the U.S. economy, to explain how it informed my support for the 

FOMC’s policy decision last month, and to discuss my views on the way forward for 

U.S. monetary policy.1 

The Economic Expansion in Year 10  

The U.S. economic expansion, now in its 10th year, is marked by strong growth in 

the gross domestic product (GDP) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside 

for nearly two years.  It is impossible today to know with much precision how much of 

the pickup in growth and the decline in unemployment that we have seen over the past 

two years is structural and how much is cyclical.  Most likely, both factors are at work.  

That said, based on my reading of the accumulating evidence, I believe that trend growth

in the economy may well be faster and the structural rate of unemployment lower than I 

would have thought several years ago.  Let me elaborate. 

First, let’s look at the demand side of the economy.  Consider the benchmark 

revisions to the household saving rate.  Recently revised Commerce Department data 

now show that the aggregate household saving rate is running at 6.7 percent of disposable 

income.  This revised estimate is nearly double the previous estimate.  The higher level 

suggests that, in contrast to the previous economic expansion from 2001 to 2007, when 

households were borrowing to maintain consumption while income growth slowed, 

households today, at least in the aggregate, are well positioned to maintain or even 

increase consumption relative to gains in income.  To me, at this stage in the business 

cycle, a historically high household saving rate is a tailwind for the economy, not a 

headwind.  And, of course, recent reductions in personal income tax rates are also a 

tailwind for the economy. 

Productivity and investment data provide another vantage point from which to 

assess both the demand and supply sides of the current expansion.  Over the past few 

years, we have seen some pickup in productivity growth, albeit from a very depressed 

pace.  By contrast, at a comparable stage in both the 2001-07 and 1982-90 economic 

expansions, productivity growth (as measured by an eight-quarter moving average) was 

actually slowing relative to its contemporaneous peak-to-present pace.   

I should also note that this recent pickup in productivity has coincided with a 

rebound in business investment, and that this increase in capital spending has been 

evident in both the equipment and intellectual property categories; it is not just an “oil 

patch” story.  Business investment is being supported by recent changes in the tax code

that lower the cost of capital as well as by continued strong profitability of U.S. 

companies.  While capital investment is one important source of productivity growth and 

recent data on this front are encouraging, predicting future--or even identifying 

past--inflection points in productivity growth is notoriously difficult.  Although it may be 

tempting simply to extrapolate a decade of disappointing productivity data into a distant 

future, a pickup in trend productivity growth is a possibility that deserves close 

monitoring.2   

Let me now turn to the job market and inflation outlook.  Average monthly job 

gains continue to outpace the increase needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the 

labor force over the longer run.  At 3.7 percent in September, the unemployment rate has 

not been this low since 1969.  In addition, after remaining stubbornly sluggish throughout 

much of the expansion, wage growth is picking up.  A sustained rise in inflation-adjusted, 

or “real,” wages at or above the pace of productivity growth is typical in an economy 

operating in the vicinity of full employment, and we are starting to see some evidence of 

this.  I certainly hope it continues.  Now, some might see a rise in wages as leading to 

upside inflationary pressures, but here, again, the experience of earlier cycles is 

instructive.  In the past two U.S. expansions, gains in real wages in excess of productivity 

growth were not accompanied by a material rise in price inflation.  

Of course, this time may be different, and as with growth, the job market could 

perform better or worse than the baseline outlook.  However, for now, the increase in 

wages has been broadly consistent with the pickup in productivity growth that I have just

discussed, and a rise in the still-low rate of labor force participation among the prime-age 

population provides scope for the job market to strengthen further without generating 

inflationary pressures. 

This outlook for the labor market also reflects my view that the structural, or 

longer-run, rate of unemployment--that is, the unemployment rate consistent with stable 

inflation over the longer run--may be somewhat lower than I would have thought several 

years ago.  What this means is that, even with today’s very low unemployment rate, the 

labor market might not be as tight--and inflationary pressures not as strong--as I once 

would have thought.  I am certainly not alone in this thinking.  Over the past several 

years, most FOMC participants have been reducing their individual estimates of the 

longer-run level of the unemployment rate.  The median assessment of FOMC 

participants fell from around 5-1/2 percent five years ago to 4-1/2 percent in the 

projections published last month.  Outside estimates, such as those from the 

Congressional Budget Office and the Blue Chip Economic Indicators survey, show a 

similar pattern of downward revisions.  This makes sense.  With unemployment falling 

and wage gains thus far in line with productivity and expected inflation, the traditional 

indicators of cost-push price pressure are not flashing red right now.   

 Both total and core personal consumption expenditure inflation are now running 

close to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective.  When thinking about the inflation outlook, I 

pay attention to market-based measures of inflation compensation from the TIPS 

(Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) market as well as to surveys of inflation 

expectations.  These “breakeven inflation rates” are simply the difference between yields 

on traditional Treasury securities and those on TIPS with comparable maturities.  While

these market-based measures are not perfect and need to be adjusted for liquidity and 

term premium factors, they can provide a useful signal about market inflation 

expectations, which can be combined with signals from surveys of expected inflation to 

get a read on inflation expectations.  Breakeven inflation rates have only recently risen to 

a range that is in line--but just barely--with the expectation that inflation will remain 

close to our 2 percent inflation goal over the medium-to-longer run.  Survey-based 

measures of inflation expectations also appear consistent with the Fed’s inflation goal.   

In short, the labor market today is robust, and inflation is at or close to the Fed’s 

2 percent inflation goal.  Thus, the economy is as near as it has been in a decade to 

meeting both of the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives, which suggests to me that monetary 

policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining growth and 

employment at levels consistent with keeping inflation at or close to the 2 percent rate 

consistent with price stability.  By contrast, until this year, the appropriate focus of policy 

had been to return employment and inflation to levels consistent with our dual-mandate 

objectives.  With the economy now operating at or close to mandate-consistent levels for 

inflation and unemployment, the risks that monetary policy must balance are now more 

symmetric and less skewed to the downside. 

Policy Remains Accommodative 

I supported the FOMC’s decision last month to raise the target for the federal 

funds rate to a range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent.  With the economy growing briskly, the labor 

market operating in the vicinity of full employment, and inflation running close to 

2 percent, I saw our decision as another step in removing the extraordinary degree of 

accommodation put in place in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis.  However, 


 - 6 - 

even after our September decision, I believe U.S. monetary policy remains 

accommodative.  The funds rate is just now--for the first time in a decade--above the 

Fed’s inflation objective, but the inflation-adjusted real funds rate remains below the 

range of estimates for the longer-run neutral real rate, often referred to as r*,  computed 

from the projections submitted by Board members and the Reserve Bank presidents.   

This longer-run r*, like the natural rate of unemployment, is both unobserved and 

time varying--and thus must be inferred as a signal extracted from noisy macro and 

financial data.  That said, and notwithstanding the imprecision with which r* is estimated, 

it remains to me a relevant consideration as I assess the current stance and best path 

forward for policy.  The reason for this is because, as Milton Friedman argued in his 

classic American Economic Association presidential address, a central bank that seeks to 

consistently keep real interest rates below r* will eventually face rising inflation and 

inflation expectations, while a central bank that seeks to keep real interest rates above r* 

will eventually face falling inflation and inflation expectations.3  My own and others’ 

research suggests that the failure of the Fed to respect this principle contributed to the 

Great Inflation of the 1970s, while the incorporation of this principle into Fed policy in 

the 1990s and 2000s contributed to the achievement of stable and low inflation during 

and since those years.4  So, even though estimates of r* are imprecise, I do not believe

they should be ignored.  Instead, when thinking about monetary policy, I believe it is best 

not to ignore entirely an admittedly imprecise estimate of r* today, but instead to update 

that estimate as new data on inflation, inflation expectations, employment, growth, and 

productivity arrive.   

Moreover, because monetary policy operates with a lag, and with inflation 

presently close to the 2 percent goal, it will be especially important to monitor inflation 

expectations closely--using both surveys and financial market data--to best calibrate the 

pace and destination for policy normalization.  It will also be important to monitor both 

model-based and financial-market-based estimates of expected future inflation-indexed 

real interest rates (for example, 5-year real rates 5 years forward)--suitably adjusted for 

term premium and liquidity effects--as one indicator of longer-run r*.  Before the 

financial crisis, these 5-year real rates 5 years forward averaged around 2 percent after a 

term premium and liquidity adjustment.  Since 2015, they have averaged about 0.50 

percent but recently have approached 0.75 percent, also after a term and liquidity 

premium adjustment.  Given that real interest rates and economic growth tend to move 

together over the longer run, one possible source of these upward revisions in forward 

real rates could be that financial market participants may have become more optimistic 

about the growth potential of our economy.  Evidence also suggests that the term 

premium that investors require to hold longer-maturity bonds has risen as well. 

The Way Forward 

If the data come in as I expect, I believe that some further gradual adjustment in 

the federal funds rate will be appropriate.  As I mentioned earlier, I believe monetary 

policy today remains accommodative, and that, with the economy now operating at or 


 - 8 - 

close to mandate-consistent levels for inflation and unemployment, the risks that 

monetary policy must balance are now more symmetric and less skewed to the downside.  

Raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the economic expansion while 

moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and inflation expectations down the 

road that could be costly to reverse.   

As I calibrate, in the months ahead, the pace and ultimate destination for 

monetary policy adjustments that will best allow the Fed to achieve its dual-mandate 

objectives, it will be important to me to evaluate a wide range of economic and financial 

market indicators to complement the predictions yielded by model-based scenarios.  As I 

look ahead, if strong growth and robust employment gains were to continue into 2019 

and be accompanied by a material rise in actual and expected inflation, that circumstance 

would indicate to me that additional policy normalization might well be required beyond 

what I currently expect.  By contrast, if strong growth and employment gains were to 

continue and be accompanied by stable inflation, inflation expectations, and expectations 

for Fed policy, that situation, to me, would argue against raising short-term interest rates 

by more than I currently expect.  

Conclusion 

In closing, with the economy operating as close as it has in a decade to the 

Federal Reserve’s dual-mandate objectives of price stability and maximum employment, 

I believe monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at 

sustaining growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with keeping inflation 

at or close to the 2 percent objective.  Even after our most recent policy decision to raise 

the range for the federal funds rate by 1/4 percentage point, monetary policy remains 


 - 9 - 

accommodative, and I believe some further gradual adjustment in the policy rate range 

will likely be appropriate.  That said, at this stage in the business cycle, I believe it will 

be especially important to monitor a wide range of data to continually assess and calibrate 

the level of the policy rate that is consistent with meeting our objectives on a sustained 

basis.
