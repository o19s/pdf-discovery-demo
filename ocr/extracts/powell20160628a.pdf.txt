Thank you for this opportunity to speak here today.  The Chicago Council on 

Global Affairs has been a thought leader for nearly a century, encouraging public 

discourse, education, and research on important global issues.  The Council’s global 

focus is particularly important for understanding the challenges facing the U.S. economy 

today, as shown by last week’s referendum on the United Kingdom’s status in the 

European Union.  In my remarks, I will review recent economic developments and the 

outlook for the economy.  I will also discuss the economy’s longer-term productive 

potential.  As always, the view I express here today are my own.  

The Dual Mandate and State of the Economy 

As you know, the Federal Reserve, through the Federal Open Market Committee 

(FOMC), is charged by the Congress with achieving maximum employment and stable 

prices--the dual mandate.  For price stability, the FOMC has adopted a goal of 2 percent 

for inflation, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal 

consumption expenditures.  Many other central banks in developed economies have 

adopted inflation goals centered around 2 percent.   

The FOMC has not set a numerical goal for maximum employment, because the 

long-run sustainable level of employment is determined mainly by non-monetary factors 

that are outside the Fed’s control, such as demographics, social change, and fiscal and 

regulatory policies.  Nonetheless, four times a year, FOMC participants write down their 

estimates of the longer-run sustainable level of the unemployment rate (which many 

interpret as the “natural rate”); at the recent June FOMC meeting the median estimate of 

that rate was 4.8 percent.

How should we evaluate our current performance against the dual mandate?  I 

would say that we have made substantial progress toward maximum employment, 

although there is still some room for improvement.  We have more work to do to assure 

that inflation moves back up to our 2 percent goal.   

Let’s start with the employment mandate.  After several years of strong job 

growth, employment is now over 5 million higher than the pre-crisis peak in 2007.  The 

unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent in 2009 to 4.7 percent in May, essentially 

at the level that many observers identify as the natural rate.  This rate is very far from a 

bright line--it cannot be observed directly, and estimates of its level are subject to great 

uncertainty.1  So we look to a wide range of labor market indicators to assess the overall 

health of the labor market.  Many of those indicators suggest that the labor market is 

strong.  To mention a few of these, job openings are at an all-time high by some 

measures.  The “quits” rate--the rate at which employees voluntarily leave their jobs--is 

about at pre-crisis levels. Surveys of individuals and businesses suggest that the ease of 

finding and filling jobs is similar to that experienced in the mid-2000s. 

Even though we are near the natural rate of unemployment, there is still room for 

improvement on several margins.  Important among these is the labor force participation 

rate.  If someone leaves the labor force for any reason, even temporarily, that person is 

not counted as unemployed.  So the labor force participation rate is also a key 

determinant of the unemployment rate.  Labor force participation is influenced by many 

                                                   
1 Confidence intervals around statistical estimates of the natural rate are routinely estimated to be quite 
wide, reflecting both uncertainty about the correct model specification as well as uncertainty about the 
parameter estimates given the model.  The canonical paper by Douglas Staiger, James H. Stock and Mark 
W. Watson (1997), “How Precise are Estimates of the Natural Rate of Unemployment?,” in Christina D. 
Romer and David H. Romer, eds., Reducing Inflation: Motivation and Strategy (Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press) puts the 95 percent confidence interval at 1½ percentage points on either side of the point 
estimate.

factors, including the age structure of the population and individuals’ perceptions of the 

availability of jobs. 

Participation rose steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s as increasing 

numbers of women entered the formal workforce.  That process ran its course, and, 

around the year 2000, participation began a gradual decline because of population aging 

and the continuation of other long-term trends, particularly the decline in participation 

among prime age males.  From 2008 through 2013, participation dropped sharply by 3 

percentage points, but has remained about flat, on net, since late 2013 in a context of 

strong job growth and declining unemployment.  Economists estimate that, as the 

population ages, participation will naturally tend to decline at a trend rate of about 0.2 

percentage point per year, so this period of flat participation actually represents an 

improvement against the post-crisis cyclical drop.  Today, participation is near its longer-

run trend as estimated by a group of Fed economists whose work is widely cited on these 

issues.2  Some other estimates suggest that there is still a shortfall in participation, and, of 

course, estimates of the trend participation rate are surrounded by fairly wide bands of 

uncertainty.  I am inclined to believe that there are potential workers at the margins of the 

labor market who will return as the recovery continues, the labor market tightens further 

and wages increase.  The U.S. participation rate for workers in the 25-54 age group is 

now below those of most other advanced economies, including the U.K., France and 

Germany, for example.

The number of part-time workers who want full time work remains above pre-

crisis levels, which suggests that there may be some remaining slack there as well.  In 

addition, we should expect to see stronger wage increases as the labor market tightens.  

There are welcome signs of a firming in wages, seen most clearly in the data on average 

hourly earnings, which are rising faster than the sum of inflation and productivity growth. 

After several years of improving labor market conditions, recent data have been 

sending mixed signals on the level of momentum in the economy.  Business investment 

has weakened, even outside the energy sector.  Growth in gross domestic product (GDP) 

is estimated to have slowed to a rate of only 1-1/4 percent on an annualized basis over the 

fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year.  Incoming data do point to a 

rebound.  For example, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model, which bases its projection on 

a range of incoming monthly data, estimates growth of 2.6 percent in the second quarter.  

In contrast, the labor market data, especially the monthly increase in payroll jobs, after 

displaying considerable strength for several years right through the first quarter of 2016, 

weakened significantly in April and May.  While I would not want to make too much of 

two monthly observations, the strength of the labor market has been a key feature of the 

recovery, allowing us to look through quarterly fluctuations in GDP growth.  So the 

possible loss of momentum in job growth is worrisome.        

Turning to the inflation part of the mandate, the Fed’s preferred measure of 

inflation has consistently run below our 2 percent objective since the end of the financial 

crisis, with the exception of the “Arab Spring” period in 2011, when oil prices 

temporarily spiked.  For the 12 months ending in April, total inflation was only 1 percent, 

while core inflation (excluding food and energy prices) was 1-1/2 percent.  Core inflation 


 - 5 - 

has been held down by falling import prices, owing in large part to the rise in the dollar, 

as well as the indirect effects of lower oil prices.  If the dollar and oil prices remain 

broadly stable going forward, inflation should move up over time to our 2 percent 

objective.   

When I was first exposed to macroeconomics in college, more than four decades 

ago, the view was that inflation was strongly influenced by the amount of slack in the 

economy.  But the relationship between slack and inflation has weakened substantially 

over the years.  In addition, inflation depends importantly on the inflation expectations of 

workers and firms.  A widely shared view among economists today is that, unlike during 

the 1970s, expectations are no longer heavily influenced by fluctuations in inflation, but 

are fairly constant, or anchored.  For both these reasons, inflation has become less 

responsive to cyclical changes in the economy.  We measure inflation expectations 

through surveys of forecasters and the general public, and also through market readings 

on inflation swaps and “breakevens,” which represent inflation compensation as 

measured by the difference between the return offered by nominal Treasury securities and 

that offered by TIPS.  Since mid-2014, these market-based measures have declined 

significantly to historically low levels.  Some of this decline probably represents lower 

risk of high inflation, or an elevated liquidity preference for much more heavily traded 

nominal Treasury securities, rather than expectations of lower inflation.  Some survey 

measures of inflation expectations have also trended down.  Given the importance of 

expectations for determining inflation, these developments deserve, and receive, careful 

attention.  While inflation expectations seem to me to remain reasonably well anchored, it 


 - 6 - 

is essential that they remain so.  The only way to assure that anchoring is to achieve 

actual inflation of 2 percent, and I am strongly committed to that objective.   

Looking Ahead 

My baseline expectation has been that our economy is likely to continue on its 

path of growth at around 2 percent.  I have also expected the ongoing healing in labor 

markets to continue, with healthy wage increases and job creation.  As the economy 

tightens, I have expected that inflation will move up over time to the Committee’s 2 

percent objective.   

For some time, the principal risks to that outlook have been from abroad.  Global 

economic and financial conditions are particularly important for the U.S. economy at the 

moment.  Weakness in economic activity around the world and related bouts of financial 

volatility have weighed on the performance of our economy.  Given the stronger 

performance of the U.S. economy, the trade-weighted value of the dollar has risen 

roughly 20 percent since 2014.  Such a large appreciation of the dollar means that we will 

“export” some of our strength to our trading partners and “import” some of their 

weakness.   

Growth and inflation remain stubbornly low for most of our major trading 

partners.  European and Japanese authorities have limited scope to respond, with daunting 

longer-run fiscal challenges and policy rates already set below zero.  In China, stimulus 

measures should support growth in the near term, but may also slow China’s necessary 

transition away from its export- and investment-led business model.  Emerging market 

nations such as Brazil, Russia and Venezuela face challenging conditions.   

These global risks have now shifted even further to the downside, with last 

week’s referendum on the United Kingdom’s status in the European Union.  The Brexit 

vote has the potential to create new headwinds for economies around the world, including 


 - 7 - 

our own.  The risks to the global outlook were somewhat elevated even prior to the 

referendum, and the vote has introduced new uncertainties.  We have said that the Federal 

Reserve is carefully monitoring developments in global financial markets, in cooperation 

with other central banks.  We are prepared to provide dollar liquidity through our existing 

swap lines with central banks, as necessary, to address pressures in global funding 

markets, which could have adverse implications for our economy.  Although financial 

conditions have tightened since the vote, markets have been functioning in an orderly 

manner.  And the U.S. financial sector is strong and resilient.  As our recent stress tests 

show, our largest financial institutions continue to build their capital and strengthen their 

balance sheets.   

It is far too early to judge the effects of the Brexit vote.  As the global outlook 

evolves, it will be important to assess the implications for the U.S. economy, and for the 

stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives of 

maximum employment and price stability. 

I am often asked why rates remain so low now that we are near full employment.  

A big part of the answer is that, at least for the time being, the appropriate level of rates is 

simply lower than it was before the crisis.  As a result, policy is not as stimulative as it 

might appear to be.  Estimates of the real interest rate needed to keep the economy on an 

even keel if it were operating at 2 percent inflation and full employment--the “neutral 

rate” of interest--are currently around zero.  Today, the real short term interest rate is 

about negative 1-1/4 percent, so policy is actually only moderately stimulative.  I 

anticipate that the neutral rate will move up over time, as some of the headwinds that 

have weighed on economic growth ease.

Longer-term Considerations: Potential output, productivity, labor market fluidity, 

and business dynamism 

I would like to take a step back from the current context and explore an issue that 

ought to receive more attention--the longer-run potential growth rate of our economy.  

One reason for the low neutral rate of interest is that potential growth appears to have 

slowed.  Since the crisis ended, forecasters have broadly reduced their estimates of longer 

run growth by a full percentage point--from about 3 percent to about 2 percent.3 This 

seemingly modest reduction implies dramatically smaller increases in living standards 

over time.  A growing body of research shows that deep recessions accompanied by 

severe financial crises often leave behind permanent damage.4  One recent analysis 

suggests that in about one-third of such cases there is no permanent damage; one-third of 

the time there is a permanent reduction in the level of potential output but not its 

subsequent growth rate; and one third of the time there is a reduction in both the level of 

potential output and in the growth rate.5  Unfortunately, many economies are currently in 

danger of falling into the third category, including the U.S. economy. 

Output growth can be broken down into increases in hours worked and changes in 

output per hour, or productivity.  Most of the decline in estimated potential U.S. growth 

appears to be from lower productivity.  Labor productivity growth began to slow around 

2005--before the crisis--and been only 1/2 percent annually since 2011--the slowest five

year period since World War II.  The productivity slowdown has been worldwide, and 

has been seen in countries that were not as strongly affected by the crisis, so U.S. specific 

factors are probably not the main cause.6   

Increasing productivity is necessary if living standards are to continue to rise over 

generations.  So two important questions arise:  Why has productivity growth been so 

slow?  And what does the future look like? 

We have tentative answers to the first question.  Labor productivity is a function 

of three things.  The first two are the skills of the labor force, and the tools they have, 

particularly equipment, software and the like.  These are inputs to production and are 

driven by private and public investment.  The third determinant is called “total factor 

productivity,” or TFP, which refers to the ability of firms to produce more efficiently 

given the first two inputs.  For example, as businesses learned how to incorporate 

advances in information technology into their production processes, there was a surge of 

productivity growth from roughly 1995 to 2005.   

The weak performance of productivity since the crisis appears to stem mainly 

from weak business investment and low TFP growth.  Weak business investment has 

resulted from weak demand and uncertainty about the pace of the recovery.  TFP is 

equally important and has generally accounted for most of the variation in productivity 

over time, but is less well understood and so more difficult to forecast.   

The second question--what will happen with productivity going forward--is the 

subject of intense debate.  The range of forecasts is wide, and the historical record

provides ample ground for humility.  This summer, many will be carrying Robert 

Gordon’s massive The Rise and Fall of American Growth to the beach (or perhaps to the 

lake, here in the Midwest), which argues the pessimistic view. 7  For balance, maybe 

bring along Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s The Second Machine Age, which take a more 

optimistic view and is a great deal shorter.8 

One factor that may contribute to low productivity growth is the notable decline 

in recent decades in measures of the dynamism of our economy.  Entrepreneurs start new 

firms; most of them fail, but a few of them succeed, grow very rapidly, and account for 

significant amounts of job formation.  Older firms shrink or go out of business if they fail 

to keep up with innovation and advances in productivity.  Workers change jobs and move 

around the country (or the world) as their careers evolve and as companies grow and 

shrink.  These processes can be painful and messy for both workers and firms, but they 

are essential to the allocation of resources to their highest, most productive uses.  The 

high levels of innovation and fluidity of our economy have long been thought to be 

among the principal reasons for our high and rising living standards.   

The slowdown in essentially all of these processes is seen in declining rates of 

creation and destruction of both firms and jobs. 

Start-ups:  Start-ups are a key driver of productivity growth.  Although it may feel 

that we are living in an age of disruption, the birthrate of startups has actually been in 

decline since the 1970s.9  New firms can be loosely grouped into two categories:  those

started by “lifestyle entrepreneurs” who want to be their own boss, but who have little 

prospect or desire for high growth; and those founded by transformational entrepreneurs 

who start businesses that aspire to grow dramatically and change their industry.  Before 

2000, the decline in new firm entry was mainly in the first sort; since 2000, it is also 

found among the so-called transformational firms.  While the drop in the formation of 

lifestyle-type firms could be neutral or even a positive for productivity, as in the case of 

the U.S. retail sector, the reduction in the creation of high-performance new firms 

suggests that lower dynamism could be associated with slower productivity growth.10 

Labor Market Dynamism:  While changing jobs can be painful, job changes in the 

aggregate are associated with higher compensation, implying higher productivity.  But 

the rewards to job change may have declined.  Fewer start-ups has meant lower “job 

flows,” as measured by job creation and destruction, and fewer opportunities for workers 

to find better jobs.  And labor market dynamism across many dimensions has declined by 

more than can be explained by the reduction in startups.  Workers have become less 

likely to leave their jobs, change jobs, or move geographically to take new jobs.11

 Dynamism is a relatively new field of inquiry, and there is no consensus yet on 

the reasons for, or implications of, these developments.  Some plausible sources of these 

changes are benign, while others are more negative and suggest that the reduction in 

dynamism may be a factor behind the slower increases in productivity.  For example, 

historically there has been a robust correlation at the firm level between productivity and 

growth, with high productivity levels being correlated with faster growth and low 

productivity levels being associated with contraction or exit.  This relationship has 

weakened since 2000, particularly in the high-tech sector.12  High productivity firms are 

not growing as quickly, and low productivity firms are shrinking or exiting at a slower 

pace.  

 It may be that some government policies, while well intended, have contributed to 

these trends.  One example that may explain a small portion of the reduction in dynamism 

is the substantial increase in occupational licensing.13  By some estimates, the fraction of 

workers who are required to hold a government issued license or certification to perform 

their jobs has risen from 5 percent in the 1950s to close to 40 percent.14  Like many 

policies, licensing has benefits and costs.  Among the costs are that it tends to reduce job 

switching and employment opportunities for excluded workers, and may restrict 

competition and thus increase prices faced by consumers.  Among the benefits may be 

higher quality products and services and improved health and safety standards.  Some 

researchers have advanced the view that licensing requirements have become overly 

                                                   
12 See Decker and others, “Declining Business Dynamism,” in note 5. 
13 Licensing restrictions increase the costs of switching occupations and potentially reduces interstate 
mobility. The evidence linking licensing to labor market fluidity is inconclusive, with some researchers 
finding a linkage and others not.

burdensome and may have contributed to the secular decline in job and worker 

reallocation.15     

 Dynamism is a fast-developing field of research, and it will be important that 

public policy react appropriately as this work continues.  It goes without saying that 

economic policymakers should use all available information and tools to create a 

supportive environment for growth.  We need policies that support labor force 

participation and the development of skills, business hiring and investment, and 

productivity growth.  For the most part, these policies are outside the remit of the Federal 

Reserve, but monetary policy can contribute by supporting a strong and durable 

expansion, in a context of price stability.  

Conclusion 

How should we think about the performance of our economy since the Crisis?  

The picture is mixed, and that question will no doubt be debated in the decades ahead.  

But here are some facts.  Since 2011, job growth has been stronger and unemployment 

has declined faster than most forecasts.  On the other hand, economic growth has been 

consistently lower than almost all private- and public-sector forecasts, including those of 

FOMC participants.  Growth has been slower in this recovery than in many previous 

recoveries; a growing body of research shows that weak recoveries are the norm after 

deep recessions and those associated with severe financial crises.  Finally, our recovery 

has also been stronger than those of many other advanced economies following this 

crisis.

I expect our economy to continue to make progress.  Monetary policy will need to 

remain supportive of growth, as we work through the challenging global environment.  

As always, it will be important to carefully monitor economic developments in order to 

assess the stance of policy appropriate to foster continued progress toward our objectives 

of maximum employment and price stability.
