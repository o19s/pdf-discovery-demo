Let me begin by thanking the organizers for inviting me to participate in this 

important dialogue on the role of finance in society.  The financial sector is vital to the 

economy.  A well-functioning financial sector promotes job creation, innovation, and 

inclusive economic growth.  But when the incentives facing financial firms are distorted, 

these firms may act in ways that can harm society.  Appropriate regulation, coupled with 

vigilant supervision, is essential to address these issues.    

Unfortunately, in the years preceding the financial crisis, all too many firms took 

on risks they could neither measure nor manage.  Leverage, interconnectedness, and 

maturity and liquidity transformation escalated to dangerous levels across the financial 

system.  The result was the most severe financial crisis and economic downturn since the 

Great Depression.  Almost 9 million Americans lost their jobs, roughly twice as many 

lost their homes, and all too many households ended up underwater on their mortgages 

and overburdened with debt.  To be sure, some individuals and families borrowed 

unwisely, but too often financial institutions encouraged the behavior that resulted in 

such excessive debt.   

In my remarks today I will discuss some important reasons why the incentives 

facing financial institutions were distorted and the steps that regulators are taking to 

realign those incentives.    

The Important Role of the Financial Sector 

Before discussing the incentives that contributed to the buildup of risk at financial 

institutions, I would like to highlight the important contributions that the financial sector 

makes to the economy and society.  First and foremost, financial institutions channel 

society’s scarce savings to productive investments, thereby promoting business formation

and job creation.  Access to capital is important for all firms, but it is particularly vital for 

startups and young firms, which often lack a sufficient stream of earnings to increase 

employment and internally finance capital spending.  Indeed, research shows that more 

highly developed financial systems disproportionately benefit entrepreneurship.1  

The financial sector also helps households save for retirement, purchase homes 

and cars, and weather unexpected developments.  Many financial innovations, such as the 

increased availability of low-cost mutual funds, have improved opportunities for 

households to participate in asset markets and diversify their holdings.2  Expanded credit 

access has helped households maintain living standards when suffering job loss, illness, 

or other unexpected contingencies.3  Technological innovations have increased the ease 

and convenience with which individuals make and receive payments.4  

The contribution of the financial sector to household risk management and 

business investment, as well as the significant contribution of financial-sector 

development to economic growth, has been documented in many studies.5  Such research 

1 Recent reviews have highlighted potential costs of a distorted financial sector, but such reviews also 
emphasize the range of both theoretical and empirical work that has documented the many ways in which 
the financial sector can support economic efficiency; see, for example, Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) 
and Zingales (2015).  Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) discuss evidence that financial development 
supports entrepreneurship, and Fort and others (2013) examine the importance of financing for business 
formation and young firms. 
2 Greenwood and Scharfstein (2013) discuss how an important fraction of growth in the U.S. financial 
sector reflects the greater demand of households for asset management services and credit.  Malkiel (2013) 
considers similar issues and reviews how improved access to low-cost investment options has benefited 
households. 
3  Krueger and Perri (2006) analyze how an increase in access to credit contributed to households’ ability to 
smooth spending despite substantial income volatility. 
4 Changes in payment technologies have been rapid, and an area of particular interest is the fast growth of 
mobile payment and financial service technologies.  The Federal Reserve has conducted several surveys to 
understand these developments, and the most recent results are discussed in Board of Governors (2015).  
5 A substantial body of research finds that financial development supports economic growth, including 
Goldsmith (1969), King and Levine (1993), Rajan and Zingales (1998), and Levine (2005).  It is 
noteworthy that this research emphasizes differences across countries, and that the United States is among 
the most financially developed countries in the world.

shows that, across countries and over time, financial development, up to a point, has 

disproportionately benefited the poor and served to alleviate economic inequality.6  

Distorted Incentives in the Financial Sector  

Despite these benefits, as we have seen, actions by financial institutions have the 

potential to inflict harm on society.  Instead of promoting financial security through 

prudent mortgage underwriting, the financial sector prior to the crisis facilitated a bubble 

in the housing market and too often encouraged households to take on mortgages they 

neither understood nor could afford.  Recent research has raised important questions 

about the benefits and costs of the rapid growth of the financial services industry in the 

United States over the past 40 years.7 

A combination of responses to distorted incentives by players throughout the 

financial system created an environment conducive to a crisis.  Excessive leverage placed 

institutions at great risk of insolvency in the event that severe, albeit low-probability, 

problems materialized.  Overreliance on fragile short-term funding by many institutions 

left the system vulnerable to runs.  And excessive risk-taking increased the probability 

that severe problems would, in fact, materialize.  Moreover, regulators--and the structure 

of the regulatory system itself--did not keep up with changes in the financial sector and 

were insufficiently attuned to systemic risks.  Once concerns began to develop about 

escalating losses at large firms, insufficient liquidity and capital interacted in an adverse 

6 Beck, Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2007) show that financial development reduces poverty and inequality 
in a study examining evidence across countries. 
7Zingales (2015) raises a number of questions regarding ways in which distortions in the financial sector 
may contribute to “rent seeking” activity that may promote inefficiency.  Philippon and Reshef (2012) 
examine trends in compensation in the financial sector and the contribution of such trends to the increase in 
income inequality in the United States in recent decades.  Philippon and Reshef (2013) and Cecchetti and 
Kharroubi (2012) revisit the links between financial development and economic growth, focusing 
particularly on these relationships around periods of rapid growth in the financial sector or among 
economies with a large financial sector.

feedback loop.  Funding pressures contributed to “fire sales” of financial assets and 

losses, reducing capital levels and heightening liquidity pressures--culminating in the 

near collapse of the financial system in late 2008. 

Capital and liquidity 

Several factors encouraged excessive leverage, including market perceptions that 

some institutions were “too big to fail.”8  Financial institutions also had an incentive to 

engage in regulatory arbitrage, moving assets to undercapitalized off-balance-sheet 

vehicles.  The complexity of the largest banking organizations also may have impeded 

market discipline.  In addition, financial intermediation outside of the traditional banking 

sector grew rapidly in the years up to 2007, leaving gaps in the regulatory umbrella.  And 

conflicts in the incentives facing managers, shareholders, and creditors may have induced 

banks to increase leverage.9   

To strengthen banks’ resilience, the Federal Reserve and the other banking 

agencies have substantially increased capital requirements.  Regulatory minimums for 

capital relative to risk-weighted assets are significantly higher, and capital requirements 

now focus on the highest-quality capital, such as common equity.  In addition to risk-

based standards, bank holding companies and depositories face a leverage ratio 

requirement.  Also, significantly higher capital standards--both risk-weighted and 

leverage ratios--are being applied to the most systemically important banking 

organizations.  Such surcharges are appropriate because of the substantial harm that the 

8 For a review of many factors that may have contributed to leverage in the financial sector and a discussion 
of how, in some cases, these factors reflect distortions that imply leverage was excessive, see Admati and 
others (2013a). 
9 The notion that “agency problems”--that is, conflicts in the interests of managers and various stakeholders 
in firms--may contribute to excessive debt has a long history, most notably following the notion of “debt 
overhangs” from Myers (1977).  Hanson, Kashyap, and Stein (2011) emphasize the potential importance of 
this issue for the financial sector.  Admati and others (2013b) present a related mechanism.

failure of a systemic institution would inflict on the financial system and the economy.  

Higher capital standards provide large, complex institutions with an incentive to reduce 

their systemic footprint.  We are also employing annual stress tests to gauge large 

institutions’ ability to weather a very severe downturn and distress of counterparties and, 

importantly, continue lending to households and businesses.  Firms that do not meet these 

standards face restrictions on dividends and share buybacks.  As a result of these changes, 

for the largest banks, Tier 1 common equity--the highest-quality form of capital--has 

more than doubled since the financial crisis.   

New liquidity regulations will also improve incentives in the financial system.  

Prior to the crisis, institutions’ incentives to rely on short-term borrowing to fund 

investments in riskier or less liquid instruments were distorted in two important ways.  

First, many investors were willing to accept a very low interest rate on short-term 

liabilities of financial institutions or on securitizations without demanding adequate 

compensation for severe-but-unlikely risks, such as a temporary loss of market liquidity.  

Perhaps these firms expected government support or simply considered illiquidity a very 

remote possibility.  Second, institutions’ attempts to shift their holdings once concerns 

about credit or liquidity risk arose created a fire-sale dynamic that amplified declines in 

market values, causing unanticipated spillovers onto other institutions and across 

markets.10   

Recently implemented regulations aim to strengthen liquidity.  For example, a 

new liquidity coverage ratio requires internationally active banking organizations to hold 

10 The notion that securities issued by financial institutions may provide liquidity services in a manner that 
potentially contributes to fragility because such securities do not have the safety and liquidity of publicly 
issued securities is examined in, for example, Gorton, Lewellen, and Metrick (2012); Stein (2012); and 
Gorton and Ordoñez (2014).

sufficient high-quality liquid assets to meet their projected net cash outflows during a 30-

day stress period.  A new process--the Comprehensive Liquidity Analysis and Review--

sets supervisory expectations for liquidity-risk management and evaluates institutions’ 

practices against these benchmarks.  A proposal for a net stable funding ratio would 

require better liquidity management at horizons beyond that covered by the liquidity 

coverage ratio.  A proposed capital surcharge for the largest firms would discourage 

overreliance on short-term wholesale funding.  Also, the Securities and Exchange 

Commission has adopted changes in regulations that may help avoid future runs on prime 

money market mutual funds (that is, money funds that invest primarily in corporate debt 

securities).  And reforms in the triparty repo market have reduced risks associated with 

intraday exposures.   

Large, complex institutions and too big to fail 

In the aftermath of the crisis, the Congress tasked the banking regulators with 

challenging and changing the perception that any financial institution is too big to fail by 

ensuring that even very large banking organizations can be resolved without harming 

financial stability.  Steps are under way to achieve this objective.  In particular, banking 

organizations are required to prepare “living wills”--plans for their rapid and orderly 

resolution in the event of insolvency.  Regulators are considering requiring that bank 

holding companies have sufficient total loss-absorbing capacity, including long-term 

debt, to enable them to be wound down without government support.11  In addition, the 

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has designed a strategy that it could deploy 

11 For a discussion of total loss-absorbing capacity, see Financial Stability Board (2014), a consultative 
document on a proposal for a common international standard on total loss-absorbing capacity for global 
systemic banks.  The comment period on this FSB proposal ended in February of this year.

(known as Single Point of Entry) to resolve a systemically important institution in an 

orderly manner.   

The crisis also revealed that risk management at large, complex financial 

institutions was insufficient to handle the risks that some firms had taken.  Compensation 

systems all too frequently failed to appropriately account for longer-term risks 

undertaken by employees.  And lax controls in some cases contributed to unethical and 

illegal behavior by banking organizations and their employees.  The Federal Reserve has 

made improving risk management and internal controls a top priority.  For example, the 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, which includes the stress tests that I 

mentioned, also involves an evaluation to ensure firms have a sound process in place for 

measuring and monitoring the risks they are taking and for matching their capital levels 

to those risks.  Also, supervisors from the Fed and other agencies have pressed firms to 

improve their internal controls and to make their boards of directors more directly 

responsible for compensation decisions and employee conduct. 

Changes to Regulatory and Supervisory Focus 

As I noted, the financial crisis revealed weaknesses in our nation’s system for 

supervising and regulating the financial industry.  Prior to the crisis, regulatory agencies, 

including the Federal Reserve, focused on the safety and soundness of individual firms--

as required by their legislative mandate at the time--rather than the stability of the 

financial system as a whole.  Our regulatory system did not provide any supervisory 

watchdog with responsibility for identifying and addressing risks associated with 

activities and institutions that were outside the regulatory perimeter.  The rapid growth of 

the “shadow” nonbank financial sector left significant gaps in regulation. 


 - 8 - 

In response, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 

2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) expanded the mandate and authority of the Federal Reserve to 

allow it to consider risks to financial stability in supervising financial firms under its 

charge.  Within the Federal Reserve System, we have reorganized our supervision of the 

most systemically important institutions to emphasize what we call a “horizontal 

perspective,” which examines institutions as a group and in comparative terms, focusing 

on their interaction with the broader financial system.  We also created a new office 

within the Fed to identify emerging risks to stability in the broader financial system--both 

the bank and nonbank financial sectors--and to develop policies to mitigate systemic risk.  

The Dodd-Frank Act created the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council, 

chaired by the Treasury Secretary, and the Federal Reserve is a member.  It is charged 

with identifying systemically important financial institutions and systemically risky 

activities that are not subject to consolidated supervision and designating those 

institutions and activities for appropriate supervision.  And it is charged with encouraging 

greater information sharing and policy coordination across financial regulatory agencies. 

Where We Stand 

My topic is broad, and my time is short.  Let me end with three thoughts.  First, I 

believe that we and other supervisory agencies have made significant progress in 

addressing incentive problems within the financial sector, especially within the banking 

sector.  Second, policymakers, including those of us at the Federal Reserve, remain 

watchful for areas in need of further action or in which the steps taken to date need to be 

adjusted.  And, third, engagement with the broader public is crucial to ensuring that any 

future steps move our financial system closer to where it should be.  Active debate and

discussion of these issues at this conference and in other forums is important to improve 

our understanding of the challenges that remain.
