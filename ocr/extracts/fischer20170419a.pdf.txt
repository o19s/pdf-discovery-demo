I appreciate your invitation to participate in this afternoon’s panel discussion.  In 

my remarks, I will discuss how U.S. monetary policy actions affect our foreign trading 

partners, with particular focus on how foreign economies have responded to the Federal 

Open Market Committee’s (FOMC) ongoing normalization of policy rates.1   

Spillovers from the Fed’s Unconventional Policies 

Extensive empirical research on spillovers--including by Federal Reserve and 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff members--indicates that spillovers from the 

actions of major central banks occur through several important channels.2  While the 

exchange rate is a key channel of transmission and gets a great deal of attention in the 

public debate about monetary spillovers, it is not the only channel.  U.S. monetary policy 

also affects foreign economies by influencing U.S. domestic demand and by affecting 

global financial conditions.    

My reading of the evidence is that the Fed’s highly accommodative monetary 

policy during the Global Financial Crisis and its aftermath probably raised foreign gross 

domestic product (GDP) overall.3  While U.S. monetary easing caused the dollar to 

depreciate, which reduced foreign GDP by shifting demand toward cheaper U.S. goods, 

foreign economies benefited from a stronger expansion in U.S. domestic 

demand.  Moreover, U.S. monetary easing also stimulated foreign GDP by depressing 

foreign bond yields and raising the prices of risky assets.   

                                                 
1 The views expressed are mine and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open 
Market Committee.  I am grateful to Chris Erceg for his assistance. 
2 There is a large empirical literature assessing the spillovers from Federal Reserve policy actions, 
including those from unconventional policies such as large-scale asset purchases--for example, Fratzscher, 
Lo Duca, and Straub (2013); Rogers, Scotti, and Wright (2014); Neely (2015); and Sahay and others 
(2014).     
3 My November 11, 2016, speech (Fischer, 2016) provides a more detailed discussion of spillovers from 
U.S. monetary policy, including some quantitative estimates that draw on the analysis of Ammer and others 
(2016).

Of course, there were considerable differences in how foreign economies were 

affected by the Fed’s policies.  Because the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) also 

experienced slow growth after the financial crisis, their central banks adopted similar 

policies.  By contrast, the Fed’s accommodative policies put further upward pressure on 

asset prices and currencies in some emerging market economies (EMEs) that were 

already experiencing rapid output growth.  Thus, EME central banks had to navigate 

between tightening policy more--and hurting exports through a bigger exchange rate 

appreciation--and maintaining an accommodative stance closer to the Fed’s, but with a 

higher risk of overheating.4  These tradeoffs faced by EME central banks underscore 

some of the challenges posed by monetary policy divergence with the United States--a 

tradeoff with which I am personally very familiar.   

Spillovers from Recent Policy Tightening 

Monetary policy divergence remains a familiar theme today, but the focus has 

obviously shifted to the consequences of tighter U.S. monetary policy for the global 

economy.  Policy divergence is an ongoing concern given that most AFEs and many 

EMEs have continued to pursue highly accommodative monetary policies that remain 

appropriate in light of their weaker cyclical positions and subdued levels of underlying 

inflation.  Many observers point to the “taper tantrum” in 2013 as illustrating how 

monetary tightening by the Federal Reserve can potentially have strong contractionary 

effects on foreign financial conditions.  Subsequently, the expectation that a steadily 

improving U.S. labor market would call for tighter U.S. monetary policy--and hence 

imply greater monetary divergence with our trading partners--helped drive a sharp

appreciation of the dollar between the middle of 2014 and the end of last year that was 

accompanied by capital outflows from many EMEs.  

Against this backdrop and the concerns it raises, the reaction in financial markets 

to the FOMC’s decisions to increase the target range for the federal funds rate following 

its December 2016 and March 2017 meetings--by a cumulative total of 50 basis 

points--seems benign.  The yields on risky foreign bonds, especially in EMEs, have 

continued to decline to below historical norms, and global stock prices have risen.  The 

dollar has depreciated since mid-December, especially against EMEs, and the EMEs have 

experienced capital inflows. 

In my view, this favorable reaction partly reflects a view by market participants 

that the rate hikes are a signal of the FOMC’s confidence in the underlying prospects for 

the U.S. economy that in turn has increased confidence in the global outlook:  A strong 

U.S. economy is a major plus for the global economy.  But the main reason for the 

positive market reaction is that foreign output expansions appear more entrenched, and 

downside risks to those economies noticeably smaller than in recent years.  In Europe, 

unemployment has fallen steadily; inflation and inflation expectations are moving toward 

central bank targets; and, while Brexit entails many unknowns, so far it has not resulted 

in significant financial market disruptions.  China’s economy also appears to be on a 

more solid footing, which has helped stabilize the renminbi as well as support growth in 

other EMEs.    

The IMF staff has taken these developments into account in the April 2017 World 

Economic Outlook (WEO) and forecasts that world GDP growth will be noticeably 

higher over the next two years than in 2016--a slight upward revision relative to the

October 2016 WEO.5  There may well even be some chance that foreign economies kick 

into gear enough that U.S. and foreign business conditions become reasonably well 

aligned, as occurred during the U.S. monetary tightening cycles that began in 1999 and in 

2004.  In both of those episodes, U.S. exports grew substantially against the backdrop of 

a brisk expansion in foreign activity and a stable or even slightly depreciating dollar.   

Of course, it is hard to predict whether foreign economies continue to strengthen 

so that the global economy will move more in sync--as I hope--or if a substantial gap will 

remain between the business cycle positions of the United States and our foreign trading 

partners.  However, even if monetary policy divergence remains substantial, there is good 

reason to think that spillovers to foreign economies will be manageable.  First, I expect 

that the Fed’s removal of accommodation will be driven by a continued expansion of the 

U.S. economy; thus, foreign economies are likely to benefit from the developments that 

induce the FOMC to tighten.  Second, most foreign central banks should be able to 

mitigate an undesirable tightening of their own financial conditions through appropriate 

policy actions.  An important lesson of the taper tantrum was that effective 

communication and actions by major central banks, including the European Central Bank 

and the Bank of England, were helpful in quickly pushing bond yields down to levels that 

these central banks regarded as appropriate to their economic situation.  Third, many 

EMEs have markedly improved fundamentals--including smaller current account deficits 

and more anchored inflation expectations--that should allow them to better withstand the 

effects of U.S. tightening, though some vulnerabilities remain.

Finally, I expect that U.S. policy normalization will be gradual under likely 

scenarios for the evolution of output and inflation.  A gradual and ongoing removal of 

accommodation seems likely both to maximize the prospects of a continued expansion in 

the U.S. economy and to mitigate the risk of undesirable spillovers abroad.
