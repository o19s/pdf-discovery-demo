November 12, 2010 





 Good afternoon.  I would like to thank the National Consumer Law Center 

(NCLC) for inviting me to speak here at the Consumer Rights Litigation Conference.  

I’m particularly pleased to share my thoughts with you in my first public speech since 

joining the Federal Reserve Board of Governors last month.   

 These are challenging times for policymakers because they are profoundly 

challenging times for millions of Americans.  Many families have suffered significant 

declines in their net worth over the past several years, especially as the value of their 

homes and other assets has plummeted.  Many households have faced job losses or large 

reductions in the number of hours worked, events that have reduced family income and 

well-being.  Retirees are feeling heightened anxiety as companies and local and state 

governments debate measures to restrict retiree pensions.  The ability of households to 

borrow has also shrunk as underwriting standards have tightened, placing more weight on 

existing debt obligations of consumers.  For households trying to navigate these 

difficulties, the work that many of you do to directly help consumers deal with the legal 

dimensions of their financial lives is of great importance.  I commend you for your 

ongoing and persistent contributions to stabilizing family and community life in our 

country. 

 One aspect of the financial crisis that touches directly on your work is foreclosure.  

As you well know--and in fact you were among the first to predict the problem--millions 

of homeowners have gone through foreclosure in recent years; many more will go 

through it in the near future; and countless others are struggling to keep their payments 

current even as the housing market and the overall economy make it hard to do so.

The number of foreclosures initiated on residential properties has soared from 

about one million in 2006, the year that house prices peaked, to 2.8 million last year. 

There were 1.2 million foreclosure filings in just the first half of this year.  In addition, 

right now nearly five million loans are somewhere in the foreclosure process, or are 90 

days or more past due and hence at serious risk for a foreclosure filing.   

Our projections remain very grim for the foreseeable future:  All told, we expect 

about two and one-quarter million foreclosure filings this year and again next year, and 

about two million more in 2012.  While these numbers are down from their peak in 2009, 

they remain extremely high by historical standards and represent a trauma in the lives of 

millions of people affected. 

 The most recent alarming development in the foreclosure process that has caught 

public attention involves improper activities by mortgage servicers.  But let’s remember 

that, for years, housing counselors and advocates nationwide have documented patterns 

of fraudulent and abusive mortgage servicing practices.  Current attention is focused on 

so-called “robo-signers,” individuals who appear to have attested to the validity of 

documents in a number of foreclosure filings so large as to suggest that something may 

be amiss in the recording process.  This development is troubling on its own, but it also 

shines a harsh spotlight on other longstanding procedural flaws in mortgage servicing.   

 Many may view these procedural flaws as trivial, technical, or inconsequential, 

but I consider them to be part of a deeper, systemic problem and am gravely concerned. 

During my time as Commissioner of Financial Regulation for the State of Maryland, I 

encountered a Pandora’s Box of predatory tactics that included: 


 - 3 -

 the padding of fees, such as late fees, broker-price opinions, inspection fees, 

attorney’s fees, and other fees;   

 the strategic misapplication of payments so that the homeowner’s payments for 

principal and interest due on the loan were improperly applied to the servicer’s 

fees, sometimes improperly causing the loan to be considered to be in default;  

and  

 the inappropriate assessment of force-placed  insurance, with premiums of two to 

four times the cost of standard homeowners’ insurance, which in turn caused 

servicers to collect these premiums before applying the payments to principal and 

interest, precipitating foreclosure.   

Theoretically, it is possible that the robo-signer controversy may turn out to be a short-

term technical problem that can be addressed through additional verifications and, when 

necessary, re-processing of critical documents.  Nevertheless, I believe that serious and 

sustained reform is needed to address the larger problems in mortgage servicing.   

 The mortgage servicing industry as we know it is a relatively recent invention, 

and, undoubtedly, it has never before been tested in a national housing crisis of this 

magnitude.  As the continuing surge in foreclosures suggests, mortgage servicers simply 

are not doing enough to provide sustainable alternatives to foreclosure.  This may be due 

to the fact that the vast bulk of loan servicing today is done by large servicers, which are 

either subsidiaries of depository institutions, affiliates of depository institutions, or 

independent companies focused primarily or exclusively on loan servicing.  

Before securitization became commonplace, it was much more likely for a 

mortgage to be serviced by the same entity that had originated the loan.  This simple 


 - 4 -

approach ensured that lenders knew immediately if a homeowner was having payment 

problems, and could take action to mitigate possible losses.  A fair bit of this kind of 

“portfolio servicing” still takes place, but as the residential real estate market shifted from 

an originate-to-hold model to an originate-to-distribute model, an industry of independent 

third-party entities emerged to service the loans on behalf of the securitization trusts.  

These trusts, as a requirement for their tax-preferred status, were supposed to be passive, 

with the management of individual loans left to the servicer.  These servicing 

arrangements are now commonplace in the industry:  In fact, the system has matured 

rapidly and experienced considerable consolidation over the past twenty years. 

 The benefits to consolidation include significant economies of scale in the 

collection and disbursal of routine payments.  But the kind of time-consuming, involved 

work that is now needed in the loss mitigation area was not contemplated at anything like 

this kind of scale, and the payment structures between the servicers and investors may not 

always be sufficient to support large-scale loan workout activity.  Unfortunately, as we 

are seeing now, there are also dramatically significant drawbacks to this model.  Third-

party servicers earn money through annual servicing fees, a myriad of other fees, and on 

float interest, and they maximize profits by keeping their costs down, streamlining 

processes wherever possible, and by buying servicing rights on pools of loans that they 

hope will require little hands-on work.  Again, for routine payment processing this all 

leads to economies of scale, and the industry has consolidated significantly in recent 

years as a result.   

But the services needed in the current housing crisis are not one-size-fits-all.  

Loan servicers likely never anticipated the drastic need for the kind of time-consuming, 


 - 5 -

detailed work that is now required in the loss mitigation area, and the payment structures 

between the servicers and investors are not sufficient to support large-scale loan workout 

activity.  As it turns out, the structural incentives that influence servicer actions, 

especially when they are servicing loans for a third party, now run counter to the interests 

of homeowners and investors.   

 While an investor’s financial interests are tied more or less directly to the 

performance of a loan, the interests of a third-party servicer are tied to it only indirectly, 

at best.  The servicer makes money, to oversimplify a bit, by maximizing fees earned and 

minimizing expenses while performing the actions spelled out in its contract with the 

investor.   

In the case, for instance, of a homeowner struggling to make payments, a 

foreclosure almost always costs the investor money, but may actually earn money for the 

servicer in the form of fees.  Proactive measures to avoid foreclosure and minimize cost 

to the investor, on the other hand, may be good for the homeowner, but involve costs that 

could very well lead to a net loss to the servicer.  In the case of a temporary forbearance 

for a homeowner, for example, the investor and homeowner both could win--if the 

forbearance allows the homeowner to get back on their feet and avoid foreclosure--but 

the servicer could well lose money.  In the case of a permanent modification, the investor 

and homeowner could both be considerably better off relative to foreclosure, but the 

servicer could again lose money.  

 Why might a servicer lose money in an instance that could be win-win for the 

borrower and investor?  It’s because of the amount of work needed, the structure for 

reimbursing costs to the servicer, and other costs incurred by the servicer on delinquent, 


 - 6 -

but not yet foreclosed upon, borrowers.  Loss mitigation options, such as forbearance and 

loan modification, require individualized case work.  Thus, the servicer needs to invest in 

additional resources, including trained personnel who can deal with often complex one-

off transactions.  In the case of a private-label security, many of the costs of this work 

may not be reimbursed by the trust.  Other costs result from even temporary forbearance, 

such as the servicer’s requirement, in most cases, to advance principal and interest to the 

investor every month, even though it has not received payment from the borrower.  Even 

in the case of a servicer who has every best intention of doing “the right thing,” the 

bottom-line incentives are largely misaligned with everyone else involved in the 

transaction, and most certainly the homeowners themselves. 

   We don’t know yet what the end results will be for homeowners.  But the best 

third-party servicers would have to be diligent and willing to absorb relative losses when 

the standard business model for the industry would seem to put a thumb on the scale in 

favor of foreclosure.  The most urgent needs of the servicing world today require a 

sufficient number of personnel with the adequate mix of training, tools, and judgment to 

deal with problem loans on a large scale--in other words, activities with few economies 

of scale.  The skill set of personnel hired and trained for routine work--efficiency and 

accuracy in following rules, and little discretion in decisionmaking--is likely a poor 

match for loss mitigation activities that require constant creativity and case-by-case 

judgment.  Therefore, simply transferring work from one part of a company to another 

does not achieve much without significant investments in training and retraining.  

Servicers have been publicly pledging for several years to increase their servicing 

capacity, and many have.  Unfortunately, there is plenty of evidence to suggest that many 


 - 7 -

servicers’ workforces lack the knowledge and capacity to deal with the immensity of the 

mortgage crisis. 

 In order to do their jobs well servicers need strong internal procedures and 

controls.  Recent events suggest that servicers may be lacking in this regard, to the 

detriment of consumers, and, quite possibly, to the detriment of the investors to whom 

they are contractually obligated to maximize revenue.  I recognize that many servicers 

have stepped up and diligently tried to improve their work; I applaud and encourage 

them.  However, lingering problems remain and I suspect that these may be due to 

deferred maintenance and investment on a significant scale.  In boom times, servicers had 

the luxury of building out relatively lean systems that efficiently processed the more 

routine aspects of the business, but they do not appear to have planned for the 

infrastructure that would be needed during a serious down cycle.  As you know, 

consumers hold the losing end of this stick.   

  More seriously, recurring issues that have dogged some elements of the 

servicing industry go beyond misaligned incentives to simple bad business practices.  

One recurring problem that has triggered litigation involves the servicer’s handling of 

fees.  When a servicer does not properly carry out its primary duty of collecting and 

appropriately allocating mortgage payments, it can cost homeowners money and, in the 

most extreme cases, cause a homeowner to be pushed into premature default.  Some 

servicers obtain unwarranted or unauthorized fees from borrowers after engaging in 

unfair collection practices, or through other conduct that causes borrower default, such as 

misapplied payments, padded costs, erroneous charges, late fees, and so on.    


 - 8 -

 Too many accounts of shoddy operating procedures--lost paperwork, slow 

response times, and sloppy recordkeeping--cast a dark shadow on this part of the industry 

that links mortgage borrowers and lenders.  The broad grant of delegated authority that 

servicers enjoy under pooling and servicing agreements (PSAs), combined with an 

effective lack of choice on the part of consumers, creates an environment ripe for abuse.  

Moreover, the inability of some servicers to maintain complete and accurate records, and 

to transfer servicing rights cleanly, causes additional uncertainties and vulnerabilities.  

 The impact of poor business practices can linger on even after the foreclosure 

sale.  In managing foreclosed properties in lenders’ inventories, servicers may be 

motivated by timeliness measures in PSAs to induce the former homeowner or bona fide 

tenant to vacate before they are legally required to do so, sometimes under the threat of 

eviction.  Once the properties are vacant, servicers exercise great discretion in deciding 

whether or not to repair foreclosed property based on the likelihood that the servicer’s 

advances are recoverable from the sale proceeds.  With real estate owned (REO) 

inventories projected to reach one million by the end of 2010, servicer actions will 

heavily influence the effectiveness of neighborhood stabilization efforts at a time of 

persistent decline in home values and in fragile markets already weakened by a glut of 

vacant and abandoned properties, particularly in low-wealth communities. 

 Finally, we face a cluster of problems surrounding loan modification.  Servicers’ 

significant concerns about the U.S. Treasury’s Home Affordable Modification Program 

(HAMP) are well-known.  That said, we do not know enough about how well servicers 

are complying with the requirements of that program, or whether all of the HAMP 

modifications that should be made are indeed being made.  Many servicers, in fact, 


 - 9 -

currently report that the bulk of their loan modifications are being done outside of 

HAMP.  Again, we do not know enough about what those modifications look like or how 

they are being structured.   

 Prior to HAMP, many servicers were creating modifications that themselves were 

problematic.  For example, high percentages of the pre-HAMP modifications provided no 

payment relief to borrowers and, not surprisingly, then exhibited high re-default rates.  

Servicers may not be doing everything they can do to ensure that loss mitigation 

activities, including HAMP and non-HAMP modifications, are responsible and 

sustainable and subject to strong internal controls.  

  So the problems that have been grabbing headlines in recent weeks are neither 

new nor amenable to quick fixes.  While there may be some specific practices--“robo-

signing” among them--that are possible to isolate and eliminate, chronic, uncured 

problems continue to plague this industry.  There is a long track record of actions and 

cases brought by attorneys general, which some of you in this room have no doubt 

litigated, demonstrating the harm done to consumers by sloppy or unscrupulous practices. 

Because consumers cannot choose to hire or fire their servicers (other than by paying off 

the loan), the industry lacks the level of market discipline imposed in other industries by 

the working of consumer choice.  For this reason, if servicers do not actively maintain 

adequate and trained staff and do not establish and heed internal controls, if investors do 

not monitor their servicers’ behavior, if regulators do not conduct meaningful 

examinations, if courts do not stand guard against unfair practices, both substantive and 

procedural, then it will be much less likely that a well-functioning housing market will 

reemerge from this crisis.  Because the very structure of the loan servicing industry as it 


 - 10 -

currently operates inevitably leads to misaligned incentives and a propensity to defer 

costly investments, a more significant re-thinking of the basic business model must also 

be undertaken if we are to avoid repeating prior mistakes. 

 I realize that I’m painting a rather gloomy picture.  But be assured that I do 

believe that we can make real progress on the ground through coordinated public and 

private action.  Let me conclude by talking a little bit about what the Federal Reserve and 

others are doing to address these issues.   

Although foreclosure practices have traditionally been--and rightfully should 

remain--a domain of the states, the Federal Reserve has been expanding its expertise in 

working with the industry--first, in a review of non-bank subsidiaries in conjunction with 

other state and federal regulators, and, currently, with a review of loan modification 

practices by certain servicers.  As the current servicing issues began to emerge more 

clearly, the Federal Reserve and other federal banking agencies initiated an in-depth 

review of practices at the largest mortgage servicing operations.  The review focuses on 

foreclosure practices generally, but with a concentration on the breakdowns that seem to 

have led to inaccurate affidavits and other questionable legal documents being used in the 

foreclosure process.  When the interagency review is completed, we will have more 

information about the extent and significance of these very troubling practices, as well as 

an understanding of what must be done to prevent them in the future.  We have also 

solicited information and input from other knowledgeable sources, including NCLC, to 

help us better direct our actions to detect possible systematic problems at specific 

servicers or within the industry at large. 


 - 11 -

 Preliminarily, we have directed certain firms to complete thorough self-

assessments of the policies and procedures they use for determining whether to foreclose 

on a residential mortgage loan, and, in those cases where foreclosure is authorized, an 

examination of the processes they used to comply with relevant federal and state laws.  

We have directed these firms not just to address their stated policies and procedures, but 

to assess how they actually work in practice.  At the same time, examiners from the 

banking agencies will be on-site to review individual loan files, evaluate controls over the 

selection and management of third-party service providers, and carefully test the 

assertions that the institutions make in their self-assessments.  Institutions will be directed 

to correct any deficiencies that they discover in their self-assessments or that come to 

light in the on-site examination process. 

 As a general matter, the Federal Reserve reviews the compliance procedures of 

the banking organizations that we supervise as part of the examination process.  

However, federal examiners typically are not experts in the application of each state’s 

laws, especially in an area as complex as mortgage foreclosure procedures.  So, federal 

examiners need to coordinate with their state examiner counterparts who should have a 

stronger understanding of their state foreclosure laws.  For federally chartered 

institutions, the Federal Reserve requires that the banks we supervise have adequate 

compliance risk management programs that are being followed.   

 Given the potential ramifications for consumers, the housing market, and the 

economy as a whole, I believe it’s fair to say that every relevant arm of the federal 

government is taking the underlying dynamics of the mortgage foreclosure crisis very 

seriously.  I also hold out hope that the multi-state work engaged in by the 50 state 


 - 12 -

attorneys general will prove to be a vehicle for resolving the underlying problems.  The 

coordination and expertise at the state level in these matters is an essential corrective.  To 

the extent that legal settlements are structured in such a way as to generate a broader 

underlying reform of servicing processes, it will be more likely that we can assure 

consumers that they will not encounter other mortgage harms moving forward.   

 The complex challenges faced by the loan servicing industry right now are 

emblematic of the problems that emerge in any industry when incentives are 

fundamentally misaligned, and when the race for short-term profit overwhelms 

sustainable, long-term goals and practices.  Responsible parties within the industry are no 

doubt already scrambling to fix some of the problems that have surfaced.  However, 

because so much is riding on getting these systems right, and because consumers have 

such little measure of individual choice or recourse, reliance on pledges from market 

participants will not be enough.  Many of you have been doing your part for years to 

point out problems in the industry and to give consumers some protection and redress 

when wronged.  The public sector too is stepping up its efforts to monitor firms’ actions 

and systems.  Until a better business model is developed that eliminates the business 

incentives that can potentially harm consumers, there will be a need for close regulatory 

scrutiny of these issues and for appropriate enforcement action that addresses them.  

 Thank you.
