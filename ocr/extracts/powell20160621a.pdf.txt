  I want to thank you all for coming today, and I also want to thank the Alternative 

Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) for all its work in developing its interim report.  This report 

marks a new stage in reference rate reform.1  Reference benchmarks are a key part of the 

financial infrastructure.  About $300 trillion dollars in contracts reference LIBOR alone.  But 

benchmarks were not given much consideration prior to the recent scandals involving attempts to 

manipulate them.  Since then, the official sector has thought seriously about financial 

benchmarks, conducting a number of investigations into charges of manipulation, publishing the 

International Organization of Securities Commission’s (IOSCO) Principles for Financial 

Benchmarks and, through the Financial Stability Board (FSB), sponsoring major reform efforts 

of both interest rate and foreign exchange benchmarks.2  The institutions represented on the 

ARRC have also had to think seriously about these issues as they have developed this interim 

report.  Now, we need end users to begin to think more seriously about how they use benchmarks 

and the risks they are taking on by relying so heavily on a reference rate--in this case U.S. dollar 

LIBOR--that is less resilient than it needs to be.   

In saying this, I want to make it clear that LIBOR has been significantly improved.  ICE 

Benchmark Administration is in the process of making important changes to its methodology, 

and submissions to LIBOR are now regulated by the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct 

Authority.  However, the term money market borrowing by banks that underlies U.S. dollar 

LIBOR has experienced a secular decline.  As a result, the majority of U.S. dollar LIBOR 

submissions must still rely on expert judgement, and even those submissions that are transaction-

based may be based on relatively few actual trades.  This calls into question whether LIBOR can 

ultimately satisfy IOSCO Principle 7 regarding data sufficiency, which requires that a 

benchmark be based on an active market.  That Principle is a particularly important one, as it is 

difficult to ask banks to submit rates at which they believe they could borrow on a daily basis if 

they do not actually borrow very often.   

That basic fact poses the risk that LIBOR could eventually be forced to stop publication 

entirely.  Ongoing regulatory reforms and changing market structures raise questions about 

whether the transactions underlying LIBOR will become even scarcer in the future, particularly 

in periods of stress, and banks might feel little incentive to contribute to U.S. dollar LIBOR 

panels if transactions become less frequent.  Market participants are not used to thinking about 

this possibility, but benchmarks sometimes come to a halt.  The sudden cessation of a benchmark 

as heavily used as LIBOR would present significant systemic risks.  It could entail substantial 

losses and would create substantial uncertainty, potential legal challenges, and payments 

disruptions for the market participants that have relied on LIBOR.  These disruptions would be 

even greater if there were no viable alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR that market participants 

could quickly move to.   

 These concerns led the FSB and Financial Stability Oversight Council to call for the 

promotion of alternatives to LIBOR, and led the Federal Reserve to convene the ARRC in 

cooperation with the U.S. Treasury Department, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 

and Office of Financial Research.  LIBOR is currently the dominant reference rate in the market 

because of its liquidity.  We are not under any illusions that moving a significant portion of 

trading to an alternative rate will be simple or easy.  But I believe the ARRC has provided a

workable and credible plan for creating liquidity in a new rate and beginning the process of 

moving trading to it.     

We need input from end users and others to finalize the ARRC’s plans, and I look 

forward to hearing the views of those in attendance.  Successful implementation will require a 

coordinated effort from a broad set of market participants.  This effort will certainly entail costs, 

but continued reliance on U.S. dollar LIBOR on the current scale could entail much higher costs 

if unsecured short-term borrowing declines further and submitting banks choose to leave the 

LIBOR panels, especially if there were no viable alternative rate.  Simply put, this effort is 

something that needs to happen, and if the ARRC members, the official sector, and end users and 

other market participants all jointly coordinate in finalizing these plans, then a successful 

transition can be made with the least disruption to the market, leaving everyone in a better place.
