I am delighted to be speaking at this annual conference of the Clearing House and 

the Bank Policy Institute.  Today I will discuss recent economic developments and the 

economic outlook before going on to outline my thinking about the connections between 

data dependence and monetary policy.  I will close with some observations on the 

implications for U.S. monetary policy that flow from this perspective.1 

Recent Economic Developments and the Economic Outlook 

U.S. economic fundamentals are robust, as indicated by strong growth in gross 

domestic product (GDP) and a job market that has been surprising on the upside for 

nearly two years.  Smoothing across the first three quarters of this year, real, or inflation-

adjusted, GDP growth is averaging an annual rate of 3.3 percent.  Private-sector forecasts 

for the full year--that is, on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis--suggest that 

growth is likely to equal, or perhaps slightly exceed, 3 percent.  If this occurs, GDP 

growth in 2018 will be the fastest recorded so far during the current expansion, which in 

July entered its 10th year.  If, as I expect, the economic expansion continues in 2019, this 

will become the longest U.S. expansion in recorded history. 

Likewise, the labor market remains healthy.  Average monthly job gains continue 

to outpace the increase needed to provide jobs for new entrants to the labor force over the 

longer run, with payrolls rising by 250,000 in October.  And, at 3.7 percent, the 

unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since 1969.  In addition, after remaining 

stubbornly sluggish throughout much of the expansion, nominal wage growth is picking

up, with various measures now running in the neighborhood of 3 percent on an annual 

basis. 

The inflation data in the year to date for the price index for personal consumption 

expenditures (PCE) have been running at or close to our 2 percent objective, including on 

a core basis--that is, excluding volatile food and energy prices.  While my base case is for 

this pattern to continue, it is important to monitor measures of inflation expectations to 

confirm that households and businesses expect price stability to be maintained.  The 

median of expected inflation 5-to-10 years in the future from the University of Michigan 

Surveys of Consumers is within--but I believe at the lower end of--the range consistent 

with price stability.  Likewise, inflation readings from the TIPS (Treasury Inflation-

Protected Securities) market indicate to me that financial markets expect consumer price 

index (CPI) inflation of about 2 percent to be maintained.  That said, historically, PCE 

inflation has averaged about 0.3 percent less than CPI inflation, and if this were to 

continue, the readings from the TIPS market would indicate that expected PCE inflation 

is running at somewhat less than 2 percent. 

What might explain why inflation is running at or close to the Federal Reserve’s 

long-run objective of 2 percent, and not well above it, when growth is strong and the 

labor market robust?  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, productivity growth in 

the business sector, as measured by output per hour, is averaging 2 percent at an 

annualized rate this year, while aggregate hours worked in the business sector have risen 

at an average annual rate of 1.8 percent through the third quarter.  This decomposition--in 

which the growth in output is broken down into measures of aggregate supply, the growth 

of aggregate hours and the growth of output per hour--suggests that the growth rates of 


 - 3 - 

productivity and hours worked in 2018 each have been exceeding their respective longer-

run rates as estimated by the Congressional Budget Office.2  In other words, while 

growth in aggregate demand in 2018 has been above the expected long-run growth rate in 

aggregate supply, it has not been exceeding this year’s growth in actual aggregate supply. 

Ultimately, hours growth will likely converge to a slower pace because of 

demographic factors.  But how rapidly this happens will depend in part on the behavior of 

labor force participation.  And recent years’ developments suggest there may still be 

some further room for participation in the job market--especially in the prime-age group 

of 25-to-54-year-olds--to rise.  Labor participation by prime-age women has increased 

around 2 percentage points in the past three years and is now at its highest level in a 

decade.  That said, it is still 1-1/2 percentage points below the peak level reached in 2000.  

Labor force participation among 25- to 54-year-old men has risen by roughly 1 

percentage point in the past several years.  But it is still 2 percentage points below levels 

seen a decade ago, and it is 3 percentage points below the levels that prevailed in the late 

1990s. 

As for productivity growth, there is considerable uncertainty about how much of 

the rebound in productivity growth that we have seen in recent quarters is cyclical and 

how much is structural.  I believe both factors are at work.  The structural, or trend, 

component of productivity growth is a function of capital deepening through business 

investment as well as a multifactor component sometimes referred to as the “Solow 

residual.”  Initial estimates from the recent GDP release indicate that equipment and 

software investment in the third quarter moderated from the rapid pace recorded in the

first half of the year.  One data point does not make a trend, but an improvement in 

business investment will be important if the pickup in productivity growth that we have 

seen in recent quarters is to be sustained.   

As for the economic outlook, in the most recent Summary of Economic 

Projections (SEP) released in September, participants had a median projection for real 

GDP growth of 3.1 percent in 2018 and 2-1/2 percent in 2019.  The unemployment rate 

was expected to decline to 3-1/2 percent next year.  And, for total PCE inflation, the 

median projection remains near 2 percent. 

With a robust labor market and inflation at or close to our 2 percent inflation goal 

and based on the baseline economic outlook for 2019 I have just laid out, I believe 

monetary policy at this stage of the economic expansion should be aimed at sustaining 

growth and maximum employment at levels consistent with our inflation objective.  At 

this stage of the interest rate cycle, I believe it will be especially important to monitor a 

wide range of data as we continually assess and calibrate whether the path for the policy 

rate is consistent with meeting our dual-mandate objectives on a sustained basis. 

Data Dependence of Monetary Policy:  What It Means and Why It Is Important  

Economic research suggests that monetary policy should be “data dependent.”3 

And, indeed, central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, often 

describe their policies in this way.  I would now like to discuss how I think about two

distinct roles that data dependence should play in the formulation and communication of 

monetary policy. 

It is important to state up-front that data dependence is not, in and of itself, a 

monetary policy strategy.  A monetary policy strategy must find a way to combine 

incoming data and a model of the economy with a healthy dose of judgment--and 

humility!--to formulate, and then communicate, a path for the policy rate most consistent 

with our policy objectives.  In the case of the Fed, those objectives are assigned to us by 

the Congress, and they are to achieve maximum employment and price stability.  

Importantly, because households and firms must make long-term saving and investment 

decisions and because these decisions--directly or indirectly--depend on the expected 

future path for the policy rate, the central bank should find a way to communicate and 

explain how incoming data are or are not changing the expected path for the policy rate 

consistent with best meeting its objectives.4  Absent such communication, inefficient 

divergences between public expectations and central bank intentions for the policy rate 

path can emerge and persist in ways that are costly to the economy when reversed. 

Within this general framework, let me now consider two distinct ways in which I 

think that the path for the federal funds rate should be data dependent.  U.S. monetary 

policy has for some time and will, I believe, continue to be data dependent in the sense 

that incoming data reveal at the time of each Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) 

meeting where the economy is at the time of each meeting relative to the goals of 

                                                 
4 For example, long-term bond yields can be written as the sum of the expected path of the policy rate plus 
a term premium.  The exchange rate between two countries can be written as the sum of the policy rate path 
differential between two countries plus a risk premium.  So even for households and firms that do not 
directly care about the policy rate path, they do care about long-term bond yields and exchange rates that 
reflect this path.

monetary policy.  This information on where the economy is relative to the goals of 

monetary policy is an important input into the policy decision.  If, for example, incoming 

data in the months ahead were to reveal that inflation and inflation expectations are 

running higher than projected at present and in ways that are inconsistent with our 2 

percent objective, then I would be receptive to increasing the policy rate by more than I 

currently expect will be necessary.  Data dependence in this sense is easy to understand, 

as it is of the type implied by a large family of policy rules in which the parameters of the 

economy are known.5 

But what if key parameters that describe the long-run destination of the economy 

are unknown?  This is indeed the relevant case that the FOMC and other monetary 

policymakers face in practice.  The two most important unknown parameters needed to 

conduct--and communicate--monetary policy are the rate of unemployment consistent 

with maximum employment, u*, and the riskless real rate of interest consistent with price 

stability, r*.  As a result, in the real world, monetary policy should, I believe, be data 

dependent in a second sense:  that incoming data can reveal at each FOMC meeting 

signals that will enable it to update its estimates of r* and u* in order to obtain its best 

estimate of where the economy is heading.6  And, indeed, as indicated by the SEP, 

                                                 
5 See the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2018), Monetary Policy Report (Washington:  
Board of Governors, July), pp. 37-41, 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/20180713_mprfullreport.pdf, or the webpage 
“Monetary Policy Principles and Practice” available on the Federal Reserve Board’s website at 
https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-principles-and-practice.htm for a 
discussion of the policy rate paths implied by five different policy rules using parameter values typically 
assumed in the literature. 
6 If the economy can be described by a linear model in which the only two unknown parameters are r* and 
u* and the shocks that hit the economy are normal, Kalman filtering can be used to derive a closed form 
mathematical expression for how to update one’s estimate of r* and u* as new macro data arrive.  But, in 
practice, “the” model of the economy is neither known, nor linear, and the shocks that strike it are not 
normal.  Thus, monetary policy in practice is, of necessity, as much or more an art than a science.

FOMC participants have, over the past nearly seven years, revised their estimates of both 

u* and r* substantially lower as unemployment fell and real interest rates remained well 

below prior estimates of neutral without the rise in inflation or inflation expectations 

those earlier estimates would have predicted.  And these revisions to u* and r* almost 

certainly did have an important influence on the path for the policy rate that was actually 

realized in recent years.7  I would expect to revise my estimates of r* and u* as 

appropriate if incoming data on future inflation and unemployment diverge materially 

and persistently from my baseline projections today. 

Consequences for Monetary Policy 

What does this mean for the conduct of monetary policy?  As the economy has 

moved to a neighborhood consistent with the Fed’s dual-mandate objectives, risks have 

become more symmetric and less skewed to the downside than when the current rate 

cycle began three years ago.  Raising rates too quickly could unnecessarily shorten the 

economic expansion, while moving too slowly could result in rising inflation and 

inflation expectations down the road that could be costly to reverse, as well as potentially 

pose financial stability risks. 

Although the real federal funds rate today is just below the range of longer-run 

estimates presented in the September SEP,  it is much closer to the vicinity of r* than it 

was when the FOMC started to remove accommodation in December 2015.  How close is 

a matter of judgment, and there is a range of views on the FOMC.  As I have already 

                                                 
7 That was my inference as one who was a Fed watcher until September 17, 2018.  It has also been the 
inference of some private-sector forecasters as well as some other FOMC participants.  For example, see 
Janet L. Yellen (2017), “The Economic Outlook and the Conduct of Monetary Policy,” speech delivered at 
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, Stanford University, Stanford, Calif., January 19,

stressed, r* and u* are uncertain, and I believe we should continue to update our 

estimates of them as new data arrive.  This process of learning about r* and u* as new 

data arrive supports the case for gradual policy normalization, as it will allow the Fed to 

accumulate more information from the data about the ultimate destination for the policy 

rate and the unemployment rate at a time when inflation is close to our 2 percent 

objective.
