Good afternoon.  Thank you Dan, and thank you to everyone gathered here and others 

throughout the System who are listening in.  

To members of Congress, Secretary Lew and others from the administration and fellow financial 

regulatory agencies who are with us today, welcome to the Federal Reserve.  Many friends and 

family of mine are here, including my spouse, George, my brother, John, and my sister-in-law, 

Alison.  I am honored also to welcome back former Chairman Greenspan.  

I want to particularly thank President Obama for the honor of being asked to lead the Federal 

Reserve and carry on its important work.  When I accepted his offer, I promised the president I 

would do my very best, working with my Fed colleagues, to help restore the health of the 

economy and promote a strong and stable financial system. 

I am repeating this promise, in this distinguished company and to all others listening because that 

is what this ceremony is about.  The oath I have affirmed, identical to the one taken by everyone 

serving the Federal Reserve, is a public promise to carry out my duties guided by no interest 

other than the public’s interest.           

Today’s event comes, as many of you know, a busy month after I began my duties as Chair.  In 

that short time, the Board has taken significant steps to further strengthen financial regulation, 

and I have discharged one of my most important responsibilities, accounting for the Fed’s 

actions and explaining its policies in our semi-annual report to Congress.  I’ll do more of that 

explaining in two weeks, when I respond to questions from the media after the next meeting of 

the Federal Open Market Committee.

Such communication is vital in a democracy and especially important for the Federal Reserve, 

which relies on the confidence of the public to be effective in carrying out its mission.  Chairman 

Bernanke initiated press conferences in 2011 as one of a number of steps to make the Federal 

Reserve more transparent and accountable, and I promise to build on his legacy. 

Since 2010, when Chairman Bernanke stood where I stand today, we have made considerable 

progress.  The economy is stronger and the financial system is sounder.  We have come a long 

way, but we have farther to go.  More work lies ahead to complete implementation of Congress’ 

plan for strengthening financial regulation, the Dodd-Frank Act.  I promise to stay focused on 

moving that process forward as quickly and responsibly as possible and to verify that these 

reforms are meeting the goal of safeguarding the financial system. 

I will also continue the work of helping repair the damage done by the financial crisis to the 

economy.  Too many Americans still can’t find a job or are forced to work part-time.  The goals 

set by Congress for the Federal Reserve are clear: maximum employment and stable prices.  It is 

equally clear that the economy continues to operate considerably short of these objectives.  I 

promise to do all that I can, working with my fellow policymakers, to achieve the very important 

goals Congress has assigned to the Federal Reserve. 

I take up these challenges aided by the immensely skilled, talented, and dedicated men and 

women who comprise the Federal Reserve's staff.   Our staff constitute one of the Fed's greatest 

strengths and I am proud to serve with individuals who exhibit the highest standards of 

professionalism and integrity.  They work tirelessly, day in and day out, to serve the public 

interest.  Their skill, creativity and perseverance enabled the Fed to do its part to meet the grave 

threats our nation faced in the financial crisis and then persevere in a disappointingly slow

recovery.  And their knowledge, analysis and judgment will be indispensable in fulfilling the 

mission of the Federal Reserve in the years ahead.     

Congress has entrusted the Federal Reserve with great responsibilities.  The tools we deploy, to 

guide the financial system and influence our vast economy, can seem far removed from the lives 

and concerns of average Americans.  And yet the decisions we make affect the welfare and shape 

the future of every American.  I promise to never forget the individual lives, experiences and 

challenges that lie behind the statistics we use to gauge the health of the economy.  The 

unemployment rate represents millions of individuals who are eager to work but struggling to 

provide for themselves and their families.  When we make progress toward our goals, each job 

that is created lifts this burden for someone who is better equipped to be a good parent, to build a 

stronger community, and to contribute to a more prosperous nation.   

Let me close by offering my heartfelt thanks for the many messages I have received since my 

nomination from individuals around the country who have written to wish me well and offer 

their support.  I pledge to do my very best to meet the challenges that lie ahead.     

Thank you all for coming today.
