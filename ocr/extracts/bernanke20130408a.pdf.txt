Stress Testing Banks:  What Have We Learned? 




Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at 


“Maintaining Financial Stability:  Holding a Tiger by the Tail” 


a Financial Markets Conference 

Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 


Stone Mountain, Georgia 








April 8, 2013 


Let me begin by thanking President Lockhart and the organizers of the Financial 

Markets Conference for inviting me to speak here again this year.  I have participated 

regularly in this conference and have always found it stimulating. 

Four years ago, in remarks at this very conference, I described the 2009 

Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, popularly known as the bank stress 

tests.
1
  The SCAP marked the first time the U.S. bank regulatory agencies had conducted 

a supervisory stress test simultaneously across the largest banking firms.
2
  At the time of 

my 2009 speech, we had just published the results of the SCAP and were still evaluating 

its effects.  In retrospect, the SCAP stands out for me as one of the critical turning points 

in the financial crisis.  It provided anxious investors with something they craved:  

credible information about prospective losses at banks.  Supervisors’ public disclosure of 

the stress test results helped restore confidence in the banking system and enabled its 

successful recapitalization.  The resilience of the U.S. banking system has greatly 

improved since then, and the more intensive use and greater sophistication of supervisory 

stress testing, as well as supervisors’ increased emphasis on the effectiveness of banks’ 

own capital planning processes, deserve some credit for that improvement.  

 I will begin today with a brief discussion of the state of U.S. banking.  I will then 

turn to the subject of what we have learned about stress testing in the four years since the 

SCAP, with a focus on the increasingly central role it is playing in bank supervision in 

the United States.  Importantly, as I will elaborate, stress testing adds a macroprudential

dimension to our supervision by helping us evaluate the aggregate capital position of the 

largest banking firms as well as their individual capital levels. 

 The Federal Reserve--like all bureaucracies--has an unfortunate tendency to 

create acronyms, so, before I proceed further, let me explain our acronyms, in addition to 

SCAP, for stress tests.  With the SCAP now in the past, we currently have two distinct 

but related supervisory programs that rely on stress testing.  The first is the stress testing 

required by the Dodd-Frank Act, which we have shortened to the acronym DFAST--the 

Dodd-Frank Act stress tests.  The purpose of DFAST is to quantitatively assess how bank 

capital levels would fare in stressful economic and financial scenarios.  The second 

program, called the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, combines 

the quantitative results from the stress tests with more-qualitative assessments of the 

capital planning processes used by banks.  For example, under CCAR, supervisors 

evaluate the ability of banks to model losses for various categories of loans and securities 

and to estimate earnings and capital requirements in alternative scenarios.  We recently 

completed the first set of DFAST stress tests and disclosed the results, followed a week 

later by the disclosure of our CCAR findings, which included our qualitative assessments 

of firms’ capital planning.

The State of the Banking System, Then and Now  

 To provide context for the developments in the banking system since the 

introduction of the SCAP in early 2009, it’s worth briefly recalling the economic

 See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Releases Summary 

Results of Bank Stress Tests,” press release, March 7, 

www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20130307a.htm; and Board of Governors of the Federal 

Reserve System (2013), “Federal Reserve Announces Results of Comprehensive Capital Analysis and 

Review (CCAR),” press release, March 14,

situation that prevailed at that time.  The economy was in deep recession, with the 

unemployment rate having risen 4 percentage points, from 5 percent to 9 percent, over 

the preceding 12 months.  The prices of real estate and equities had plummeted, interest 

rate spreads--such as the spread between rates on mortgages and Treasury securities--had 

widened to unprecedented levels, and securitization markets had frozen.  Write-downs 

and losses continued to deplete banks’ capital, unnerving investors and counterparties and 

exacerbating the severe funding pressures faced by many institutions.  In the face of this 

instability, in 2008 and 2009 policymakers had taken a range of extraordinary measures:  

The Federal Reserve supplied liquidity to banks and other financial institutions, helping 

to calm the panic and begin the process of restoring the flow of credit to households and 

businesses; the Treasury Department guaranteed money market funds and injected capital 

into banks under the Troubled Asset Relief Program; the Congress expanded deposit 

insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC); and the FDIC 

guaranteed banks’ issuance of long-term debt.  And, as I noted, the SCAP helped to 

increase confidence in the banking system and restore banks’ access to private capital 

markets.  Ten of the 19 large bank holding companies that underwent the SCAP were 

required to raise equity capital--by $75 billion in total. 

 Today the economy is significantly stronger than it was four years ago, although 

conditions are clearly still far from where we would all like them to be.  Because bank 

credit for households and businesses is critical to continued economic expansion, it is 

positive for the recovery that banks are also notably stronger than they were a few years 

ago.  For example, premiums on bank credit default swaps have fallen by more than half 

of their 2009 levels, and other measures of bank risk have also declined substantially.  


- 4 - 
 

More than 90 percent of the public capital injections that were used to stabilize the 

banking system have been repaid, and the Federal Reserve’s extraordinary liquidity 

programs and the FDIC’s temporary guarantees for uninsured business deposits and bond 

issues have largely been wound down.  

 The results of the most recent stress tests and capital planning evaluations 

continue to reflect improvement in banks’ condition.  For example, projected aggregate 

loan losses under this year’s most stressful scenario (the so-called severely adverse 

scenario) were 7 percent lower than the comparable figure last year, in part because the 

riskiness of banks’ portfolios continues to decline.  The comparison of today’s bank 

capital levels with those at the time of the SCAP is particularly striking.  Over the past 

four years, the aggregate tier 1 common equity ratio of the 18 firms that underwent the 

recent tests has more than doubled, from 5.6 percent of risk-weighted assets at the end of 

2008 to 11.3 percent at the end of 2012--in absolute terms, a net gain of nearly $400 

billion in tier 1 common equity, to almost $800 billion at the end of 2012.  Indeed, even 

under the severely adverse scenario of the latest stress test, the estimate of these firms’ 

post-stress tier 1 common capital ratio is more than 2 percentage points higher than 

actual capital levels at the end of 2008.
4
  Higher capital puts these firms in a much better 

position to absorb future losses while continuing to fulfill their vital role in the economy.  

In addition, a majority of the 18 CCAR firms already meet new internationally agreed-

upon capital standards (the proposed Basel III capital requirements), and the others are on 

track to meet these requirements as they are phased in over time. 

                                                           
4
 On an individual firm basis and taking into consideration planned capital actions--that is, capital raises or 

distributions--all but 1 of the 18 firms evaluated this year had post-stress capital ratios above the regulatory 

minimum. 


- 5 - 
 

 Although the stress tests focus on the largest banks, the medium-sized and smaller 

banks outside of the 18 CCAR firms have also improved their aggregate capital position 

considerably since the SCAP.  For that group of banks, aggregate tier 1 common equity 

stood at 12.4 percent of risk-weighted assets in the fourth quarter of 2012, more than 4 

percentage points higher than at the end of 2008.   

 Another key lesson of the crisis, given the intense funding pressures experienced 

by many financial institutions during the period, is the importance of maintaining 

adequate liquidity--that is, a stock of cash and unencumbered high-quality liquid assets 

that can be converted easily into cash.  Here too, the news is mostly positive, as the 

broader banking system--including both larger and smaller banks--has generally 

improved its liquidity position relative to pre-crisis levels.  For example, banks’ holdings 

of cash and high-quality liquid securities have more than doubled since the end of 2007 

and now total more than $2.5 trillion.  However, in the area of liquidity and funding, 

continued improvement is still needed on some dimensions.  Notably, supervisors will 

continue to press banks to reduce further their dependence on wholesale funding, which 

proved highly unreliable during the crisis.  And, in analogy to the need for effective 

capital planning, banks of all sizes need to further strengthen their ability to identify, 

quantify, and manage their liquidity risks.  

The Evolution of Stress Testing 

 Let me turn now to the evolution of stress testing as a supervisory tool.  The main 

benefits of stress tests for supervision have not changed much since the SCAP was 

conducted in 2009.  First, stress tests complement standard capital ratios by adding a 

more forward-looking perspective and by being more oriented toward protection against 


- 6 - 
 

so-called tail risks; by design, stress tests help ensure that banks will have enough capital 

to keep lending even under highly adverse circumstances.  Second, as applied by the 

Federal Reserve, the stress tests look horizontally across banks rather than at a single 

bank in isolation.  This comparative approach promotes more-consistent supervisory 

standards.  It also provides valuable systemic information by revealing how significant 

economic or financial shocks would affect the largest banks collectively as well as 

individually.  Third, the disclosures of stress test results promote transparency by 

providing the public consistent and comparable information about banks’ financial 

conditions.   

 The basic methodology of our stress testing has also not changed materially since 

the SCAP.  We continue to take a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on a wide range of 

staff expertise.  To begin the process, our economists create a hypothetical 

macroeconomic scenario that incorporates an assumed sharp deterioration in economic 

and financial conditions.  Supervisors estimate each bank’s expected losses and revenues 

and we use these estimates to project post-stress capital levels and ratios under that 

hypothetical scenario.  The estimated capital ratios are then compared with regulatory 

benchmarks. We use a common scenario for all firms; for the firms with the largest 

trading activities, we supplement the basic scenario with a market-shock scenario that 

incorporates market turbulence of severity similar to that of the latter half of 2008.     

 Although the basic goals and approach of stress testing have remained largely 

unchanged since the SCAP, the implementation has evolved and improved from year to 

year.  For example, we have continued to refine the formulation of the hypothetical 

scenarios that form the basis of the stress tests.  As explained in a statement we released 


- 7 - 
 

in the fall, the severely adverse scenario is designed to reflect, at a minimum, the 

economic and financial conditions typical of a severe post-World War II U.S. recession.
5
  

In devising recession scenarios, we draw on many of the same macroeconomic modeling 

tools used in making monetary policy.  Of course, not all significant risks facing banks 

are tied to the business cycle.  Accordingly, our scenarios now generally incorporate not 

only the typical consequences of a severe recession but also, simultaneously, other 

adverse developments such as an exceptionally large decline in house prices, sharp drops 

in the value of stocks and other financial assets, or a worsening of global economic 

conditions more severe than might normally be expected to accompany a deep recession 

in the United States.   

 Importantly, in specifying the severely adverse scenario, we seek to avoid adding 

to the procyclicality of the financial system.  In other words, in applying stress tests, we 

do not want to inadvertently set a standard that is easier to meet in good times (when 

banks should be preparing for possibly tougher times ahead) than in bad times (when 

banks need to be able to use accumulated capital to support lending).  Accordingly, we 

will want to ensure that the stress scenario remains severe in an absolute sense even when 

the economy is strong and the near-term risks to the outlook seem relatively modest. 

 We have also improved our tools for estimating projected bank losses, revenues, 

and capital under alternative scenarios.  The original SCAP was supervisors’ first attempt 

to produce comprehensive and simultaneous estimates of the financial conditions of the 

nation’s largest banking firms, and the required data and analytical methods were

developed under great time pressure.  Of necessity, when projecting losses and revenues 

under alternative SCAP scenarios, supervisors relied on the firms’ own estimates as a 

starting point.  Although we scrutinized and questioned the firms’ estimates and made 

significant adjustments based on our own analysis, for that inaugural round of stress tests, 

it was not possible to produce completely independent estimates.   

 However, over the past four years, considerable progress has been made in data 

collection and in the development of independent supervisory models.  For our most 

recent supervisory stress tests, we collected and analyzed loan- and account-level data on 

more than two-thirds of the $4.2 trillion in accrual loans and leases projected to be held 

by the 18 firms we evaluated this year.  Those detailed data include borrower, loan, and 

collateral information on more than 350 million domestic retail loans, including credit 

cards and mortgages, and more than 200,000 commercial loans.  Currently, the Federal 

Reserve uses more than 40 models to project how categories of bank losses and revenues 

would likely respond in hypothetical scenarios.  The improvements in data and models 

have increased our ability to distinguish risks within portfolios.  Importantly, these 

supervisory models are evaluated by a special model validation group made up of experts 

within the Federal Reserve who do not work on the stress tests.  We have also created a 

Model Validation Council made up of external experts to provide independent views and 

advice.

  These ongoing efforts are bringing us close to the point at which we will be able

to estimate, in a fully independent way, how each firm’s loss, revenue, and capital ratio 

would likely respond in any specified scenario.  

 Another innovation since the SCAP is the increased supervisory focus on banks’ 

internal capital planning practices, which are reviewed as part of CCAR.  We see the 

requirement that banks with assets of $50 billion or more submit annual capital plans to 

the Federal Reserve as a critical enhancement.
7
  While regulatory minimums and 

supervisory expectations provide floors for acceptable capital levels, the firms and their 

boards of directors are responsible for assessing their own capital needs over and above 

the minimums.  Our supervisors scrutinize their practices and assess their capacity to 

fulfill that responsibility.  In particular, we require firms to formulate their own scenarios 

that capture the risks that they face, and to assess potential losses and revenues under 

both the supervisory scenarios and their internal scenarios over a nine-quarter horizon.  In 

CCAR, our qualitative assessment of a firm’s capital planning is integrated with the 

quantitative results of both the supervisory and company-run stress tests.   

 The Federal Reserve continues to increase the transparency of our stress testing 

process, the results of the exercises, and our assessments of banks’ capital planning.  The 

original SCAP set a new standard of supervisory transparency in disclosing bank-by-bank 

estimates of stress losses by type of exposure.  This departure from the traditionally 

confidential treatment of supervisory information, as I noted earlier, was intended to 

restore public confidence by providing much-needed information about banks’ potential

 A capital plan describes a firm’s capital planning strategies and its processes for measuring potential 

capital needs both under expected and stressed operating environments and for ensuring that it is holding 

adequate capital to be able to continue to function even under stress.  See Board of Governors of the 

Federal Reserve System (2011), “Capital Plans,” final rule (Docket No. R-1425), Federal Register, vol. 76 

(December 1), pp. 74631-48, www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/12/01/2011-30665/capital-plans.

losses and capital needs.  In last month’s results, in addition to projected losses and 

revenues, we disclosed for the first time whether we had objected to each firm’s capital 

plan.
8
  Also for the first time, banks were required to disclose their own estimates of 

stressed losses and revenues.  The disclosures by banks give investors and analysts an 

alternative perspective on the test results; they also help them form judgments about 

banks’ appetites for risk and their risk-management practices, particularly their abilities 

to measure losses in a severe downturn.  Even outside of a period of crisis, the disclosure 

of stress test results and assessments provides valuable information to market participants 

and the public, enhances transparency, and promotes market discipline. 

 In the four years since the SCAP, the Federal Reserve’s stress testing program has 

been expanded and strengthened through both statute and regulation.  The Dodd-Frank 

Act widened the scope of stress testing to all bank holding companies with $50 billion or 

more in total consolidated assets (approximately 11 companies in addition to the original 

SCAP participants) and to nonbank financial companies designated by the Financial 

Stability Oversight Council as systemically important, and therefore subject to 

consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve.  Dodd-Frank also requires these 

companies to conduct their own stress tests twice a year.  In October, the Federal Reserve 

Board adopted rules implementing these requirements.
9
  The 11 additional companies 

with assets of $50 billion or more will be subject to DFAST and CCAR for the first time 

next year.

 While no institutions below $50 billion in assets are subject to supervisory stress 

testing or the requirements of CCAR, the Dodd-Frank Act does require that institutions 

with between $10 billion and $50 billion in assets conduct their own stress tests.
10

  The 

initial tests by these firms will begin this year and will be completed by March.  While 

we believe that stress testing will help medium-sized institutions better understand the 

risks they face, we tailored our rule for these institutions to take account of differences in 

size, complexity, and business models.  We specifically exempted community banking 

organizations with $10 billion or less in total assets from the requirement that they run 

their own stress tests as those institutions cannot reasonably be expected to have the 

resources that larger banks devote to stress testing.
11


Benefits and Challenges of Stress Testing 

 As already noted, stress testing has a number of important benefits as a 

supervisory tool.  From a microprudential perspective, the CCAR provides a structured 

means for supervisors to assess not only whether banks hold enough capital, but also 

whether banks are able to rapidly and accurately determine their risk exposures, an 

essential element of effective risk management.  The cross-firm nature of the stress tests 

also helps supervisors identify outliers--both in terms of results and practices--that can 

provide a basis for further, more targeted reviews.

www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/bcreg/20120514b.htm. 


- 12 - 
 

 From a macroprudential perspective, the use of a common scenario allows us to 

learn how a particular risk or combination of risks might affect the banking system as a 

whole--not just individual institutions.  This experience with stress testing has indeed 

been very useful for our efforts to better monitor and evaluate potential systemic risks.  

For example, in our macroprudential work, as in our stress tests, we tend to rely on 

horizontal examinations and comparative studies, as opposed to firm-by-firm 

assessments; we use multidisciplinary, specialized teams to supplement the work of on-

site examiners; and we have increased our use of modeling and quantitative methods, 

using data drawn from different institutions and time periods.  All of these features are 

apparent in the workings of our Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, 

which provides coordinated oversight of the supervision of systemically important firms.  

We have also extended the lessons of systemwide stress testing to analysis of factors 

other than capital:  For example, we recently completed a horizontal review of liquidity 

positions and liquidity risk-management practices at some of the largest CCAR firms.  

Like the CCAR review of capital planning, this review was a multidisciplinary effort that 

used quantitative information--in this case, detailed data on firms’ liquidity positions--as 

well as qualitative information on liquidity risk-management practices. 

Notwithstanding the demonstrated benefits of comprehensive stress testing, this 

evolving tool also presents challenges.  For example, even as we continue to explore 

ways to enhance the transparency of the models we use to estimate banks’ projected 

revenues and losses, we have chosen not to publish the full specification of these models.  

As a result, we hear criticism from bankers that our models are a “black box,” which 

frustrates their efforts to anticipate our supervisory findings.  We agree that banks should 


- 13 - 
 

understand in general terms how the supervisory models work, and, even more 

importantly, they need to be confident that our models are empirically validated and 

sound.  I mentioned our internal efforts at model validation, which have increased the 

quality and accuracy of our models.  We have also begun to host an annual stress test 

modeling symposium, which provides a venue for regulators, bankers, academics, and 

others to share their views.  Over time, we expect banks to better understand the basic 

elements of the supervisory models, rendering them at least somewhat less opaque.  

At the same time, it is reasonable to worry that, with increased disclosure of 

supervisory models, firms would see a declining benefit to maintaining independent risk-

management systems and would just adopt supervisory models instead.  Doing so would 

certainly make it easier to “pass” the stress tests.  However, all models have their blind 

spots, and such an outcome risks a “model monoculture” that would be susceptible to a 

single, common failure.  The differences in stress test results obtained by supervisors’ 

and banks’ own models can be informative, and we do not want inadvertently to destroy 

the healthy diversity or innovation of the models and other risk-management tools used in 

the banking industry. 

Another challenge is that our stress scenarios cannot encompass all of the risks 

that banks might face.  For example, although some operational risk losses, such as 

expenses for mortgage put-backs, are incorporated in our stress test estimates, banks may 

face operational, legal, and other risks that are specific to their company or are otherwise 

difficult to estimate.  It is important for banking firms to consider the potential for losses 

from these other classes of risks as systematically as possible, and supervisors also 


- 14 - 
 

account for these risks as best they can.  Of course, unforeseen events are inevitable, 

which is why maintaining a healthy level of capital is essential. 

Conclusion  

As I have discussed today, the banking system is much stronger since the 

implementation of the SCAP four years ago, which in turn has contributed to the 

improvement in the overall economy.  The use of supervisory stress tests--a practice now 

codified in statute--has helped foster these gains.  Methodologically, stress tests are 

forward looking and focus on unlikely but plausible risks, as opposed to “normal” risks.  

Consequently, they complement more conventional capital and leverage ratios.  The 

disclosure of the results of supervisory stress tests, coupled with firms’ disclosures of 

their own stress test results, provide market participants deeper insight not only into the 

financial strength of each bank but also into the quality of its risk management and 

capital planning.  Stress testing is also proving highly complementary to supervisors’ 

monitoring and analysis of potential systemic risks.  We will continue to make 

refinements to our implementation of stress testing and our CCAR process as we learn 

from experience.  

 As I have noted, one of the most important aspects of regular stress testing is that 

it forces banks (and their supervisors) to develop the capacity to quickly and accurately 

assess the enterprise-wide exposures of their institutions to diverse risks, and to use that 

information routinely to help ensure that they maintain adequate capital and liquidity.  

The development and ongoing refinement of that risk-management capacity is itself 

critical for protecting individual banks and the banking system, upon which the health of 

our economy depends.
