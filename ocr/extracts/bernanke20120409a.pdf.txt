Fostering Financial Stability 




Remarks by 


Ben S. Bernanke 


Chairman 


Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 


at the 


2012 Financial Markets Conference 

Sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta 


Atlanta, Georgia 








April 9, 2012 





I commend the organizers of this conference for the event’s apt subtitle:  “The 

Devil’s in the Details.”  For the Federal Reserve and other financial regulators, getting 

the details right is crucial as we implement the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and 

Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) and strive to meet our broader financial 

stability responsibilities.  About three and a half years have passed since the darkest days 

of the financial crisis, but our economy is still far from having fully recovered from its 

effects.  The heavy human and economic costs of the crisis underscore the importance of 

taking all necessary steps to avoid a repeat of the events of the past few years. 

Tonight I will discuss some ways in which the Federal Reserve, since the crisis, 

has reoriented itself from being (in its financial regulatory capacity) primarily a 

supervisor of a specific set of financial institutions toward being an agency with a broader 

focus on systemic stability as well.  I will highlight some of the ways we and other 

agencies are working to increase the resiliency of systemically important financial firms 

and identify and mitigate systemic risks, including those associated with the so-called 

shadow banking system.  I will also discuss the broad outlines of our evolving approach 

to monitoring financial stability.  Our efforts are a work in progress, and we are learning 

as we go.  But I hope to convey a sense of the strong commitment of the Federal Reserve 

to fostering a more stable and resilient financial system. 

Systemically Important Financial Firms 

Banking Institutions 

Since the crisis, the Federal Reserve has made important strides in the traditional, 

microprudential regulation and supervision of individual banking organizations.  

Promoting the safety and soundness of individual financial firms is a critical

responsibility.  To an increasing extent, however, we have also been working to embed 

our supervisory practices within a broader macroprudential framework that focuses not 

only on the conditions of individual firms but also on the health of the financial system as 

a whole.   

Even before the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, we had begun to overhaul our 

approach to supervision to better achieve both microprudential and macroprudential 

goals.  In 2009, we created the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee--a 

high-level, multidisciplinary working group, drawing on skills and experience from 

throughout the Federal Reserve System--and charged it with overseeing the supervision 

of the most systemically important financial firms.  Through the coordinating committee, 

we have supplemented the traditional, firm-by-firm approach to supervision with a 

routine use of horizontal, or cross-firm, reviews to monitor industry practices, common 

trading and funding strategies, balance sheet developments, interconnectedness, and other 

factors with implications for systemic risk.  Drawing on the work of economists and 

financial market experts, the coordinating committee has also made increasing use of 

improved quantitative methods for evaluating the conditions of supervised firms as well 

as the risks they may pose to the broader financial system. 

 An important example of our strengthened, cross-firm supervisory approach is the 

recently completed second annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review 

(CCAR).

  In the CCAR, the Federal Reserve assessed the internal capital planning

processes of the 19 largest bank holding companies and evaluated their capital adequacy 

under a very severe hypothetical stress scenario that included a peak unemployment rate 

of 13 percent, a 50 percent drop in equity prices, and a further 21 percent decline in 

housing prices.  From a traditional safety-and-soundness perspective, we looked at 

whether each firm would have sufficient capital to remain financially stable, taking into 

account its capital distribution proposal, under the stress scenario.  The simultaneous 

review, by common methods, of the nation’s largest banking firms also helped us better 

evaluate the resilience of the system as a whole, including the capacity of the banking 

system to continue to make credit available to households and businesses if the economy 

were to perform very poorly.  Because stress tests will be an enduring part of the 

supervisory toolkit, we are evaluating the recent exercise particularly closely to identify 

both the elements that worked well and the areas in which execution and communication 

can be improved.  

 We also now routinely use macroprudential methods in analyzing the potential 

consequences of significant economic events for the individual firms we supervise and 

for the financial system as a whole.  A good example is our response to the European 

sovereign debt concerns that emerged in the spring of 2010.  Since those concerns arose, 

we have been actively monitoring U.S. banks’ direct and indirect exposures to Europe 

and tracking the banks’ management of their exposures.  We have also been analyzing 

scenarios under which European sovereign debt developments might lead to broader 

dislocations, for example, through a sharp increase in investor risk aversion that 

adversely affects asset values.  This work not only has improved our understanding of

banks’ individual risk profiles, it also has helped us better evaluate the potential effects of 

financial disruptions in Europe on credit flows and economic activity in the United 

States.  

Macroprudential considerations are being incorporated into the development of 

new regulations as well as into supervision.  For example, in December, the Federal 

Reserve issued a package of proposed rules to implement sections 165 and 166 of the 

Dodd-Frank Act.  The rules would establish prudential standards for the largest bank 

holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial firms, standards that 

become more stringent as the systemic footprint of the firm increases.  We are also 

collaborating with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and foreign 

authorities to help implement the FDIC’s new resolution authority for systemically 

critical firms.  In particular, last fall we issued a joint rule with the FDIC that requires 

each of these firms to produce a credible plan--known as a living will--for an orderly 

resolution in the event of its failure. 

In the international arena, we strongly supported the Basel Committee’s adoption 

in the summer of 2009 of tougher regulatory capital standards for trading activities and 

securitization exposures.  We have also worked closely with international partners to help 

develop the Basel III framework, which requires globally active banks to hold more and 

higher-quality capital and larger liquidity buffers, and which now incorporates a 

provision to impose capital surcharges based on firms’ global systemic importance.  

These surcharges are intended to reduce the risk of failure of systemic firms and also to 

force these firms, in their decisions regarding their size and complexity, to internalize the 

possible costs that those decisions might impose on the broader economic and financial 


  - 5 -  




system.  The purpose of each of these steps is to improve the traditional prudential 

regulation of systemically important firms while fostering greater stability and resilience 

in the banking system as a whole.    

Nonbank Financial Firms 

Gaps in the regulatory structure, which allowed some systemically important 

nonbank financial firms to avoid strong, comprehensive oversight, were a significant 

contributor to the crisis.  The Federal Reserve has been working with the other member 

agencies of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), established by the Dodd-

Frank Act, to close these regulatory gaps.  On April 3 the FSOC issued a final rule and 

interpretive guidance implementing the criteria and process it will use to designate 

nonbank financial firms as systemically important.
2
  Once designated, these firms would 

be subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve and would be required to 

satisfy enhanced prudential standards established by the Federal Reserve under title I of 

Dodd-Frank.  The FSOC’s rule provides detail on the framework the FSOC intends to use 

to assess the potential for a particular firm to threaten U.S. financial stability.  The 

analysis would take into account the firm’s size, interconnectedness, leverage, provision 

of critical products or services, and reliance on short-term funding, as well as its existing 

regulatory arrangements. 

The FSOC’s issuance of this rule is an important step forward in ensuring that 

systemically critical nonbank financial firms will be subject to strong consolidated 

supervision and regulation.  More work remains to be done, however.  In particular,

although the basic process for designation has now been laid out, further refinement of 

the criteria for designation will be needed; and, for those firms that are ultimately 

designated, it will fall to the Federal Reserve to develop supervisory frameworks 

appropriate to each firm’s business model and risk profile.  As the FSOC gains 

experience with this process, it will make adjustments to its rule and its procedures as 

appropriate.  

Regulation of Shadow Banking 

 I have been discussing the oversight of systemically important financial 

institutions in a macroprudential context.  However, an important lesson learned from the 

financial crisis is that the growth of what has been termed “shadow banking” creates 

additional potential channels for the propagation of shocks through the financial system 

and the economy.  Shadow banking refers to the intermediation of credit through a 

collection of institutions, instruments, and markets that lie at least partly outside of the 

traditional banking system.   

 As an illustration of shadow banking at work, consider how an automobile loan 

can be made and funded outside of the banking system.  The loan could be originated by 

a finance company that pools it with other loans in a securitization vehicle.  An 

investment bank might sell tranches of the securitization to investors.  The lower-risk 

tranches could be purchased by an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduit that, 

in turn, funds itself by issuing commercial paper that is purchased by money market 

funds.  Alternatively, the lower-risk tranches of loan securitizations might be purchased 

by securities dealers that fund the positions through collateralized borrowing using 


  - 7 -  




repurchase (repo) agreements, with money market funds and institutional investors 

serving as lenders.  

Although the shadow banking system taken as a whole performs traditional 

banking functions, including credit intermediation and maturity transformation, unlike 

banks, it cannot rely on the protections afforded by deposit insurance and access to the 

Federal Reserve’s discount window to help ensure its stability.  Shadow banking depends 

instead upon an alternative set of contractual and regulatory protections--for example, the 

posting of collateral in short-term borrowing transactions.  It also relies on certain 

regulatory restrictions on key entities, such as the significant portfolio restrictions on 

money market funds required by rule 2a-7 of the Securities and Exchange Commission 

(SEC), which are designed to ensure adequate liquidity and avoid credit losses.  During 

the financial crisis, however, these types of measures failed to stave off a classic and self-

reinforcing panic that took hold in parts of the shadow banking system and ultimately 

spread across the financial system more broadly.   

 An important feature of shadow banking is the historical and continuing 

involvement of commercial and clearing banks--that is, more “traditional” banking 

institutions.  For example, commercial banks sponsored securitizations and ABCP 

conduits, arrangements which, until recently, permitted those banks to increase their 

leverage by keeping the underlying assets off their balance sheets.  Clearing banks stand 

in the middle of triparty repo agreements, managing the exchange of cash and securities 

while providing protection and liquidity to both transacting parties.  Moreover, to ease 

operational frictions, clearing banks extend very large amounts of temporary intraday 

credit to borrowers and lenders each day.  This temporary intraday credit--averaging 


  - 8 -  




about $1.4 trillion--allows securities dealers access to their securities (for example, the 

tranches of loan securitizations mentioned earlier) during trading hours. 

 Because of these and other connections, panics and other stresses in shadow 

banking can spill over into traditional banking.  Indeed, the markets and institutions I 

mentioned--the repo market, the ABCP market, and money market funds--all suffered 

panics to some degree during the financial crisis.  As a result, many traditional financial 

institutions lost important funding channels for their assets; in addition, for reputational 

and contractual reasons, many banks supported their affiliated funds and conduits, 

compounding their own mounting liquidity pressures.   

Status of Shadow Banking Reform Efforts 

 Given the substantial stakes, I am encouraged that both regulators and the private 

sector have begun to take actions to prevent future panics and other disruptions in shadow 

banking.  However, in many key areas these efforts are still at early stages. 

A first set of reforms relate to the accounting and regulatory capital treatment of 

shadow banking entities sponsored by traditional banks.  The Financial Accounting 

Standards Board finalized a rule in 2009 that requires securitizations and other structured 

finance vehicles, in certain situations, to be consolidated onto the sponsoring bank’s 

balance sheet.  In the context of regulatory capital, Basel 2.5 and Basel III addressed 

interconnectedness and other sources of systemic risk frequently associated with shadow 

banking by raising capital requirements for exposures to unregulated financial 

institutions, such as asset managers, hedge funds, and credit insurers, and by 

strengthening the capital treatment of liquidity lines to off-balance-sheet structures.  


  - 9 -  




Basel III also includes quantitative liquidity rules that reflect contractual and other risks 

that arise from bank sponsorship of off-balance-sheet vehicles. 

 A second area of ongoing reform is money market funds.  In an important step 

toward greater stability, the SEC in 2010 amended its regulations to, among other things, 

require that money market funds maintain larger buffers of liquid assets, which may help 

reassure investors and reduce the likelihood of runs.  Notwithstanding the new 

regulations, the risk of runs created by a combination of fixed net asset values, extremely 

risk-averse investors, and the absence of explicit loss absorption capacity remains a 

concern, particularly since some of the tools that policymakers employed to stem the runs 

during the crisis are no longer available.  SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro has advocated 

additional measures to reduce the vulnerability of money market funds to runs, including 

possibly requiring funds to maintain loss-absorbing capital buffers or to redeem shares at 

the market value of the underlying assets rather than a fixed price of $1.  Alternative 

approaches to ensuring the stability of these funds have been proposed as well.  

Additional steps to increase the resiliency of money market funds are important for the 

overall stability of our financial system and warrant serious consideration. 

 A third set of emerging reforms is aimed at repo markets, an area in which the 

Federal Reserve has taken an active role.  The initial efforts have focused on the 

vulnerabilities created by the large amounts of intraday credit provided by clearing banks 

in the triparty repo market.  Intraday credit, while a great convenience in normal times, 

may foster systemic risk by creating large mutual exposures between securities dealers 

and clearing banks.  In times of market stress, a dealer default on intraday credit extended 

could be large enough to pose a threat to the stability of the clearing bank--institutions 


  - 10 -  




tightly connected to the rest of the financial system.  But were a clearing bank to decline 

to provide intraday credit to a dealer, that dealer’s ability to operate normally would be 

substantially compromised, likely causing difficulties for its clients and counterparties, 

including many other financial institutions.  As a result, during a period of market stress, 

the actions of clearing banks can jeopardize the stability of securities dealers, and vice 

versa. 

 An industry task force recognized this mutual vulnerability in 2010 and 

recommended the “practical elimination” of intraday credit in the triparty repo market.  

Although some progress has been made, securities dealers and clearing banks have yet to 

fully implement that recommendation.  Nevertheless, through supervision and other 

means, we continue to push the industry toward this critical goal.  In doing so, we are 

collaborating with other agencies, notably the SEC, which has regulatory responsibility 

for money market funds and securities dealers, institutions that are active in the triparty 

repo market.  At the same time, we continue to urge market participants to improve their 

risk-management practices, and, in particular, to ensure that tools are in place to address 

the risks that would be posed to the repo market by the default of a major firm.   

 International regulatory groups have also been focused on addressing the financial 

stability risks of shadow banking.  The Group of Twenty leaders have directed the 

Financial Stability Board (FSB), whose membership consists of key regulators from 

around the world, including the Federal Reserve, with developing policy 

recommendations to strengthen the regulation of the shadow banking system.  The FSB 

currently has five major projects under way devoted to understanding the risks of, and 

developing policy recommendations for, shadow banking.  The areas under study include 


  - 11 -  




money market funds, securitization, securities lending and the repo market, banks’ 

interactions with shadow banks, and “other” shadow banking entities.  Given the 

substantial variation in the structure of shadow banking in different countries, the FSB’s 

agenda is ambitious.  But it is also critical in light of the potential risks to stability from 

shadow banking and the ease with which shadow banking entities can create 

intermediation chains across national borders.  

Monitoring Financial Stability 

 I’ve outlined a number of ongoing efforts, both domestic and international, to 

bring the shadow banking system into the sunlight, so to speak, and to impose tougher 

standards on systemically important financial firms.  But even as we make progress on 

known vulnerabilities, we must be mindful that our financial system is constantly 

evolving, and that unanticipated risks to stability will develop over time.  Indeed, an 

inevitable side effect of new regulations is that the system will adapt in ways that push 

risk-taking from more-regulated to less-regulated areas, increasing the need for careful 

monitoring and supervision of the system as a whole. 

At the Federal Reserve, we have stepped up our monitoring efforts substantially 

in recent years, with much of the work taking place under the auspices of our recently 

created Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research.  We conduct an active program 

of research and data collection, often in conjunction with other U.S. and foreign 

regulators and supervisors, including our fellow members on the FSOC.  In addition, by 

making use of resources throughout the Federal Reserve System, we are developing a 

framework and infrastructure for monitoring systemic risk.  Our goal is to have the 

capacity to follow developments in all segments of the financial system, including parts 


  - 12 -  




of the financial sector for which data are scarce or that have developed more recently and 

are thus less well understood.  This work complements and is closely coordinated with 

our efforts, mentioned earlier, to supervise systemically important banking organizations 

from a macroprudential perspective.  For example, based on public data, we develop and 

monitor measures of systemic importance that reflect firms’ interconnectedness and their 

provision of critical services.  

  Unfortunately, data on the shadow banking sector, by its nature, can be more 

difficult to obtain.  Thus, we have to be more creative to monitor risk in this important 

area.  We look at broad indicators of risk to the financial system, such as measures of risk 

premiums, asset valuations, and market functioning.  We try to gauge the risk of runs by 

looking at indicators of leverage (both on and off balance sheet) and tracking short-term 

wholesale funding markets, especially for evidence of maturity mismatches between 

assets and liabilities.  We are also developing new sources of information to improve the 

monitoring of leverage.  For example, in 2010, we began a quarterly survey on dealer 

financing (the Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms) that 

collects information on the leverage that dealers provide to financial market participants 

in the repo and over-the-counter derivatives markets.
3
  In addition, we are working with 

other agencies to create a comprehensive set of regulatory data on hedge funds and 

private equity firms. 

  Broader economic developments can also create risks to financial stability.  To 

assess such risks, we regularly monitor a number of metrics, including, for example, the 

leverage of the nonfinancial sector.  In addition, we use data from the flow of funds

Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/releases/scoos.htm.

accounts to assess how much nonfinancial credit is ultimately being funded with short-

term debt.
4
  This assessment is important because an overleveraged nonfinancial sector 

could serve to amplify shocks, to the detriment of the functioning of the financial sector 

and broader economy.  Our judgment of how the financial sector is affecting economic 

activity reflects both information on lenders--most notably, underwriting standards, risk 

appetite, and balance sheet capacity--and analytical indicators of macroeconomic 

vulnerability to financial risks.  Meanwhile, efforts are under way, both at the Federal 

Reserve and elsewhere, to evaluate and develop new macroprudential tools and to 

develop early warning indicators that could help identify and limit future buildups of 

systemic risk.  

 In the decades prior to the financial crisis, financial stability policy tended to be 

overshadowed by monetary policy, which had come to be viewed as the principal 

function of central banks.  In the aftermath of the crisis, however, financial stability 

policy has taken on greater prominence and is now generally considered to stand on an 

equal footing with monetary policy as a critical responsibility of central banks.  We have 

spent decades building and refining the infrastructure for conducting monetary policy.  

And although we have done much in a short time to improve our understanding of 

systemic risk and to incorporate a macroprudential perspective into supervision, our 

framework for conducting financial stability policy is not yet at the same level.  

Continuing to develop an effective set of macroprudential policy indicators and tools,

 The Federal Reserve’s statistical release “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States” provides detailed 

information on patterns of financial intermediation through a consolidated set of balance sheets for the 

household, business, and government sectors and financial institutions.  The flow of funds accounts are
