Good afternoon.  I am pleased to be with you, and it is good to be back in 

Providence.  As many of you know, I attended Brown University, and the city I see today 

is very different from the one I remember from my time here in the 1960s.  Many of 

those differences reflect dramatic and, at times, wrenching economic changes in Rhode 

Island over those years, especially since the financial crisis and the Great Recession.  As 

ever, Providence has faced these challenges, and I am impressed by the revival and 

renewal evident downtown, encouraged by attractions like Waterfire, which bring visitors 

and commerce here and build civic pride. 

Today I would like to speak with you about the outlook for the U.S. economy.  I 

should note at the outset that my remarks today reflect my own views and not necessarily 

those of others in the Federal Reserve System. 

The Recession and the Recovery So Far 

As you all know, the economy is still recovering from the Great Recession, the 

worst downturn since the terrible episode of the 1930s that inspired its name.  The 

recession began more than seven years ago, the result of the collapse in the housing 

market and the financial crisis that it sparked.  Rhode Islanders are well aware of the 

great toll taken by the recession.  The unemployment rate hit 10 percent nationally, and it 

reached 11.3 percent here in Rhode Island.  Nationally, payrolls shrank by some 8-1/2 

million, about 6 percent, and the 41,000 jobs lost in Rhode Island represented close to 

8 percent of the state’s employment.  U.S. economic output fell more than 4 percent 

nationally, the most since the Great Depression, and many of the hardest-hit industries,

including housing construction and manufacturing, are important to the Rhode Island 

economy.1  

The Federal Reserve took action to help stabilize the financial system during the 

crisis, and we have supported the economic recovery with monetary policy actions 

designed to hold down longer-term interest rates.  With this help, the economy has made 

significant strides.  The pace of job gains has gradually strengthened, and payrolls 

expanded by more than 3 million in 2014 alone.  The unemployment rate has come down 

steadily to 5.4 percent in April.  One sign of a stronger labor market is that the number of 

job openings has risen impressively, and another is that more workers are quitting their 

jobs, signaling greater confidence in their ability to find a new job.   

Rhode Island is sharing in this recovery, but I am well aware that economic 

conditions remain difficult here.  Rhode Island’s unemployment rate improved very 

slowly during the recovery, and, for a time, it was the highest of any state.  The jobless 

rate has come down a lot over the past year or so, but at 6.3 percent in March, 

unemployment here remains above the national average, and payroll employment has yet 

to regain its pre-recession peak.   

In recent months, some economic data have suggested that the pace of 

improvement in the economy may have slowed, a topic I will address in a moment.  And 

even with the significant gains of the past couple years, it is only now, six years after the 

recession ended, that the labor market is approaching its full strength.

I say “approaching,” because in my judgment we are not there yet.  The 

unemployment rate has come down close to levels that many economists believe is 

sustainable in the long run without generating inflation.  But the unemployment rate 

today probably does not fully capture the extent of slack in the labor market.  To be 

classified as unemployed, people must report that they are actively seeking work, and 

many people without jobs say they are not doing so--that is, they are classified as being 

out of the labor force.  Most people out of the labor force are there voluntarily, including 

retirees, teenagers, young adults in school, and people staying home to care for children.  

But I also believe that a significant number are not seeking work because they still 

perceive a lack of good job opportunities.  

In addition to those too discouraged to seek work, an unusually large number of 

people report that they are working part time because they cannot find full-time jobs, and 

I suspect that much of this also represents labor market slack that could be absorbed in a 

stronger economy.  Finally, the generally disappointing pace of wage growth also 

suggests that the labor market has not fully healed.  Higher wages raise costs for 

employers, of course, but they also boost the spending and confidence of customers and 

would signal a strengthening of the recovery that will ultimately be good for business.  In 

the aggregate, the main measures of hourly compensation rose at a rate of only around 

2 percent through most of the recovery.  And in Rhode Island, average hourly earnings 

have not risen at all in the past year.  Nationally, there are at least some encouraging 

signs of a pickup so far this year.2  The fact that some large companies, such as Wal-Mart 

2 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) employment cost index--which measures both wages 
and the cost of employer-provided benefits--hourly compensation in private industry rose 2-3/4 percent 
over the year ended in March after having averaged gains of about 2 percent per year during most of the 
recovery.  However, some other prominent aggregate wage measures have remained softer.  For example,

and Target, have announced wage increases for their employees also might be a sign that 

larger wage gains are on the horizon.  

This improvement in the labor market has brought the economy closer to one of 

the two goals of monetary policy assigned to the Fed by the Congress--maximum 

employment.  Less progress has been made toward the other goal, price stability.  

Consumer price inflation remains below the Fed’s stated objective of 2 percent.  The 

notion that inflation can be too low may sound odd, but over time low inflation means 

that wages as well as prices will rise by less, and very low inflation can impair the 

functioning of the economy--for example, by making it more difficult for households and 

firms to pay off their debts.  Overall consumer price inflation has been especially low--

close to zero--over the past year, as the big fall in oil prices since last summer lowered 

prices for gasoline, heating oil, and other energy products.  But inflation excluding food 

and energy, which is often a better indicator of where overall inflation will be in the 

future, has also been low, below the Fed’s 2 percent objective both now and for almost all 

of the economic recovery.  Inflation has been held down by the continued economic 

weakness during the slow recovery and, more recently, by lower prices of imported 

goods as well as the fall in oil prices.  With oil prices no longer declining, and with the 

public’s expectations of future inflation apparently stable, my colleagues on the Federal 

Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I believe that consumer price inflation will move 

up to 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as other temporary factors 

weighing on inflation recede.   

the BLS’s average hourly earnings for all employees on nonfarm payrolls have increased 2-1/4 percent over 
the 12 months through April.  




 - 5 - 

A number of economic headwinds have slowed the recovery, and to some extent 

they continue to influence the outlook.  These headwinds include, first, the fact that the 

housing crash left many households with less wealth and higher debt, weighing on 

consumer spending.  Many homeowners lost their homes, and many more ended up 

“underwater,” owing more on their mortgages than their homes were worth.  Economists 

have noted that areas of the country that saw a larger boom and bust in housing have 

subsequently fared worse economically than other areas of the country.3  Rhode Island is 

one such place.  While the housing bust was not as large here as in Florida, Nevada, and 

parts of California, it was larger than average, and the largest in New England.  This 

factor likely has contributed to the fact that the overall recovery here in Rhode Island has 

lagged.4  

In some respects, this headwind has diminished.  Home prices have moved up 

appreciably in many areas of the country, alleviating the burden for many homeowners, 

though the improvement in some areas, including Rhode Island, has lagged.  Nationally, 

the share of mortgages that are underwater fell by about one-half between 2011 and 

2014.5  And credit availability for mortgages has improved as well, although mortgages 

are still very hard to obtain for would-be homeowners without pristine credit records.  So 

I would score this headwind as still a concern, but one that is likely to continue to fade.  

A second headwind, also quite important here in Rhode Island, has come from 

changes in fiscal policy to reduce budget deficits.  At the federal level, the fiscal stimulus

and How We Can Prevent It from Happening Again (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press). 
4 See Burke, “Rhode Island in the Great Recession,” in note 1. 
5 The share varies by source of data.  According to Zillow’s October 2014 Real Estate Market Overview, 
the share of mortgages in negative equity positions declined from about 30 percent in 2011 to 17 percent in 
2014.  According to CoreLogic’s 4th quarter 2014 Equity Report, the share declined from about 25 percent 
to 11 percent over that period. 




 - 6 - 

of 2008 and 2009 supported economic output, but the effects of that stimulus faded; by 

2011, federal fiscal policy actions became a drag on output growth when the recovery 

was still weak.  Meanwhile, states and municipalities, faced with serious budget problems 

due to the recession and required by law to balance their budgets, were forced to cut 

spending and raise taxes.  The recovery has by now boosted tax revenue in most states, 

though Rhode Island, I know, is among those areas still facing considerable budget strain.  

Overall, fiscal policy actions at both the federal and the state and local levels look like 

they are no longer a significant drag on economic growth.  So this headwind, I hope, is 

mostly behind us.  

A third headwind has been the restraining influences on the United States from 

the global economy.  I won’t say as much about this factor today, but I will make just a 

few observations.  Initially the euro-area crisis was the biggest headwind coming from 

the rest of the world.  Supported by monetary stimulus, reduced fiscal drag, and 

significant institutional reforms, the recovery in the euro area now appears to be on a 

firmer footing.  However, growth in many other parts of the global economy, including 

China and some other emerging market economies, has slowed.  Weak growth abroad, 

together with its accompanying implications for exchange rates, has dented U.S. exports 

and weighed on our economy.  This headwind too should abate as growth in the global 

economy firms, supported by monetary policies that generally remain highly 

accommodative.     

Factors Affecting the Outlook  

With the waning of the headwinds that I have discussed, the U.S. economy seems 

well positioned for continued growth.  Households are seeing the benefits of the 


 - 7 - 

improving jobs situation, and consumer confidence has been solid.  In addition, the drop 

in oil prices amounts to a sizable boost in household purchasing power.  The annual 

savings in gasoline costs has been estimated at about $700 per household, on average, 

and savings on heating costs--especially here in the Northeast, where it was so cold this 

winter--are also large.6  Given these energy savings on top of the job gains, real 

disposable income has risen almost 4 percent nationally over the past four quarters.  

Households and businesses also are benefiting from favorable financial conditions.  

Borrowing costs are low, supported by the Fed’s accommodative monetary policies.  And 

credit availability to both households and small businesses has improved. 

In recent months, as I noted earlier, there has been some softness in the economic 

data.  Recent indicators of both household spending and business investment have 

slowed, and industrial output has declined.  The Commerce Department’s initial estimate 

was that real gross domestic product was nearly flat in the first quarter of 2015.  If 

confirmed by further estimates, my guess is that this apparent slowdown was largely the 

result of a variety of transitory factors that occurred at the same time, including the 

unusually cold and snowy winter and the labor disputes at ports on the West Coast, both 

of which likely disrupted some economic activity.  And some of this apparent weakness 

may just be statistical noise.  I therefore expect the economic data to strengthen.   

All of that said, the headwinds facing our economy have not fully abated, and, as 

such, I expect that continued growth in employment and output will be moderate over the 

remainder of the year and beyond.

Despite the recovery I noted in home prices and a greater number of home sales, 

residential construction activity remains quite low.  I mentioned the ongoing issues with 

mortgage credit, but more generally, many years of a weak job market and slow wage 

gains seem to have induced many people to double-up on housing, and many young 

adults continue to live with their parents.  Population growth is creating a need for more 

housing, whether to rent or to own, and I do expect that continuing job and wage gains 

will encourage more people to form new households.  Nevertheless, activity in the 

housing sector is likely to improve only gradually. 

The pace of business investment has also been only modest during this recovery, 

and some of the reasons might persist a while longer.  Businesses seem not to have had 

sufficient confidence in the strength and durability of the recovery to undertake 

substantial capital expenditures.  Moreover, some analysts have suggested that 

uncertainty, not only about the strength of the recovery but also about economic policy, 

could be a significant factor.  And the fact that many businesses seem to be holding large 

amounts of cash may suggest that risk aversion is playing a role.   

Weak investment in the energy sector is also likely to persist.  This represents the 

negative side to the fall in oil prices, one being felt by the oil-producing regions of the 

country.  New domestic oil drilling has plunged over the past few months, and we have 

also seen a slowdown in activity in sectors that supply oil production companies, 

including steel and certain types of machinery.  I would add, however, that, on balance, 

the plusses for energy consumers from the fall in oil prices almost surely outweigh the 

minuses.  Remember that we are still a net importer of oil. 


 - 9 - 

Putting it all together, the economic projections of most members of the FOMC 

call for growth in real gross domestic product of roughly 2-1/2 percent per year over the 

next couple of years, a little faster than the pace of the recovery thus far, with the 

unemployment rate continuing to move down to near 5 percent by the end of this year.  

And for inflation, as I noted earlier, my colleagues and I expect inflation to move up 

toward our objective of 2 percent as the economy strengthens further and as transitory 

influences wane. 

Of course, the outlook for the economy, as always, is highly uncertain.  I am 

describing the outlook that I see as most likely, but based on many years of making 

economic projections, I can assure you that any specific projection I write down will turn 

out to be wrong, perhaps markedly so.  For many reasons, output and job growth over the 

next few years could prove to be stronger, and inflation higher, than I expect; 

correspondingly, employment could grow more slowly, and inflation could remain 

undesirably low.   

Implications for Monetary Policy  

Given this economic outlook and the attendant uncertainty, how is monetary 

policy likely to evolve over the next few years?  Because of the substantial lags in the 

effects of monetary policy on the economy, we must make policy in a forward-looking 

manner.  Delaying action to tighten monetary policy until employment and inflation are 

already back to our objectives would risk overheating the economy.   

For this reason, if the economy continues to improve as I expect, I think it will be 

appropriate at some point this year to take the initial step to raise the federal funds rate 

target and begin the process of normalizing monetary policy.  To support taking this step, 


 - 10 - 

however, I will need to see continued improvement in labor market conditions, and I will 

need to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the 

medium term.   

After we begin raising the federal funds rate, I anticipate that the pace of 

normalization is likely to be gradual.  The various headwinds that are still restraining the 

economy, as I said, will likely take some time to fully abate, and the pace of that 

improvement is highly uncertain.  If conditions develop as my colleagues and I expect, 

then the FOMC’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability would best be 

achieved by proceeding cautiously, which I expect would mean that it will be several 

years before the federal funds rate would be back to its normal, longer-run level.   

Having said that, I should stress that the actual course of policy will be 

determined by incoming data and what that reveals about the economy.  We have no 

intention of embarking on a preset course of increases in the federal funds rate after the 

initial increase.  Rather, we will adjust monetary policy in response to developments in 

economic activity and inflation as they occur.  If conditions improve more rapidly than 

expected, it may be appropriate to raise interest rates more quickly; conversely, the pace 

of normalization may be slower if conditions turn out to be less favorable.  

Longer-Run Growth 

Before I conclude, let me put this discussion into a longer-term context.  The 

Federal Reserve’s objectives of maximum employment and price stability do not, by 

themselves, ensure a strong pace of economic growth or an improvement in living 

standards.  The most important factor determining living standards is productivity 


 - 11 - 

growth, defined as increases in how much can be produced in an hour of work.  Over 

time, sustained increases in productivity are necessary to support rising incomes. 

Here the recent data have been disappointing.  The growth rate of output per hour 

worked in the business sector has averaged about 1-1/4 percent per year since the 

recession began in late 2007.  This rate is down from gains averaging 2-3/4 percent over 

the preceding decade.  I have mentioned the tepid pace of wage gains in recent years, and 

while I do take this as evidence of slack in the labor market, it also may be a reflection of 

relatively weak productivity growth. 

Productivity depends on many factors, including our workforce’s knowledge and 

skills and the quantity and quality of the capital, technology, and infrastructure that they 

have to work with.  Economists debate how optimistic to be about our nation’s 

productivity prospects.  Some argue that the decade starting in the mid-1990s was 

exceptional, with unusually large advances in information technologies, and that the more 

recent period provides a better guide to the future.  Others are more optimistic, suggesting 

that recent technological innovation remains as impressive as ever, and that history shows 

it may take some years to fully reap the economic benefits of such innovations.7  I do not 

know who is right, but I do believe that, as a nation, we should be pursuing policies to

Headwinds,” NBER Working Paper Series 18315 (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic

Press), pp. 83-89; and Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee (2014), The Second Machine Age:  Work, 
Progress, and Prosperity in a Time of Brilliant Technologies (New York:  W.W. Norton & Company).  The 
greatest return to adopting information technology appears five to seven years after investment, according 
to Erik Brynjolfsson and Lorin M. Hitt (2003), “Computing Productivity:  Firm-Level Evidence,” Review 
of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November), pp. 793-808.

support longer-run growth in productivity.  Policies to strengthen education, to encourage 

entrepreneurship and innovation, and to promote capital investment, both public and 

private, can all be of great benefit.  

It also is possible that a portion of the relatively weak productivity growth we 

have seen recently may be the result of the recession itself.8  Firms slashed their capital 

expenditures during the recession, and as I noted earlier, the increases in investment 

during the recovery have been modest.  In particular, investment in research and 

development has been relatively weak.  Moreover, a lack of financing may have impaired 

the ability of people to start new businesses and implement new ideas and technologies.  

As the economy strengthens further, many of these processes could work in reverse, 

boosting our productivity prospects.  To the extent this is so, Federal Reserve actions to 

strengthen the recovery may not only help bring our economy back to its productive 

potential, but it may also support the growth of productivity and living standards over the 

longer run.
