Housing Trust Fund Allocation Plans  
 

When can States submit HTF allocation plans to HUD? 

Updated: June 19, 2015 

As it has in prior years, HUD will publish a Community Planning and Development (CPD) 
Notice for FY 2016 to instruct CDBG, HOME, ESG, HOPWA and HTF grantees on the timing 
of the submission of consolidated and annual action plans. HTF grantees may not submit their 
HTF allocation plans to HUD for review and approval until the HTF formula allocations have 
been published. The earliest HUD expects to publish the HTF formula allocations is April, 
2016.  
 
It is possible that formula allocations for other CPD formula programs (CDBG, HOME, HOPWA 
and ESG) will be available before HTF formula allocations are published. A State or State-
designated entity that submits its annual action plan for these formula grant programs before 
the HTF formula allocations are published must submit its HTF allocation plan as a substantial 
amendment to its annual action plan, after the HTF formula allocations have been published. 

When can subgrantees submit HTF allocation plans to HUD?  

Updated: June 19, 2015 

Before a subgrantee can submit its HTF allocation plan to HUD, two conditions must be 
satisfied. First, pursuant to 24 CFR 91.320(k)(5), the State must submit and HUD must 
approve an HTF allocation plan that addresses its intent to award HTF funds to subgrantees. 
Second, pursuant to 24 CFR 93.404(b), the State must execute a written agreement awarding 
funds to a subgrantee for HTF activities. The subgrantee’s HTF allocation plan must address 
all required elements of the written agreement with the State. Depending on the timing of the 
agreement between the State and the subgrantee, the subgrantee’s HTF allocation plan will 
generally be a substantial amendment to an already approved annual action plan.  

How will States and subgrantees submit HTF allocation plans to HUD? 

Updated: June 19, 2015 
 
In May 2012, HUD’s Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) introduced the 
eCon Planning Suite, including the Consolidated Plan template in IDIS On-Line and the CPD 
Maps website. HUD grantees are now required to submit their consolidated plan and annual 
action plan using the Consolidated Plan template in IDIS On-Line. Therefore, HTF grantees 
and subgrantees must use the eCon Planning Suite to submit their HTF allocation plans to 
HUD. However, for the first year of the program, the Suite may not include fields for the HTF 
allocation plan. If this is the case, grantees and subgrantees will be required to upload a Word 
or similar file containing their plans to the eCon Planning Suite.  HUD will provide a sample 
format for HTF grantees and subgrantees to use when uploading the HTF allocation plan to 
the eCon Planning Suite. Grantees and subgrantees may still use the eCon Planning Suite 
data and tools to identify priority housing needs and make strategic investment decisions for 
their HTF programs.
