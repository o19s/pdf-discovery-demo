When was the Housing Trust Fund (HTF) functionality implemented in IDIS and how do I 
gain access to this system? 

Updated: August 3, 2016 
 
The Housing Trust Fund (HTF) was implemented in HUD’s Integrated Disbursement and 
Information System (IDIS) on Monday, July 25, 2016. HUD requires HTF grantees to use IDIS 
when committing funds to HTF-assisted projects, disbursing HTF funds for eligible costs, and 
reporting HTF accomplishments. HTF grantees must complete an IDIS Online Access Form in 
order to gain access to the system for HTF. The form must be signed by the grantee official 
approving the user request. This signature must be notarized. The completed, signed, and 
notarized IDIS Online Access Form should be submitted to the HTF grantee’s local HUD field 
office for final signature and processing. Please note that current IDIS users that have user 
rights for other CPD programs (e.g., HOME, CDBG, ESG, HOPWA, etc.) are not required to 
complete a new IDIS Online Access Form for the HTF program. The HTF program can be 
added to an active user profile by the Local Grantee or Field Office Administrators. 
 
Please submit any questions regarding IDIS access for HTF to your local HUD field office, or 
the Ask a Question portal located on the HUD Exchange. To submit a question to the IDIS 
AAQ portal, select “IDIS: Integrated Disbursement and Information System” from the “My 
question is related to” drop down list on Step 2 of the question submission process.  

When must a State notify HUD which agency will administer its Housing Trust Funds 
(HTF) and how does a State designate the State agency or State-Designated Entity to 
administer the HTF program? 

Updated: February 13, 2015 

Per 24 CFR 93.100, each State is required to notify (the Secretary of) HUD of its intent to 
become a grantee for HTF funding within 30 days after HUD publishes the formula allocation 
amounts (these amounts are expected to be published by April 2016). The notification letter 
must also inform HUD of the contact information for the State department/agency or State-
Designated Entity (SDE) that will administer its HTF funds. Only one State department/agency 
or SDE can be designated as the HTF grantee.
