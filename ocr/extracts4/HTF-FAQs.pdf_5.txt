Can a unit of general local government which is not a direct recipient of 
HUD formula grant funds be an HTF subgrantee? 

Updated: June 19, 2015 
 
No. 24 CFR 93.2 defines a “subgrantee” as a unit of general local government that has an 
approved consolidated plan submitted in accordance with 24 CFR 91. The regulations at 24 
CFR Part 91 require units of general local government which receive CDBG, HOME, ESG or 
HOPWA formula funds to develop and submit a consolidated plan and/or annual action plan, 
outlining the use of the formula funds. Therefore, by definition, an eligible HTF subgrantee 
must be a direct formula grantee that submits a consolidated plan and annual action plans.  

Can States or State-Designated Entities (SDEs) begin their planning and 
citizen participation process prior to the publication of the HTF formula 
allocations? (UPDATED)

HUD is aware that some States have Annual Action Plan submission dates in early 2016 and 
would like to include HTF Allocation Plans in citizen participation hearings that they will 
conduct for their Action Plans. Before deciding to include HTF in Annual Action Plan hearings 
that take place before HTF allocations are available, States should consider that there are no 
2015 baseline figures upon which to estimate 2016 HTF allocations. This may make it difficult 
to achieve meaningful citizen participation and meet the Consolidated Plan citizen participation 
requirements established at 24 CFR 91.115. In addition, HUD intends to issue guidance on 
maximum subsidy limits and operating cost assistance later this year, which may prove useful 
to States as they develop their program design. Lastly, grantees are required to conduct citizen 
participation before submitting a substantial amendment to the Annual Action Plan, which may 
negates any time or cost savings that were achieved by including the HTF Allocation Plan in 
Annual Action Plan hearings.  
 
HUD encourages States and SDEs to engage with their stakeholders (e.g. community 
organizations, general public, housing partners, etc.) through informal meetings or planning 
sessions that make information available, inform design of their HTF program, and otherwise 
contribute to a meaningful citizen participation process.
