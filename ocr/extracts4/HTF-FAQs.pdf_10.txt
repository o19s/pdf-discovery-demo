HUD continues its efforts to narrow the digital divide in low-income communities served by 
HUD by providing, where feasible and with HUD funding, broadband infrastructure to 
communities in need of such infrastructure.  

Broadband is the common term used to refer to a very fast connection to the Internet. Such 
connections are also referred to as high-speed broadband or high-speed Internet.  

Although HUD plans to issue regulations that will formalize its steps for narrowing the digital 
divide, Housing Trust Fund program funds can be used for broadband installation 
infrastructure and service delivery. 

May Housing Trust Fund (HTF) grant funds be used when developing 
(constructing or rehabilitating) housing with these funds and what costs 
related to broadband internet access are eligible? 

Yes. Under § 93.201(a) in the HTF rule, HTF funds may be used for the actual costs of 
constructing or rehabilitating (development hard costs) single family or multifamily housing, 
including the costs to wire the property for broadband internet. The costs to make utility 
connections, including off-site connections from the property line to the adjacent street are also 
eligible under HTF at § 93.201(a) (3) (ii). HUD includes internet connectivity in the regulatory 
definition of “utility connections.”  

For both new construction and rehabilitation of multifamily rental projects, HTF funds may be 
used for costs to construct or rehabilitate community facilities that are located within the same 
building as the housing, and which are for the use of the project residents. However, HTF 
funds cannot pay for a computer room located in a separate building from the assisted 
housing.  

HTF funds also may not pay for equipment or furniture in the computer room. 

If a multi-unit project does not contain 100 percent HTF-assisted units, only a portion of the 
cost of providing broadband internet access in the project or the cost to construct a computer 
room may be charged to the HTF program because only the actual HTF eligible development 
costs of the assisted units may be charged to the program in accordance with the HTF rule at 
§ 93.200(c) (1). 

All HTF-assisted housing must meet the minimum property standards at § 93.301 upon 
completion, so efforts to provide broadband internet access in existing housing must be 
undertaken as part of rehabilitation that brings the housing up to the property standards.  

May HTF funds be used to make broadband internet connections to 
housing? 

Yes. As part of a new construction or rehabilitation activity, the HTF rule at § 93.201(a) (3) (ii) 
states that HTF may pay for the development costs to make utility connections, including 
connections from the property line to the adjacent street. This includes broadband internet 
connections.  

However, HTF cannot be used for any off-site improvements, including running broadband 
internet cable or wires to the project site. Use of HTF funds is limited to the improvements on
