Maximum Per Unit Development Subsidy 
 

How should States establish maximum per-unit development subsidy 
amounts for Housing Trust Fund (HTF) projects? 

Pursuant to 24 CFR 93.300(a), all HTF grantees must establish maximum limitations on the 
total amount of HTF funds that the grantee may invest per-unit for development of non-luxury 
housing. The limits must be “reasonable” and based on actual costs of developing non-luxury 
housing in any given geographical area. Each grantee must submit maximum per-unit 
development subsidy amounts and accompanying justification with its HTF Allocation Plan on 
an annual basis. 

There are a number of factors grantees should consider when developing maximum per-unit 
development subsidy amounts. 

First, maximum per-unit development subsidy amounts must be adjusted for number of 
bedrooms and for the geographic location of the project. Because actual construction and land 
costs vary by areas, Grantees will establish multiple limits for the State. If a Grantee 
determines that a single limit is appropriate for the entire State, it must submit documentation 
supporting its determination that there is not a significant variation in construction or land costs 
across the State. 

Second, maximum per-unit development subsidy amounts must be based upon actual total 
development costs, including costs that are not eligible to be paid with HTF and costs funded 
from sources other than HTF. The subsidy limits should take into account the cost of meeting 
applicable codes and standards for rehabilitation or new construction in the area. 

Finally, maximum per-unit development subsidy amounts must reflect the costs associated 
with meeting all applicable HTF program requirements and other federal requirements. 
Specifically, the limits should account for all costs associated with producing housing units for 
extremely low-income families and costs associated with meeting priority housing needs of the 
State (e.g., green building standards, accessibility for special needs populations, etc.).  

If a grantee chooses to provide HTF funds as operating cost assistance or operating cost 
assistance reserves to an HTF-assisted rental project, that assistance does not count towards 
the maximum per-unit development subsidy amount. However, the operating cost subsidies 
are still capped at 30 percent of each annual grant.  

Grantees may choose to establish new maximum per-unit development subsidy amounts for 
projects funded with HTF, or they may choose to use existing limits developed for other federal 
programs such as the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) per unit cost limits, HOME’s 
maximum per-unit subsidy amounts, and/or Public Housing Development Cost Limits (TDCs). 
As part of its HTF Allocation Plan, each grantee must submit a description of how the HTF 
maximum per-unit development subsidy amounts were established or a description of how 
existing limits developed for another program and being adopted for HTF meet the HTF 
requirements. Also, grantees must maintain program files for each annual HTF grant that 
include documentation of how the limits were established, and reflect actual costs that are 
reasonable for developing non-luxury housing.
