 Accessibility requirements at 24 CFR part 8 (implementing section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973) and Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities 
Act implemented at 28 CFR parts 35 and 36. 

 For “covered multifamily dwellings,” as defined at 24 CFR 100.205, standards 
must require that the housing meets the design and construction requirements at 
24 CFR 100.205.  (Note that grantees may use HTF funds for other 
improvements that permit use by a person with disabilities, even if they are not 
required by statute or regulation.) 


5) Disaster Mitigation – Where relevant, the standards must require the housing to be 
improved to mitigate the potential impact of potential disasters (e.g., earthquakes, 
hurricanes, floods, and wildfires) in accordance with state or local codes, ordinances, and 
requirements, or such other requirements that HUD may establish.  


6) State and Local Codes, Ordinances, and Zoning Requirements – The standards must 
require the housing to meet all applicable State and local codes, ordinances, and 
requirements. In the absence of State or local building codes, the housing must meet the 
International Existing Building Code of the International Code Council. 

 
7) Uniform Physical Condition Standards (UPCS) – Standards must ensure that the 

housing will be decent, safe, sanitary, and in good repair as described in 24 CFR 5.703. 
While States are not required to adopt the standards of criticality or use the HUD’s Real 
Estate Assessment Center’s (REAC) scoring protocol, each State’s standards must include 
the UPCS inspectable items and observable deficiencies for the Site, Building Exterior, 
Building Systems (multifamily housing only), Common Areas (multifamily housing only), 
and Units identified on the following charts. The rehabilitation standards must identify the 
type and degree of deficiency that must be addressed. View the HTF FAQ Appendices: 
Uniform Physical Condition Standards for Multifamily and Single Family Housing 
Rehabilitation. Appendix A applies to HTF-funded multifamily housing undergoing 
rehabilitation. Appendix B applies to HTF-funded single family housing undergoing 
rehabilitation.
