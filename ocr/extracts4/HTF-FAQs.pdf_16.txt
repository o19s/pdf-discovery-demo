Rehabilitation Standards 
 

What are the required elements of rehabilitation standards established by 
States for rental or homebuyer housing being rehabilitated with HTF 
funds? 

States must establish rehabilitation standards that all HTF-assisted housing undergoing 
rehabilitation must meet at the time of project completion, pursuant to the HTF implementing 
regulations at 24 CFR 93.301(b). If a State intends to use its HTF funds for housing being 
rehabilitated, it must submit its standards to HUD as part of its HTF allocation plan. The 
standards submitted to HUD must contain sufficient detail to determine the rehabilitation work 
required in a project and the methods and materials to be used.  

A State’s standards may refer to applicable codes or may establish requirements that exceed 
the minimum requirements of the codes. At a minimum, a State’s rehabilitation standards must 
address: 

1) Health and Safety – Identify life-threatening deficiencies, which must be addressed 
immediately if the housing is occupied at the time of rehabilitation. 

 
2) Major Systems – Including structural support, roofing; cladding and weatherproofing (e.g., 

windows, doors, siding, gutters); plumbing; electrical; and heating, ventilation, and air 
conditioning. 


 Requirements for Rental Housing  
o Standards must require an estimate (based on age and condition) of the 

remaining useful life of these systems, upon project completion of each major 
system.  

o For multifamily housing with 26 or more total units, the useful life of systems 
must be determined through a capital needs assessment that determines the 
work to be performed and identifies the long-term physical needs of the 
project.  

o If the remaining useful life of one or more major system is less than the 
applicable period of affordability, the standards must require the grantee to 
ensure a replacement reserve is established and adequate monthly payments 
are made to repair or replace the systems as needed. 

 Requirements for Homebuyer Housing – The standards must require that, upon 
completion, each of the major systems have a minimum useful life of 5 years (or a 
longer period, if established by the grantee) or the major systems must be 
rehabilitated or replaced as part of the rehabilitation work. 
 

3) Lead-Based Paint – Standards must require housing to meet applicable provisions of 24 
CFR part 35. 


4) Accessibility – Standards must require housing to meet:
