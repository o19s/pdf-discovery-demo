At the State level, selection of a State agency or designation of a SDE to administer its HTF 
funds will typically be made by the Governor or State Legislature in accordance with State law. 
The definition of a SDE for HTF can be found at 24 CFR 93.2. If a State designates a SDE to 
administer its HTF funds, a copy of the designation must be included in this transmittal. 

States are encouraged to designate the State department/agency or SDE that will administer 
its HTF funds early in order to facilitate receipt of guidance and training from HUD 
timely. Therefore, States may submit the above referenced notification letter any time prior to 
the deadline. 

The notification letter should be addressed/sent to: 

The Honorable Julián Castro 
Secretary 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development 
451 7th Street S.W., Washington, DC 20410 
Fax: (202) 619-8365 

Will States be allowed to charge pre-award costs for HTF planning 
activities? 

Updated: June 19, 2015 

Yes. HUD has determined that pre-award costs for planning activities and preparation of the 
HTF allocation plan will be allowed. Preparation includes the cost of public hearings, 
consultations and publication of public notices. For the first year, pre-award costs may not 
exceed one half of the State’s administrative funds (which is, 10% of the formula allocation).
