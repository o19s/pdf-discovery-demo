Do Davis-Bacon Labor Standards apply to the HTF? 

Updated: June 19, 2015 

No. The HTF was established under Title I of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 
2008, Section 1131 (Public Law 110-289). This statute did not make the labor standards of 
Davis-Bacon applicable to the HTF. Therefore, in order to be consistent with the statute, HUD 
did not require Davis-Bacon labor standards on the HTF in the interim rule.
