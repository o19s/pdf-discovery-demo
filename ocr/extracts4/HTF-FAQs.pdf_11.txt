the project site, i.e., the land, owned by the project owner, upon which the HTF-assisted 
project is located. 

Further, the HTF rule at ยง 93.200(d)(1) specifies that only the actual HTF eligible development 
costs of the assisted units may be charged to the program. If a multi-unit project does not 
contain 100 percent HTF-assisted units, then only a portion of the cost of the utility 
connections may be charged to the HTF program.  

May HTF funds be used to provide a computer room in a multifamily rental 
project?  

Yes. As part of new construction and rehabilitation costs of multifamily rental projects, the HTF 
rule at ยง 93.201(a) (4) states that HTF funds may be used for costs to construct or rehabilitate 
community facilities that are located within the same building as the housing, and which are for 
the use of the project residents. HTF funds cannot be used to pay for a computer room located 
in a separate building from the assisted housing.  

While HTF funds may be used to construct a multi-purpose room that could serve as a 
computer room, HTF funds may not be used for the purchase of furniture or equipment.  

If a multi-unit project does not contain 100 percent HTF-assisted units, then only a portion of 
the cost of a computer room may be charged to the HTF program because only the actual HTF 
eligible development costs of the assisted units may be charged to the program in accordance 
with the HTF rule at ยง 93.200(c) (1).  

May HTF funds be used to provide computer equipment in a multifamily 
rental project? 

No. HTF funds may not be used to pay for furniture or equipment for a computer room, even 
as part of a multifamily assisted rental property.
