  "content": " For release on delivery  1:00 p.m. EST  March 7, 2016      Reflections on Macroeconomics Then and Now         Remarks by     Stanley Fischer     Vice Chairman     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System     at     “Policy Challenges in an Interconnected World”  32nd Annual National Association for Business Economics Economic Policy Conference     Washington, D.C.    March 7, 2016       I am grateful to the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) for   conferring the fourth annual NABE Paul A. Volcker Lifetime Achievement Award for   Economic Policy on me, thereby allowing me the honor of following in the footsteps of   Paul Volcker, Jean-Claude Trichet, and Alice Rivlin.1  The honor of receiving the award   is enhanced by its bearing the name of Paul Volcker, a model citizen and public servant,   and a giant in every sense among central bankers.     One thinks of many things on an occasion such as this one.  My mind goes back   first to growing up in a very small town in Zambia, then Northern Rhodesia, and to the   surprise and delight my parents would have felt at seeing me standing where I am now.    They would have been even more delighted that my girlfriend, Rhoda, whom I met when   my parents moved to a bigger town in Zimbabwe, and I have been happily married for   50 years.  But that is not the story I will tell today.  Rather, I want to talk about our field,   macroeconomics, and some of the lessons we have learned in the course of the last   55 years--and I say 55 years, because in 1961, at the end of my school years, on the   advice of a friend, I read Keynes’s General Theory for the first time.      Did I understand it?  Certainly not.  Was I captivated by it?  Certainly, though   “captured” is a more appropriate word than “captivated.”  Does it remain relevant?    Certainly.  Just a week ago I took it off the bookshelf to read parts of chapter 23, “Notes   on Mercantilism, the Usury Laws, Stamped Money and Theories of Under-  Consumption.”  Today that chapter would be headed “Protectionism, the Zero Lower                                                     1 I am grateful to David Lopez-Salido, Andrea Ajello, Elmar Mertens, Stacey Tevlin, and Bill English of  the Federal Reserve Board for their assistance.  Views expressed are mine, and are not necessarily those of  the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Open Market Committee.     - 2 -   Bound, and Secular Stagnation,” with the importance of usury laws having diminished   since 1936.   There is an old joke about our field--not the one about the one-handed economist,   nor the one about “assume you have a can opener,” nor the one that ends, “If I were you,   I wouldn’t start from here.”  Rather it’s the one about the Ph.D. economist who returns to   his university for his class’s 50th reunion.  He asks if he can see the most recent Ph.D.   generals exam.  After a while it is brought to him.  He reads it carefully, looking   perplexed, and then says, “But this is exactly the same as the exam I wrote over 50 years   ago.”  “Ah yes,” says the professor.  “It is the same, but all the answers are different.”   Is that really the case?  Not really, though it is true to some extent in the realm of   policy.  To discuss the question of whether the answers to the questions of how to deal   with macroeconomic policy problems have changed markedly over the past half-century   or so, I will start by briefly sketching the structure of a basic macro model.  The building   blocks of this model are similar to those used in many macro models, including FRB/US,   the Fed staff’s large-scale model, and a variety of DSGE (dynamic stochastic general   equilibrium) models used at the Fed and other central banks and by academic researchers.     The structure of the model starts with the standard textbook equation for   aggregate demand for domestically produced goods, namely:2   (1) AD = C + I + G + NX;   (2) Next is the wage-price block, which is based on a wage or price Phillips   curve.  Okun’s law is included to make the transition between output and   employment;                                                     2 A fuller description of the equations is contained in the appendix.     - 3 -   (3) Monetary policy is described by a money supply or interest rate rule;   (4) The credit markets and financial intermediation are built off links between the   policy interest rate and the rates of return on, and/or demand and supply   functions for, other assets;   (5) The balance of payments and the exchange rate enter through the balance of   payments identity, namely that the current account surplus must be equal to   the capital account deficit, corrected for official intervention;   (6) Dynamics of stocks:  There are dynamic equations for the capital stock, the   stock of government debt, and the external debt.   When I was an undergraduate at the London School of Economics (LSE) between   1962 and 1965, we learned the IS-LM model, which combined the aggregate demand   equation (1) with the money market equilibrium condition set out in (3).  That was the   basic understanding of the Keynesian model as crystallized by John Hicks, Franco   Modigliani, and others, in which it was easy to add detail to the demand functions for   private-sector consumption, C; for investment, I; for government spending, G; and for net   exports.  The Keynesian emphasis on aggregate demand and its determinants is one of the   basic innovations of the Keynesian revolution, and one that makes it far easier to   understand and explain what factors are determining output and employment.     Continuing down the list, on price and wage dynamics, the Phillips curve has   flattened somewhat since the 1950s and 1960s.3  Further, the role of expectations of   inflation in the Phillips curve has been developed far beyond what was understood when   A.W. Phillips--who was a New Zealander, an LSE faculty member, and a statistician and                                                     3 See Blanchard (2016).     - 4 -   former engineer--discovered what later became the Phillips curve.  The difference   between the short- and long-run Phillips curves, which is now a staple of textbooks, was   developed by Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps, and the effect of making   expectations rational or model consistent was emphasized by Robert Lucas, whose   islands model provided an imperfect information reason for a nonvertical short-run   Phillips curve.  In Okun’s law, the Okun coefficient--the coefficient specifying how much   a change in the unemployment rate affects output--appears to have declined over time.    So has the trend rate of productivity growth, which is a critical determinant of future   levels of per capita income.     In (3), the monetary equilibrium condition, the monetary policy decision was   typically represented by the money stock at the LSE and perhaps also at the   Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after the Keynesian revolution (after all,   “L” represents the liquidity preference function and “M” the supply of money); now the   money supply rule is replaced by an interest-rate setting rule, for instance a reaction   function of some form, or by a calculated “optimal” policy based on a loss function.     The development of the flexible inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy is   one of the major achievements of modern macroeconomics.  Flexible inflation targeting   allows for flexibility in the speed with which the monetary authority plans on returning to   the target inflation rate, and is thereby close to the dual mandate that the law assigns to   the Fed.     A great deal of progress has been made in developing the credit and financial   intermediation block.  As early as the 1960s, each of James Tobin, Milton Friedman, and   Karl Brunner and Alan Meltzer wrote out models with more fully explicated financial     - 5 -   sectors, based on demand functions for assets other than money.  Later the demand   functions were often replaced by pricing equations derived from the capital asset pricing   model.  Researchers at the Fed have been bold enough to add estimated term and risk   premiums to the determination of the returns on some assets.4  They have concluded,   inter alia, that the arguments we used to make about how easy it would be to measure   expected inflation if the government would introduce inflation-indexed bonds failed to   take into account that returns on bonds are affected by liquidity and risk premiums.  This   means that one of the major benefits that were expected from the introduction of   inflation-indexed bonds (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities, generally called TIPS),   namely that they would provide a quick and reliable measure of inflation expectations,   has not been borne out, and that we still have to struggle to get reasonable estimates of   expected inflation.      As students, we included NX, net exports, in the aggregate demand equation, but   we did not generally solve for the exchange rate, possibly because the exchange rate was   typically fixed.  Later, in 1976, Rudi Dornbusch inaugurated modern international   macroeconomics--and here I’m quoting from a speech by Ken Rogoff--in his famous   overshooting model.5  As globalization of both goods and asset markets intensified over   the next 40 years, the international aspects of trade in goods and assets occupied an   increasingly important role in the economies of virtually all countries, not least the   United States, and in macroeconomics.     At the LSE, we took a course on the British economy from Frank Paish, whose   lectures consisted of a series of charts, accompanied by narrative from the professor.  He                                                     4 See D’Amico, Kim, and Wei (2014).  5 See Dornbusch (1976) and Rogoff (2001).     - 6 -   made a strong impression on me in a lecture in 1963, in which he said, “You see, it (the   balance of payments deficit) goes up and it goes down, and it is clear that we are moving   toward a balance of payments crisis in 1964.”  I waited and I watched, and the crisis   appeared on schedule, as predicted.  But Paish also warned us that forecasting was   difficult, and gave us the advice “Never look back at your forecasts--you may lose your   nerve.”  I pass that wisdom on to those of you who need it.   I remember also my excitement at being told by a friend in a more senior class   about the existence of econometric models of the entire economy.  It was a wonderful   moment.  I understood that economic policy would from then on be easy:  All that was   necessary was to feed the data into the model and work out at what level to set the policy   parameters.  Unfortunately, it hasn’t worked out that way.  On the use of econometric   models, I think often of something Paul Samuelson once said:  “I’d rather have Bob   Solow’s views than the predictions of a model.  But I’d rather have Solow with a model   than without one.”   We learned a lot at the LSE.  But wonderful as it was to be in London, and to   meet people from all over the world for the first time, and to be able to travel to Europe   and even to the Soviet Union with a student group, and to ski for the first time in my life   in Austria, it gradually became clear to me that the center of the academic economics   profession was not in London or Oxford or Cambridge, but in the United States.   There was then the delicate business of applying to graduate school.  There was a   strong Chicago tendency among many of the lecturers at the LSE, but I wanted to go to   MIT.  When asked why, I gave a simple answer:  “Samuelson and Solow.”  Fortunately, I   got into MIT and had the opportunity of getting to know Samuelson and Solow and other     - 7 -   great professors.  And I also met the many outstanding students who were there at the   time, among them Robert Merton.  I took courses from Samuelson and Solow and other   MIT stars, and I wrote my thesis under the guidance of Paul Samuelson and Frank Fisher.    From there, my first job was at the University of Chicago--and I understood that I was   very lucky to have been able to learn from the great economists at both MIT and   Chicago.  Among the many things I learned at Chicago was a Milton Friedman saying:    “Man may not be rational, but he’s a great rationalizer,” which is a quote that often   comes to mind when listening to stock market analysts.     After four years at Chicago, I returned to the MIT Department of Economics, and   thought that I would never leave--even more so when MIT succeeded in persuading Rudi   Dornbusch, whom I had met when he was a student at Chicago, to move to MIT--thus   giving him too the benefit of having learned his economics at both Chicago and MIT, and   giving MIT the pleasure and benefit of having added a superb economist and human   being to the collection of such people already present.   MIT was still heavily involved in developing growth theory at the time I was a   Ph.D. student there, from 1966 to 1969.  We students were made aware of Kaldor’s   stylized facts about the process of growth, presented in his 1957 article “A Model of   Economic Growth.”  They were:   1. The shares of national income received by labor and capital are roughly   constant over long periods of time.   2. The rate of growth of the capital stock per worker is roughly constant over   long periods of time.     - 8 -   3. The rate of growth of output per worker is roughly constant over long periods   of time.   4. The capital/output ratio is roughly constant over long periods of time.   5. The rate of return on investment is roughly constant over long periods of time.   6. The real wage grows over time.   Well, that was then, and many of the problems we face in our economy now relate   to the changes in the stylized facts about the behavior of the economy:  Every one of   Kaldor’s stylized facts is no longer true, and unfortunately the changes are mostly in a   direction that complicates the formulation of economic policy.6     While the basic approach outlined so far remains valid, and can be used to address   many macroeconomic policy issues, I would like briefly to take up several topics in more   detail.  Some of them are issues that have remained central to the macroeconomic agenda   over the past 50 years, some have to my regret fallen off the agenda, and others are new   to the agenda.     1. Inflation and unemployment:  Estimated Phillips curves appear to be flatter   than they were estimated to be many years ago--in terms of the textbooks,   Phillips curves appear to be closer to what used to be called the Keynesian   case (flat Phillips curve) than to the classical case (vertical Phillips curve).    Since the U.S. economy is now below our 2 percent inflation target, and since   unemployment is in the vicinity of full employment, it is sometimes argued   that the link between unemployment and inflation must have been broken.  I   don’t believe that.  Rather the link has never been very strong, but it exists,                                                     6 See Jones and Romer (2010).     - 9 -   and we may well at present be seeing the first stirrings of an increase in the   inflation rate--something that we would like to happen.     2. Productivity and growth:  The rate of productivity growth in the United States   and in much of the world has fallen dramatically in the past 20 years.  The   table shows calculated rates of annual productivity growth for the United   States over three periods:  1952 to 1973; 1974 to 2007; and the most recent   period, 2008 to 2015.  After having been 3 percent and 2.1 percent in the first   two periods, the annual rate of productivity growth has fallen to 1.2 percent in   the period since the start of the global financial crisis.     The right guide to thinking in this case is given by a famous Herbert Stein   line:  “The difference between a growth rate of 1 percent and 2 percent is 100   percent.”  Why?  Productivity growth is a major determinant of long-term   growth.  At a 1 percent growth rate, it takes income 70 years to double.  At a   2 percent growth rate, it takes 35 years to double.  That is to say, that with a   growth rate of 1 percent per capita, it takes two generations for per capita   income to double; at a 2 percent per capita growth rate, it takes one generation   for per capita income to double.  That is a massive difference, one that would   very likely have severe consequences for the national mood, and possibly for   economic policy.  That is to say, there are few issues more important for the   future of our economy, and those of every other country, than the rate of   productivity growth.    At this stage, we simply do not know what will happen to productivity   growth.  Robert Gordon of Northwestern University has just published an     - 10 -   extremely interesting and pessimistic book that argues we will have to accept   the fact that productivity will not grow in future at anything like the rates of   the period before 1973.  Others look around and see impressive changes in   technology and cannot believe that productivity growth will not move back   closer to the higher levels of yesteryear.7  A great deal of work is taking place   to evaluate the data, but so far there is little evidence that data difficulties   account for a significant part of the decline in productivity growth as   calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.8   3. The ZLB and the effectiveness of monetary policy:  From December 2008 to   December 2015, the federal funds rate target set by the Fed was a range of   0 to 1/4 percent, a range of rates that was described as the ZLB (zero lower   bound).9  Between December 2008 and December 2014, the Fed engaged in   QE--quantitative easing--through a variety of programs.  Empirical work done   at the Fed and elsewhere suggests that QE worked in the sense that it reduced   interest rates other than the federal funds rate, and particularly seems to have   succeeded in driving down longer-term rates, which are the rates most   relevant to spending decisions.    Critics have argued that QE has gradually become less effective over the   years, and should no longer be used.  It is extremely difficult to appraise the   effectiveness of a program all of whose parameters have been announced at   the beginning of the program.  But I regard it as significant with respect to the                                                     7 See, for instance, Mokyr, Vickers, and Ziebarth (2015).  8 See Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (forthcoming).    9 Inside the Fed, the range of 0 to ¼ percent is generally called the ELB, the effective lower bound.       - 11 -   effectiveness of QE that the taper tantrum in 2013, apparently caused by a   belief that the Fed was going to wind down its purchases sooner than   expected, had a major effect on interest rates.     More recently, critics have argued that QE, together with negative interest   rates, is no longer effective in either Japan or in the euro zone.  That case has   not yet been empirically established, and I believe that central banks still have   the capacity through QE and other measures to run expansionary monetary   policies, even at the zero lower bound.     4. The monetary-fiscal policy mix:  There was once a great deal of work on the   optimal monetary-fiscal policy mix.  The topic was interesting and the   analysis persuasive.  Nonetheless the subject seems to be disappearing from   the public dialogue; perhaps in ascendance is the notion that--except in   extremis, as in 2009--activist fiscal policy should not be used at all.  Certainly,   it is easier for a central bank to change its policies than for a Treasury or   Finance Ministry to do so, but it remains a pity that the fiscal lever seems to   have been disabled.     5. The financial sector:  Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff’s book, This Time Is   Different, must have been written largely before the start of the great financial   crisis.  I find their evidence that a recession accompanied by a financial crisis   is likely to be much more serious than an ordinary recession persuasive, but   the point remains contentious.  Even in the case of the Great Recession, it is   possible that the U.S. recession got a second wind when the euro-zone crisis   worsened in 2011.  But no one should forget the immensity of the financial     - 12 -   crisis that the U.S. economy and the world went through following the   bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers--and no one should forget that such things   could happen again.     The subsequent tightening of the financial regulatory system under the Dodd-  Frank Act was essential, and the complaints about excessive regulation and   excessive demands for banks to hold capital betray at best a very short   memory.  We, the official sector and particularly the regulatory authorities, do   have an obligation to try to minimize the regulatory and other burdens placed   on the private sector by the official sector--but we have a no less important   obligation to try to prevent another financial crisis.  And we should also   remember that the shadow banking system played an important role in the   propagation of the financial crisis, and endeavor to reduce the riskiness of that   system.   6.   The economy and the price of oil:  For some time, at least since the United   States became an oil importer, it has been believed that a low price of oil is   good for the economy.  So when the price of oil began its descent below   $100 a barrel, we kept looking for an oil-price-cut dividend.  But that dividend   has been hard to discern in the macroeconomic data.  Part of the reason is that   as a result of the rapid expansion of the production of oil from shale, total U.S.   oil production had risen rapidly, and so a larger part of the economy was   adversely affected by the decline in the price of oil.  Another part is that   investment in the equipment and structures needed for shale oil production   had become an important component of aggregate U.S. investment, and that     - 13 -   component began a rapid decline.  For these reasons, although the United   States has remained an oil importer, the decrease in the world price of oil had   a mixed effect on U.S. gross domestic product.  There is reason to believe that   when the price of oil stabilizes, and U.S. shale oil production reaches its new   equilibrium, the overall effect of the decline in the price of oil will be seen to   have had a positive effect on aggregate demand in the United States, since   lower energy prices are providing a noticeable boost to the real incomes of   households.   7. Secular stagnation:  During World War II in the United States, many   economists feared that at the end of the war, the economy would return to   high pre-war levels of unemployment--because with the end of the war,   demobilization, and the massive reduction that would take place in the defense   budget, there would not be enough demand to maintain full employment.     Thus was born or renewed the concept of secular stagnation--the view that the   economy could find itself permanently in a situation of low demand, less than   full employment, and low growth.10  That is not what happened after World   War II, and the thought of secular stagnation was correspondingly laid aside,   in part because of the growing confidence that intelligent economic policies--                                                    10 I am distinguishing in this section between secular stagnation as being caused by a deficiency of  aggregate demand and another view, that output growth will be very slow in future because productivity  growth will be very low.  The view that future productivity growth will be very low has already been  discussed, with the conclusion that we do not have a good basis for predictions of its future level, and that  we simply do not know whether future productivity growth will be extremely low or higher than it has been  recently.  There is no shortage of views on this issue among economists, but the views to some extent  appear to depend on whether the economist making the prediction is an optimist or a pessimist.     - 14 -   fiscal and monetary--could be relied on to help keep the economy at full   employment with a reasonable growth rate.   Recently, Larry Summers has forcefully restated the secular stagnation   hypothesis, and argued that it accounts for the current slowness of economic   growth in the United States and the rest of the industrialized world.  The   theoretical case for secular stagnation in the sense of a shortage of demand is   tied to the question of the level of the interest rate that would be needed to   generate a situation of full employment.  If the equilibrium interest rate is   negative, or very small, the economy is likely to find itself growing slowly,   and frequently encountering the zero lower bound on the interest rate.      Research has shown a declining trend in estimates of the equilibrium interest   rate.  That finding has become more firmly established since the start of the   Great Recession and the global financial crisis.11  Moreover, the level of the   equilibrium interest rate seems likely to rise only gradually to a longer-run   level that would still be quite low by historical standards.     What factors determine the equilibrium interest rate?  Fundamentally, the   balance of saving and investment demands.  Several trends have been cited as   possible factors contributing to a decline in the long-run equilibrium real rate.    One likely factor is persistent weakness in aggregate demand.  Among the   many reasons for that, as Larry Summers has noted, is that the amount of                                                     11 This research includes recent work by Johannsen and Mertens (2015) and Kiley (2015) that uses  extensions of the original Laubach and Williams (2003) framework.  An international perspective on  medium-to-long-run real interest rates is provided by U.S. Executive Office of the President (2015).   Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Hall (2014) discuss the long-lived effects of financial crises on economic  performance.  See also Hamilton and others (2015).  I have, in addition, drawn on Fischer (forthcoming).     - 15 -   physical capital that the revolutionary information technology firms with high   stock market valuations have needed is remarkably small.  The slowdown of   productivity growth, which as already mentioned has been a prominent and   deeply concerning feature of the past six years, is another important factor.12    Others have pointed to demographic trends resulting in there being a larger   share of the population in age cohorts with high saving rates.13  Some have   also pointed to high saving rates in many emerging market countries, coupled   with a lack of suitable domestic investment opportunities in those countries, as   putting downward pressure on rates in advanced economies--the global   savings glut hypothesis advanced by Ben Bernanke and others at the Fed   about a decade ago.14    Whatever the cause, other things being equal, a lower level of the long-run   equilibrium real rate suggests that the frequency and duration of future   episodes in which monetary policy is constrained by the ZLB will be higher   than in the past.  Prior to the crisis, some research suggested that such   episodes were likely to be relatively infrequent and generally short lived.15    The past several years certainly require us to reconsider that basic assumption.     Moreover, recent experience in the United States and other countries has   taught us that conducting monetary policy at the effective lower bound is                                                     12 It is also a major factor explaining the phenomenon of the economy’s impressive performance on the  jobs front during a period of historically slow growth.  13 See, for instance, Gordon (2014, 2016).  14 See Bernanke (2005).  See also the recent work by Caballero, Farhi, and Gourinchas (2008); and  Mendoza, Quadrini, and Rios-Rull (2009).     15 See, for instance, Reifschneider and Williams (2000), Blanchard and Simon (2001), and Stock and  Watson (2003).     - 16 -   challenging.16  And while unconventional policy tools such as forward   guidance and asset purchases have been extremely helpful and effective, all   central banks would prefer a situation with positive interest rates, restoring   their ability to use the more traditional interest rate tool of monetary policy.17     The answer to the question “Will the equilibrium interest rate remain at   today’s low levels permanently?” is also that we do not know.  Many of the   factors that determine the equilibrium interest rate, particularly productivity   growth, are extremely difficult to forecast.  At present, it looks likely that the   equilibrium interest rate will remain low for the policy-relevant future, but   there have in the past been both long swings and short-term changes in what   can be thought of as equilibrium real rates.   Eventually, history will give us the answer.  But it is critical to emphasize that   history’s answer will depend also on future policies, monetary and other,   notably including fiscal policy.     Concluding Remarks   Well, are the answers all different than they were 50 years ago?  No.  The basic   framework we learned a half-century ago remains extremely useful.  But also yes:  Some   of the answers are different because they were not on previous exams because the   problems they deal with were not evident fifty years ago.  So the advice to potential   policymakers is simple:  Learn as much as you can, for most of it will come in useful at                                                     16 For a discussion of various issues reviewed by the Federal Open Market Committee in late 2008 and  2009 regarding the complications of unconventional monetary policy at the ZLB, see the set of staff memos  on the Board’s website at www.federalreserve.gov/foia/fomc/readingrooms.htm.  17 See Williams (2013).     - 17 -   some stage of your career; but never forget that identifying what is happening in the   economy is essential to your ability to do your job, and for that you need to keep your   eyes, your ears, and your mind open, and with regard to your mouth--to use it with   caution.

Woodford, Michael (2010).  “Financial Intermediation and Macroeconomic Analysis,”   Journal of Economic Perspectives, vol. 24 (Fall), pp. 21-44.        - 22 -   Appendix   The following model includes a number of elements that play a central role in the   analysis of economic fluctuations and in larger policy models as I have encountered them   at the Federal Reserve and other institutions.   An aggregate demand relationship, in the form of the investment-saving (or IS)   curve, characterizes the negative dependence of economic activity on the real borrowing   rate, 𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵 − 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 , and the positive dependence on expected output, 𝑦𝑦𝑒𝑒; government spending,   𝐺𝐺; and net exports, NX, as a function of the exchange rate, 𝑒𝑒, and foreign output, 𝑦𝑦𝑓𝑓:     𝑦𝑦 = 𝐴𝐴(𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵 − 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 , 𝑦𝑦𝑒𝑒 ,𝐺𝐺,𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁), 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑤𝑤ℎ  𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 = 𝑓𝑓 �𝑒𝑒𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓  𝑃𝑃 ,𝑦𝑦𝑓𝑓�.           (1)     The Phillips curve describes a relationship between inflation and labor market   slack.  Inflation responds negatively to the level of the unemployment gap, 𝑢𝑢,�  and to   changes in aggregate productivity, 𝑧𝑧 (including shocks to commodity prices).  Current   inflation also responds positively to expected future inflation, 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 , and to the level of the   borrowing rate and of the exchange rate, 𝜙𝜙(𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵, 𝑒𝑒) (cost − push shocks):     𝜋𝜋 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑢𝑢�) − 𝑧𝑧 + 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 + 𝜙𝜙�𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵,  𝑒𝑒�.                           (Phillips curve)    (2)       Current issues regarding the role of expectations, the size of the slope, and the   pass-through from exchange rate movements to domestic prices and wages can be   addressed in this context.  Recent discussions can be found in Blanchard’s (2016)   reference to the back-to-the-1960s thinking about the Phillips curve and in Blanchard,   Cerutti, and Summers’s (2015) thoughts on hysteresis mechanisms underlying the   inflation and unemployment dynamic.     - 23 -   To connect cyclical fluctuations in the level of aggregate activity with changes in   employment, Okun’s law has been proved useful as an empirical description of the   relationship between the output gap and the unemployment gap, 𝑢𝑢� = 𝑢𝑢−𝑢𝑢 ∗  𝑢𝑢∗  (see Knotek   (2007); and Daly, Fernald, Jordà, and Nechio (2013, 2014)):     𝑦𝑦� = −𝛾𝛾𝑢𝑢� .                 (Okun’s law)     (3)       To characterize monetary policy, it is nowadays useful to consider how the central   bank affects the level of interest rates by setting the federal funds rate, 𝑖𝑖, in response to   deviations of expected inflation from its target, 𝜋𝜋� = 𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 − 𝜋𝜋∗ (inflation gap), and percent   deviations of output from its potential level, 𝑦𝑦� = 𝑦𝑦−𝑦𝑦 ∗  𝑦𝑦∗  (output gap):     𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓𝑓�𝜋𝜋𝑒𝑒 − 𝜋𝜋∗,  𝑦𝑦��.                       (4)     To capture the role of credit and financial intermediation in the economy,   consider a loan market equation, where the demand on the left-hand side depends   negatively on the borrowing rate, 𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵, and the level of economic activity (higher income   implies lower financing needs).  The supply of loans depends negatively on the level of   interest rates, 𝑖𝑖, and positively on the level of intermediation spreads, 𝜔𝜔, and income, 𝑦𝑦   (to the extent that higher aggregate income increases deposits and banks’ capitalization   and hence the supplies of intermediated funds).  This equation pins down the equilibrium   level of the intermediation spread,𝜔𝜔:     𝐿𝐿𝑑𝑑(𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵,𝑦𝑦) = 𝐿𝐿𝑠𝑠�𝑖𝑖,𝜔𝜔,  𝑦𝑦�.       (5)    The borrowing rate, 𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵, is then equal to the sum of the risk-free rate set by the   central bank, 𝑖𝑖, and the spread,𝜔𝜔:     - 24 -     𝑖𝑖𝐵𝐵 = 𝑖𝑖 + 𝜔𝜔.        (6)     This analysis is in the spirit of James Tobin’s approach to monetary economics as   was recently described by Solow (2004) and extended by Woodford (2010) to describe   the role for financial intermediation shocks.  It also captures the work by B. Friedman, B.   Bernanke, and A. Blinder in thinking about the role of credit and credit spreads in the   transmission of monetary policy impulses.   Open economy aspects are captured by the following equations:  The balance of   payment is in equilibrium when net exports are compensated by capital flows of opposite   sign.  Capital flows depend on the difference between the domestic interest rate and the   foreign rate adjusted for depreciation:     𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 �𝑒𝑒𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓  𝑃𝑃 ,𝑦𝑦𝑓𝑓�+ 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 �𝑖𝑖 − 𝑖𝑖𝑓𝑓 −  𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒 𝑒𝑒  � = 0.    (7)     Furthermore, the uncovered interest rate parity equates the rate of return on   domestic assets, 𝑖𝑖, to the rate of return on foreign assets, 𝑖𝑖𝑓𝑓 ,  plus future expected changes   in the exchange rate,  𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒 𝑒𝑒  , and a residual risk premium component, 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅:      𝑖𝑖 = 𝑖𝑖𝑓𝑓 +  𝑑𝑑𝑒𝑒 𝑒𝑒   + 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅.                    (8)     For a detailed description of these relationships, see Dornbusch, Fischer, and   Startz (2014); and Obstfeld and Rogoff (1996).
