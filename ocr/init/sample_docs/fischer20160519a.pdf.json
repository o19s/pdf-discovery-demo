  "content": " For release on delivery   9:15 a.m. EDT   May 19, 2016           (Money), Interest and Prices      Remarks by    Stanley Fischer    Vice Chairman    Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System    at    “A Conference in Honor of Michael Woodford’s Contributions to Economics”   cosponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,    Columbia University Program for Economic Research,    and Columbia University Department of Economics    New York, New York          May 19, 2016       It is an honor for me to speak at the opening of this conference in honor of   Michael Woodford, whose contributions to the theory of economic policy are frequently   a central part of the economic analysis that takes place in the policy discussions at the   Federal Reserve.1     The main story I want to tell today is about the quality of Michael’s major book,   Interest and Prices (henceforth MWIP).  I will start with his predecessors, beginning as   Michael does in his Interest and Prices with Wicksell.2 3  I shall quote key points from   and about Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (henceforth KWIP), and following that, from   Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices (second edition, 1965) (henceforth MIP), which   are relevant to MWIP, Michael Woodford’s Interest and Prices (2003).   I. Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (1898)   1. Inflation.  The subtitle of Wicksell’s Interest and Prices (KWIP) is A Study of   the Causes Regulating the Value of Money and its opening paragraph   emphasizes the problem of inflation:      Changes in the general level of prices have always excited great   interest.  Obscure in origin, they exert a profound and far-  reaching influence on the whole economic and social life of a   country.                                                     1 I am grateful to Hess Chung, Rochelle Edge, William English, Michael Kiley, Thomas Laubach, Matthias   Paustian, David Reifschneider, Jeremy Rudd, and Stacey Tevlin of the Federal Reserve Board for their   advice and assistance.  2 Wicksell’s Interest and Prices, published in German in 1898 as Geldzins und Guterpreise by Gustav   Fischer (Jena), was first published in English (translated by R.F. Kahn) by Macmillan & Co. in 1936.  It   was published in the United States by Augustus Kelley in 1965 in the series Reprints of Economic Classics.    3 See Torsten Gardlund (1958), The Life of Knut Wicksell, trans. Nancy Adler (Brookfield, Vt.:  Edward   Elgar).  Wicksell was not only a superb economist but also a remarkably interesting man, whose major   works in economics were published starting in the late 1890s, when he was nearing the age of 50 (he was   born in 1851 and died in 1926).  Much of his earlier work was on Malthus and Malthusianism.  The last   paragraph of the text of Gardlund’s book (p. 330) is about Wicksell’s funeral and reads “Various   associations and academic institutions sent the customary wreaths, but many of Wicksell’s friends and   disciples, honoring a request, instead sent their contributions to the Malthusian Advice Bureau.”     - 2 -   Wicksell follows this opening by discussing the difference between   the ability of the economic system to adjust to changes in relative prices and   to changes in the general level of prices.  In the latter case,    Adjustment can no longer proceed through changes in demand or   through a movement of factors of production from one branch of   production to another.  Its progress is much slower, being   accomplished under continual difficulties, and it is never   complete; so that a residue, either temporary or permanent, of   social maladjustment is always left over.     Wicksell states that both inflation and deflation are evils, but that it   is generally believed that what is most desirable is a situation “in which prices   are rising [italics in original] slowly but steadily” (p.3).  He likens the   arguments for this viewpoint as reminding one “of those who purposely keep   their watches a little fast so as to be more certain of catching their trains”   (p.3).  Rational man that he was, he dismisses such behavior--of which I am   guilty--as not being able to survive in the long run.     And optimist as he must have been, he concludes the opening   chapter of his Interest and Prices by saying that “the prevention of these   troubles by the provision of a constant measure of value cannot, in the present   state of economic development, be regarded a priori as unthinkable” (p.7)   2. The Quantity Theory.  Wicksell’s chapter on the quantity theory is very short.    He states (p.41) that    The Theory provides a real explanation of its subject matter, and   in a manner that is logically incontestable; but only on   assumptions that unfortunately have little relation to practice . . .4                                                       4 He gives several reasons that the assumptions have little relation to practice, including that there is “a kind   of collective holding of balances, arising out of the acceptance by banks of deposits.”     - 3 -   He concludes the chapter (p.50) by saying that   the Quantity Theory cannot just be thrown overboard.  …. It   must be put up with, in the hope that a more intimate analysis of   the underlying facts might remove the blemishes from which it   undoubtedly suffers.   3. The Natural Rate of Interest on Capital and the Rate of Interest on Loans (the   cumulative process).  We come here to a central and famous part of   Wicksell’s contribution to monetary economics and policy:   There is a certain rate of interest on loans which is neutral in   respect to commodity prices, and tends neither to raise nor to   lower them.  This is necessarily the same as the rate of interest   which would be determined by supply and demand if no use   were made of money and all lending were effected in the form of   real capital goods.  It comes to much the same thing to describe it   as the current value of the natural rate of interest on capital.    (p.102)   . . . . . . . . . . .   At any moment … there is a certain level of the average rate of   interest which is such that the general level of prices has no   tendency to move either upwards or downwards.  This we call   the normal rate of interest.  Its magnitude is determined by the   current level of the natural capital rate, and rises and falls with it.    If, for any reason whatever, the average rate of interest is set and   maintained below this normal level, no matter how small the gap,   prices will rise and will go on rising; or if they were already in   process of falling, they will fall more slowly and eventually   begin to rise.    If, on the other hand, the rate of interest is maintained no matter   how little above the current level of the natural rate, prices will   fall continuously and without limit.  (p.120)   4. International Price Relationships.  Wicksell explains in Chapter 10 that while   it would be desirable to subject the theory of policy set out immediately above     - 4 -   to the test of experience, that could easily be done for a closed economy, but   that the only closed economy in the world is the world as a whole--and that   world data were not then available.    He then sets out the specie-flow mechanism, and concludes on that   subject by saying that while this explanation (the specie-flow mechanism)   must be correct, the    international equilibrium of prices is usually restored far more   rapidly and far more directly.  (p.157)     He then goes on to discuss potential reasons for the more rapid   adjustment, the most important of which is that the price pressures on   individual commodities that are imported or exported as a result of changes in   prices in the two countries exert a direct influence--in the direction of   equilibrium--in the prices of individual goods.      5. Actual Price Movements in the Light of the Preceding Theory.  (Chapter 11)    This chapter concludes   The theory must … be regarded for the moment as a mere   hypothesis, the complete validity of which can be established   only by further resort to the facts of experience.   . . . . . . . . . . .   My purpose is to lay down the theoretical principles which   underlie these phenomena, and once they are correctly   understood their application can be confidently left to the   experience and insight of practical men.  (pp. 176-7)   6. Practical Proposals for the Stabilisation of the Value of Money.  (Chapter 12).    This chapter starts with a discussion of bimetallism, on which Gardlund   (p. 274) quotes Wicksell as having written in a letter that he was “neither a     - 5 -   mono- nor a bimetallist, but a non-metallist.”  Wicksell then proceeds to   suggest a reaction function for the central bank:   According to our line of approach, they [proposals for stabilizing   the value of money] can attain their objective only in so far as   they exert an indirect influence on the money rate of interest, and   bring it into line with the natural rate . . . (p.188)   But    This does not mean that the [central] banks ought actually to   ascertain the natural rate before fixing their own rates of interest.   . . . The procedure should rather be simply as follows: So long as   prices remain unaltered, the banks’ rate of interest is to remain   unaltered.  If prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised. . . .   and likewise mutatis mutandis if the price level falls.  (p.189)   To make this possible, Wicksell suggests the suspension of the free   coinage of gold, as a “first step towards the introduction of an ideal standard   of value”--“an international paper standard” (p.193).  And, on a soaring   personal note at the end of the formal text of the book (p.196), he writes   the question of monetary reform on international lines definitely   remains among the most important of economic problems.  That   its realization depends on international co-operation . . . is to my   mind a positive recommendation.  I joyfully welcome every fresh   step towards the uniting of nations for economic or scientific   ends, for it adds one more safeguard for the preservation and   strengthening of that good on which the successful attainment of   all other goods, both material and immaterial, ultimately   depends--international peace.   If this were a paper about Wicksell, there would be no choice but to   stop after this inspiring crescendo.  But although Wicksell plays a key role in   this paper, the paper is not primarily about him.  Let me nonetheless conclude   this section of the paper with a few additional comments.       - 6 -   7. Wicksell’s explanation of price dynamics.  (continuation of #1 above)   Now let us suppose that for some reason or other commodity   prices rise while the stock of money remains unchanged, or that   the stock of money is diminished while prices remain   temporarily unchanged.  The cash balances will gradually appear   to be too small in relation to the new level of prices. . . . I   therefore seek to enlarge my balance.  This can only be done--  neglecting for the present the possibility of borrowing, etc.--  through a reduction in my demand for goods and services, or   through an increase in the supply of my own commodity . . . or   though both together.  The same is true of all other owners and   consumers of commodities.  But in fact nobody will succeed in   realizing the object at which each is aiming--to increase his cash   balance. . . . On the other hand, the universal reduction in   demand and increase in supply of commodities will necessarily   bring about a continuous fall in all prices. This can only cease   when prices have fallen to the level at which the cash balances   are regarded as adequate. . . .  (pp. 39-40)   8. Paul Samuelson on Wicksell.  In 1962 Paul Samuelson delivered the Wicksell   Lectures in Sweden, and opened with a lecture on “Wicksell, The   Economist”.5  Herewith three extracts from his lecture:    A stormy rebel against the traditional religion and prudery of his   day, Wicksell had the warm heart of a socialist along with the   cool head of a classical economist.  (pp. 1682-3);    . . . Wicksell spent part of his time as professor at Lund in jail.    Whatever we may think of the state of society then, which could   jail a man for the offense of blasphemy, one’s admiration goes   out to the tradition of academic freedom in Swedish Universities,   which keeps a professor’s livelihood and scholarly privileges   immune from his non-scholarly misdemeanors. (p.1684);                                                      5 See Joseph E. Stiglitz, ed. (1966-2011), The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul Samuelson, vol. II   (Cambridge, Mass.:  MIT Press), pp. 1682-92.       - 7 -   And here comes the essence of Samuelson’s evaluation of his great   predecessor:   Because Wicksell read the works of his predecessors and   contemporaries, and acknowledged the fact; because he was   eclectic; because he regarded all his own ideas as merely   tentative hypotheses; because he happened to come to economics   after Jevons, Menger, Walras, Bohm-Bawerk, Marshall and J.B.   Clark--for all these reasons Wicksell is sometimes regarded as   not having been a truly original and creative economist.  I am   convinced this appraisal is quite wrong.    While Wicksell may have lacked the broad judgment of Marshall   and one-track concentration of Clark, to savor his genius you   have merely to read his works on capital and general equilibrium   (vide Joan Robinson); on marginal productivity (vide Solow); on   the impact of technological change (vide Hicks); on marginal   cost pricing and imperfect competition (vide Hotelling and   Chamberlin); on business cycle rhythms generated by uneven   exogenous trends and random shocks of innovation, which   impinge on an endogenous system geared to produce quasi-  regular rhythms whose periods depend on its internal structure   (vide Frisch and Tinbergen); on the proper role of government   expenditure in an affluent and less-than-affluent society (vide   Lindahl and Musgrave); [and] on the relationship between   interest rates set by central banks and cumulative trends of   inflation or deflation.  (p.1688)   What Samuelson saw in 1962 had gradually become the accepted   view of Wicksell in the English-speaking world after the translation of both   Interest and Prices and the two volumes of his Lectures on Political   Economy6 in the 1930s.                                                       6 See Knut Wicksell (1935), Lectures in Political Economy, vol. I:  General Theory and vol II:  Money   (London:  George Routledge and Sons); reprinted in 1967 (Fairfield, N.J.:  Augustus M. Kelley).       - 8 -   And the references by Samuelson to the many topics on which   Wicksell made important contributions should remind us that Wicksell’s   Interest and Prices was but one of his major contributions, and that Volume II   of his Lectures on Political Economy is about money, banking and credit.   9. Wicksell and Inside Money.  In both his Interest and Prices and Volume II of   his Lectures, Wicksell discusses the possibility of a pure inside money   economy.  His conclusion is stated with his usual clarity:   Only by completely divorcing the value of money from … its   commodity function, by abolishing all free minting, and by   making the minted coin or banknotes proper, or more generally   the unit employed in the accounts of the credit institutions, both   the medium of exchange and the measure of value, only in this   way can the contradiction be overcome and the imperfection be   remedied.  It is only in this way that a logically coherent credit   system, combining both economy of monetary media and   stability in the standard of value, becomes in any way   conceivable.     II. Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices (first edition, 1956; second edition, 1965)7   In discussing Patinkin’s work, I need to mention that I was his research assistant   when he visited MIT in about 1967-8, and that I was an admirer of his work and of his   reputation as the founder of modern Israeli economics, and that later I became his friend,   albeit a junior among friends.  Now I turn to his major work.   1. The goal of MIP.  The subtitle of MIP is An Integration of Monetary and   Value Theory.  Its goal was thus more theoretical than the goals of either of   the Interest and Prices volumes.  The need for such an integration was based                                                     7 The first edition of Money, Interest, and Prices was published in 1956 by Row, Peterson (Evanston, Ill.);   the second edition in 1965 by Harper & Row (New York).     - 9 -   on the view, frequently expressed by graduate students, that the field of   macroeconomics was based on ad hoc assumptions rather than being derived   from first principles, as is done in value theory--that is, microeconomics.      The first paragraph of the introduction to both editions of MIP is    Money buys goods, and goods do not buy money. The natural   place, then, to study the workings of monetary forces is directly   in the market for goods.  This will be our central theme.   2. The real balance effect.  MIP builds the integration of monetary and value   theory around the real balance effect, often known as the Pigou effect, the   presence of a wealth effect in aggregate demand, which produces stable price   dynamics at the level of the aggregate economy.  The first edition was   published in 1956 and became very well known, but was also criticized,   particularly about the dynamics of prices in response to changes in the money   stock.  The second edition, published in 1965, responded to this and other   critiques, and achieved the goal set out in the book’s subtitle.   In Note M of MIP (pp. 651-664) Patinkin reviews empirical   investigations of the real-balance effect, noting that most of the studies are in   effect estimates of the impact of liquid wealth holdings, rather than just real   balances, on consumption.   3. Reviews of the book.  In an article published in 1993 in a festschrift for   Patinkin8, I reviewed both editions of MIP.   The book had been reviewed by                                                     8 See Stanley Fischer (1993), “Money, Interest, and Prices” in Haim Barkai, Stanley Fischer, and Nissan   Liviatan, eds., Monetary Theory and Thought:  Essays in Honour of Don Patinkin (London:  Palgrave   Macmillan).     - 10 -   at least twelve reviewers, whose verdicts were largely favorable, with almost   all recognizing that they were dealing with a major work.     4. Supplementary Notes.  MIP includes excellent “Supplementary Notes and   Studies in the Literature” including on the work of Walras (Notes B and C),   Wicksell (Note E), of whom like almost all who studied him became admirers,   on Newcomb, Fisher and the Transactions Approach to the Quantity Theory   (Note F), Marshall, Pigou and the Cambridge Cash-Balance Approach (Note   G), Monetary Aspects of the Casselian System (Note H), The Classical and   Neoclassical Theory of Money and Interest (Note J), and Keynes’ General   Theory (Note K).  In his review of MIP, Kenneth Arrow9 described the   literature notes as “sparkling”--not a word frequently used in such a context.   5. Harry Johnson’s comments.  In his 1962 review article on recent work on   monetary theory and policy,10 Harry Johnson devoted almost a quarter of the   review to MIP, which he described as “monumentally scholarly”, but argued   that its analysis of the real balance effect was “conceptually inadequate and   crucially incomplete”.11    Johnson (1962) argued further that   . . . the more elegant approach to monetary theory lies along   inside-money rather than outside-money lines, and that the   foundation of the theory of monetary equilibrium and stability   should be the substitution effect rather than the . . . wealth effect   of a change in real balances.                                                     9 See Kenneth J. Arrow (1957), “Review of Money, Interest, and Prices,” Mathematical Reviews, vol. 18   (September).  10 See Harry G. Johnson (1962), “Monetary Theory and Policy,” American Economic Review, vol. 52   (June), pp. 335-84.  11 As noted in my 1993 article, I did not find that criticism compelling.       - 11 -   Possibly Johnson was thinking of the central bank having to operate   via open-market operations, through exchanges of assets, which would induce   substitution effects, rather than through the printing of money, which in the   first instance produced increases in real balances, which would produce   wealth effects, but which are typically fiscal rather than monetary actions.   6. Involuntary unemployment.  Chapters 13 and 14 of MIP deal with the   consumption function when unemployment takes the household off its labor   supply curve, and with other interactions between markets.  They are based on   research by Leijonhufvud and Clower, and do an excellent job of clarifying   the implications of disequilibrium in one market for behavior in other markets.    This approach was developed further by Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman   in their 1976 volume, Money, Employment, and Inflation, but began to go out   of use and fashion in the 1980s.12   7. Surprising omissions.  MIP definitely achieves its goal of integrating   monetary and value theory, but shows signs of its age in two omissions: first,   that expectations are not emphasized and indeed barely discussed; and second,   there is no analysis in MIP of ongoing inflation--the latter omission being   particularly striking given Israel’s inflationary history.                                                      12 See Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman (1976), Money, Employment and Inflation (New York:   Cambridge University Press).       - 12 -   III Michael Woodford’s Interest and Prices (2003)   Now we come to modern times, to Michael Woodford’s 2003 magnum opus,   Interest and Prices.  Many of the results that appear in the book were developed and   published earlier, for Michael has been a creative and insightful researcher from the start   of his career.  But in the interests of time, I will start with the book.  And since the book   is massive and comprehensive, I will focus on just a few topics of interest selected from   it.  I also add discussion of Michael’s views on quantitative easing and forward guidance-  -topics that would have received far more attention in MWIP if it had been written a   decade later than it was.  And let me note explicitly that Michael has continued to be   remarkably productive, and that the topics I focus on below are among those best known   by modern macroeconomists, but that there is far more to be learned from reading   Michael’s work than I am able to discuss today.   1. The Structure of MWIP.  Interest and Prices (MWIP) is divided into two   parts.  Part I, Analytic Framework, is essentially an advanced textbook on   modern macro models and some of their monetary policy implications, which   introduces the reader to both useful techniques of analysis and recurrent and   important issues in the field.  Its chapter headings are: Price-Level   Determination under Interest Rate Rules; Optimizing Models with Nominal   Rigidities; A Neo-Wicksellian Framework for the Analysis of Monetary   Policy; and Dynamics of the Response to Monetary Policy.  Part II, Optimal   Policy, is more directly policy-focused, with chapter headings: Inflation   Stabilization and Welfare; Gains from Commitment to a Policy Rule; and   finally, Optimal Monetary Policy Rules.     - 13 -   2. The basic model.  MWIP is innovative and impressive.  In almost every   analysis, it uses a small DSGE model, with variations in assumptions to deal   with the topic in hand.  Here follows a typical three equation model,   consisting of log-linear approximations of the non-linear equilibrium   conditions of an underlying model that includes an intertemporal Euler   equation, a New Keynesian Phillips curve, and an interest rate rule.13   𝑥𝑡 = 𝐸𝑡 𝑥𝑡+1 −  𝜎(𝑖̂𝑡 − 𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1 −  �̂�𝑡 𝑛)                                              (1)   𝜋𝑡 =  𝜅𝑥𝑡 + 𝛽𝐸𝑡𝜋𝑡+1                                                                         (2)   𝑖̂𝑡 = 𝑖�̅� + 𝜙𝜋(𝜋𝑡 − �̅�) + 𝜙𝑥(𝑥𝑡 − �̅�)/4                                              (3)   where   𝑥𝑡 is the output gap, �̂�𝑡 − �̂�𝑡 𝑛;   �̂�𝑡 𝑛 is an exogenous variable, representing variations in the natural rate of   output;   𝜋𝑡 is the rate of inflation;   𝑖̂𝑡 is the interest rate;   𝑖�̅� is an exogenous, possibly time-varying, intercept of the Taylor Rule.   3. Analyzing Monetary Policy without Money.  One of Woodford’s most   interesting results is that it is often possible to study monetary policy without   having money in the model.  In these cases, monetary policy is conducted   using the interest rate as the monetary policy instrument.  As Woodford notes   in Chapter 4, “A Neo-Wicksellian Framework”, a money demand equation                                                     13 These are equations (1.12), (1.13), and (1.14), respectively, in chapter 4, which appear on page 246 of   MWIP, the derivation of which is discussed on pp. 243-45.     - 14 -   can under some circumstances be added to the model, with the amount of   money supplied by the central bank having to be consistent with the money   demand equation.  But inflation in such a situation is not necessarily caused   by the quantity of money; rather the quantity of money may be caused by and   consistent with the inflation rate resulting from the three basic equations in   which the money stock does not appear--in particular from the gap between   the natural and actual rates of interest.  For this result to go through, the   money stock cannot per se be among the variables that determine the   equilibrium of the remaining--the non-monetary--part of the model.  This   means that the separation result is not possible if there is a real balance effect   operating in the goods markets.  Or to put the result differently, the separation   feature is consistent with an inside money monetary system, while it may well   not be consistent with an outside money structure.  It is thus consistent with   the suggestion by Harry Johnson mentioned above, that monetary analysis   might better be carried out primarily in an inside-money than an outside-  money model.   This neo-Wicksellian result is somewhat surprising.  It provides   justification for the behavior of those central banks that think and talk of   monetary policy purely in terms of the policy interest rate and other financial   return variables, but not of the money stock.  However, we need to remind   ourselves that it is built on an assumption that the money stock per se does not     - 15 -   appear in the basic three-equation model--and that is an assumption, not a   theorem.14   4. The Goals of Policy.  When he turns to optimal policy, Woodford starts   Chapter 6 by asking what the goals of monetary policy should be.  He states   that there is a fair amount of consensus in the literature that a desirable   monetary policy is one that achieves a low expected value of an objective   function that includes inflation and “some measure of output relative to   potential.”   He then goes on to point out the many questions such a   formulation leaves unanswered, including whether to target the price level or   the inflation rate, should greater priority be given to reducing the variability of   unforecastable inflation, should one seek to stabilize output deviations from a   smooth trend or from the short-run aggregate supply curve, and so forth?  And   then the surprising comment (p.382)    The aim of the present chapter is to show how economic analysis   can be brought to bear upon these questions.     This sounds simple but it is not, for the explanation that Woodford provides is   that    we have seen that models founded on individual optimization   can be constructed that, thanks to the presence of nominal   rigidities, allow for realistic effects of monetary policy upon real   variables.  Here we shall see those same nominal rigidities   provide welfare-economic justification for central bankers’   traditional concern for price stability.                                                       14 It is worth noting that the money stock dropped out of many models in the 1980s because standard   relationships between money and real variables became unstable and because money aggregates became   difficult to control.  Or, as Gerald Bouey, former governor of the Bank of Canada, once said to the House   of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, Trade and Economic Affairs, “We did not abandon M1, M1   abandoned us.”     - 16 -   That is not a simple thought, but it is logical--and that insight enables Michael   to derive a utility or loss function with inflation in it.     Interestingly, Woodford recognizes that his result is based on several   approximations (pp. 383-392), but is nonetheless prepared to go ahead.  While   that choice is to some extent a matter of taste, it is also highly pragmatic--and   some might say, a reflection of his MIT training, a comment that I would take   as a compliment.     5. The importance of the long-term interest rate.  Another key result is that when   you solve forward the system above, you find, as Woodford notes (p.244), that    aggregate demand in this model depends upon all expected   future short real rates, and not simply upon a current ex ante   short real rate of return; and unless fluctuations in short rates are   both highly unforecastable and highly transitory, expectations of   future short rates are more significant than the current short rate     --and in a footnote he notes that this can also be explained by saying that it is   the long rate of interest and not the short rate that determines aggregate   demand in this model.   6.   What to do at the ZLB, Forward Guidance, The Role of Expectations.  MWIP   was completed well before the Fed had to contend with the ZLB--zero lower   bound--which later became the ELB--effective lower bound--even though   there were discussions in the U.S. economy in 2003 and earlier about what to   do if the economy were ever to be at the ZLB.15                                                       15 See Michael Woodford (2012), “Methods of Policy Accommodation at the Interest-Rate Lower Bound,”   in Proceedings--Economic Policy Symposium--Jackson Hole (Kansas City:  Federal Reserve Bank of   Kansas City), pp. 185-288.     - 17 -   Woodford’s views on forward guidance can be understood from the   discussion above of the forward solution of the basic model.  Woodford has   long emphasized the importance of policy commitment, even in the absence of   a binding ZLB constraint.  At the ZLB, explicit forward guidance can   potentially offset a lot of the distortion, by, in effect, reducing all interest rates   across the maturity spectrum at least up to the time that policy changes.    Indeed, as shown by Eggertson and Woodford (2003), optimal forward   guidance should commit to maintain lower interest rates during the recovery   than would otherwise have been warranted by economic conditions. 16    Importantly, the appropriate commitment can be framed as a history-  dependent policy function responding only to the history of the price level and   the output gap, in such a way that the impact on policy decisions of economic   conditions at the lower bound continue, even as the economy recovers.      A history-dependent policy rule introduces a wedge between what   the central bank has promised and what contemporary circumstances, taken by   themselves, would call for.  This wedge may raise difficult questions   regarding the credibility of the policy.  Woodford believes that credibility can   be enhanced by spelling out an explicit framework describing the nature of   any history-dependence.  For example, as Woodford suggests in his 2012   Kansas City Fed paper,    A more useful form of forward guidance, I believe, would be one   that emphasizes the target criterion that will be used to determine   when it is appropriate to raise the federal funds rate target above                                                     16 See Gauti B. Eggertsson and Michael Woodford (2003), “The Zero Bound on Interest Rates and Optimal   Monetary Policy,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, no. 1, pp. 139-211.       - 18 -   its current level, rather than estimates of the “lift-off” date.  If   such an explicit criterion made it clear that short-term interest   rates will not immediately be increased as soon as a Taylor rule   descriptive of past behavior would justify a funds rate above 25   basis points, this would provide a reason for market participants   to expect easier future monetary and financial conditions than   they may currently be anticipating . . .   The very powerful effects of forward guidance have been called “the   forward guidance puzzle”.  But the puzzle is not a deep one, for the ability of   any central bank to commit to follow a particular monetary policy rule must   be a diminishing function of the length of the horizon that is being considered.     This fact serves to limit the extent to which policy can deliberately shape   private expectations.  However, the strength of forward guidance is just one   manifestation of a very high interest elasticity in the DSGE models typically   used by Woodford that shows up pervasively.  For example, any combination   of shocks that brings the economy to the ZLB for an appreciable length of   time will display the effects of the elevated interest elasticity in such models,   whether or not the central bank is assumed to issue explicit forward guidance.    This high elasticity is also in evidence in attempts to evaluate alternative   monetary policy regimes.17   7.   What to do at the Lower Bound, Quantitative Easing.  Woodford is much less   impressed by the potential power of quantitative easing (or “targeted asset   purchases” as he describes them in his Jackson Hole paper).  He argues that   portfolio balance effects do not exist in a modern, general-equilibrium theory                                                     17 I am grateful to Hess Chung of the Federal Reserve Board for drawing to my attention the general point   made in this paragraph.     - 19 -   of asset prices, and that it does not matter whether a particular risk is held in   the portfolio of private investors or the central bank, for in the end the gains or   losses of the central bank are transferred to the government, and via the   government budget constraint, are returned to private individuals.  This is   Ricardian equivalence in a slightly different context than examined by Robert   Barro.18     Whether it applies in practice is an empirical issue, with empirical   evidence from many papers written in the Fed and elsewhere suggesting a   significant impact in the expected direction from quantitative easing actions   undertaken by the Fed and other central banks.19   8. Money Supply versus Interest Rate.  At present, the Neo-Wicksellian approach   developed by Woodford and others is dominant, relative to the explicitly   monetary approach to monetary policy used by Patinkin and others.  I suspect   this situation will continue.  But I believe that we need to consider both   approaches to monetary policy, for monetary policy affects the economy not   only through the Euler equation as in Woodford, but also through direct   effects on current demands for goods described by Patinkin’s use of the real-  balance effect and by Wicksell’s explanation of price dynamics described   earlier.   9. The fundamental impact of Michael Woodford on Fed thinking:20 The most   direct impact of Woodford on Fed thinking and analysis comes from his neo-  Wicksellian analysis of monetary policy.  Essentially, Woodford has                                                     18 See Robert J. Barro (1974), “Are Government Bonds Net Wealth?” Journal of Political Economy, vol. 82   (November-December), pp. 1095-1117.  19 See Joseph E. Gagnon (2016), “Quantitative Easing:  An Underappreciated Success,” Policy   Brief PB 16-4 (Washington:  Peterson Institute for International Economics, April),   https://piie.com/system/files/documents/pb16-4.pdf.  20 I draw here on notes provided by Michael Kiley of the Federal Reserve Board.     - 20 -   developed the links between fluctuations of output and inflation around their   natural21 or long-run equilibrium values and economic welfare--a point22   made clear by the discussion above of his analysis of the optimal goals of   monetary policy.     Many Fed researchers--among them more than a dozen Woodford   students--have attempted to measure the natural rates of interest and the   natural output gap.  Early work on these topics using DSGE models produced   very volatile estimates of these concepts, leading to the development of DSGE   models with more realistic features, including important roles for financial   frictions, which fit the data better--and which bear some resemblance to more   traditional estimates of the output gap.  As a result, these models are now   routinely used in monetary policy discussions.   One key lesson from these models is that measuring the natural rate   of interest or the output gap is hard.  However, estimates of the natural rate of   interest from a collection of structural models across the Federal Reserve   System indicate that the natural rate fell considerably during the financial   crisis, became quite negative in its aftermath, and has subsequently recovered   only slowly.23                                                       21 In Woodford’s and Wicksell’s analyses, natural values are those that would prevail in the absence of   nominal rigidities.  22 See, for example, Katharine Neiss and Edward Nelson (2002), “Inflation Dynamics, Marginal Cost, and   the Output Gap:  Evidence from Three Countries,” unpublished paper, Bank of England, July; Rochelle   Edge, Michael Kiley, and Jean-Philippe Laforte (2008), “Natural Rate Measures in an estimated DSGE   model of the U.S. economy,” Journal of Economic Dynamics and Control, vol. 32, pp. 2512-35.    23 See, for example, figure 1 in Janet Yellen (2015), “The Economic Outlook and Monetary Policy,” speech   delivered at the Economic Club of Washington, Washington, D.C., December 2,    www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/yellen20151202a.pdf.     - 21 -   While estimates of the natural rate from DSGE models provide some   information needed for the proper conduct of monetary policy, these estimates   are closely tied to the structure of the DSGE models, and essentially ignore   the possibility of long-term structural changes in the balance between saving   and investment.  As a result, an alternative longer-run concept, the equilibrium   rate of interest, has also played an important role in recent policy discussions.    Estimates of this concept, which follow a statistical approach introduced by   Thomas Laubach and John Williams24, have also fallen to quite low levels.   A priority for researchers in the field is to develop improved   estimates of the long-run equilibrium interest rate, and to develop policies that   can influence it.  In that regard, one should recognize that in a more complete   model than the basic three equation model laid out above, the natural and   long-run equilibrium interest rates would be functions of many variables,   among them fiscal variables--with respect to both infrastructure spending and   taxation.  In particular, faster trend growth would increase the long-run   equilibrium interest rate, and what we need most, now that we are near full   employment and approaching our target inflation rate, is faster potential   growth.  The neo-Wicksellian and Woodfordian approach to macroeconomics   is well suited also to study that problem, which is critical to the future of the   United States and global economies.                                                      24 See Thomas Laubach and John Williams (2003), “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of   Economics and Statistics, vol. 85, pp. 305-25.    Stanley Fischer  (Money), Interest and Prices  Vice Chairman Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  May 19, 2016   May 19, 2016 2  Inflation    The subtitle of Wicksell’s Interest and Prices is A   Study of the Causes Regulating the Value of   Money.  Its opening paragraph emphasizes the   problem of inflation:     “Changes in the general level of prices   have always excited great interest.    Obscure in origin, they exert a profound   and far-reaching influence on the whole   economic and social life of a country.”   The Natural Rate of Interest on Capital and   Rate of Interest on Loans  “At any moment … there is a certain level of the average rate of interest   which is such that the general level of prices has no tendency to move   either upwards or downwards.  This we call the normal rate of interest.    Its magnitude is determined by the current level of the natural capital rate,   and rises and falls with it.  If, for any reason whatever, the average rate of interest is set and   maintained below this normal level, no matter how small the gap, prices   will rise and will go on rising; or if they were already in process of falling,   they will fall more slowly and eventually begin to rise.  If, on the other hand, the rate of interest is maintained no matter how little   above the current level of the natural rate, prices will fall continuously and   without limit.” (p.120)  May 19, 2016 3   May 19, 2016 4  Actual Price Movements in the Light of the   Preceding Theory  “The theory must … be regarded for the moment as a mere  hypothesis, the complete validity of which can be   established only by further resort to the facts of experience.  ……………  My purpose is to lay down the theoretical principles which   underlie these phenomena, and once they are correctly   understood their application can be confidently left to the   experience and insight of practical men” (pp. 176-7)   May 19, 2016 5  Practical Proposals for the Stabilisation of the   Value of Money  “According to our line of approach, they [proposals for stabilizing the   value of money] can attain their objective only in so far as they exert   an indirect influence on the money rate of interest, and bring it into line   with the natural rate …” (p.188)  But “This does not mean that the [central] banks ought actually to   ascertain the natural rate before fixing their own rates of interest.  …..   The procedure should rather be simply as follows: So long as prices   remain unaltered, the banks’ rate of interest is to remain unaltered.  If   prices rise, the rate of interest is to be raised …… “ and likewise   mutatis mutandis if the price level falls.  (p.189)   May 19, 2016 6  Paul Samuelson on Wicksell  “Because Wicksell read the works of his predecessors and contemporaries, and   acknowledged the fact; because he was eclectic; because he regarded all his own ideas   as merely tentative hypotheses; because he happened to come to economics after Jevons,   Menger, Walras, Bohm-Bawerk, Marshall and J.B. Clark – for all these reasons Wicksell  is sometimes regarded as not having been a truly original and creative economist.  I am   convinced this appraisal is quite wrong.  While Wicksell may have lacked the broad judgment of Marshall and one-track   concentration of Clark, to savor his genius you have merely to read his works on capital   and general equilibrium (vide Joan Robinson); on marginal productivity (vide Solow);   on the impact of technological change (vide Hicks); on marginal cost pricing and   imperfect competition (vide Hotelling and Chamberlin); on business cycle rhythms   generated by uneven exogenous trends and random shocks of innovation, which impinge   on an endogenous system geared to produce quasi-regular rhythms whose periods   depend on its internal structure (vide Frisch and Tinbergen); on the proper role of   government expenditure in an affluent and less-than-affluent society (vide Lindahl and   Musgrave); [and] on the relationship between interest rates set by central banks and   cumulative trends of inflation or deflation.” (p.1688).   May 19, 2016 7  Wicksell and Inside Money  “Only by completely divorcing the value of money from … its commodity   function, by abolishing all free minting, and by making the minted coin   or banknotes proper, or more generally the unit employed in the   accounts of the credit institutions, both the medium of exchange and   the measure of value, only in this way can the contradiction be   overcome and the imperfection be remedied.  It is only in this way that   a logically coherent credit system, combining both economy of   monetary media and stability in the standard of value, becomes in any   way conceivable.”     May 19, 2016 8  Patinkin’s Money, Interest, and Prices  The Real Balance Effect  Money, Interest, and Prices builds the integration of   monetary and value theory around the real balance effect,   often known as the Pigou effect, the presence of a wealth   effect in aggregate demand, which produces a stable   aggregate price dynamics at the level of the economy.    May 19, 2016 9  Harry Johnson’s Comments  “…. the more elegant approach to monetary theory lies along   inside-money rather than outside-money lines, and … the   foundation of the theory of monetary equilibrium and   stability should be the substitution effect rather than the …   wealth effect of a change in real balances.”   May 19, 2016 10  Involuntary Unemployment  Chapters 13 and 14 of MIP deal with the consumption   function when unemployment takes the household off its   labor supply curve, and with other interactions between   markets.  They are based on research by Leijonhufvud and   Clower, and do an excellent job of clarifying the   implications of disequilibrium in one market for behavior   in other markets.  This approach was developed further by   Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman in their 1976   volume, Money, Employment, and Inflation, but began to   go out of use and fashion in the 1980s.
