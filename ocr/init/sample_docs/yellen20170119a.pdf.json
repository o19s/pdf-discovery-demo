  "content": " For release on delivery  8:00 p.m. EST (5:00 p.m. PST)  January 19, 2017      The Economic Outlook and the Conduct of Monetary Policy          Remarks by     Janet L. Yellen      Chair      Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System     at     Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research      Stanford University     Stanford, California          January 19, 2017    It is a privilege to be here today to discuss how the Federal Reserve is conducting   monetary policy to promote a healthy economy.  For more than 30 years, research from   the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research has informed economic policy, and   events such as this one have helped foster debate among scholars, policymakers, business   leaders, and members of the public on critical economic issues facing our nation.  I   appreciate the opportunity to participate.     In my remarks today, I will review the considerable progress the economy has   made toward the attainment of the two objectives that the Congress has assigned to the   Federal Reserve--maximum employment and price stability.  The upshot is that labor   utilization is close to its estimated longer-run normal level, and we are closing in on our   2 percent inflation objective.  I will then discuss the prospects for adjusting monetary   policy in the manner needed to sustain a strong job market while maintaining low and   stable inflation.  Determining how best to adjust the federal funds rate over time to   achieve these objectives will not be easy.  For that reason, in the balance of my remarks, I   will discuss some considerations that will help inform our decisions, including the   guidance provided by simple policy rules.  I will conclude by touching on some key   uncertainties affecting the outlook.     Progress to Date   My assessment of progress to date will begin with the labor market.  Since the   depths of the Great Recession, about 15-1/2 million jobs have been added to the U.S.   economy, on net.  In 2016, job gains averaged about 180,000 per month, well above the   pace of 75,000 to 125,000 per month that is probably consistent with keeping the    - 2 -     unemployment rate stable over the longer run.1  The unemployment rate is now close to   estimates of its longer-run normal level, and other measures of labor utilization have   improved appreciably.  As shown in figure 1, a broader measure of labor   underutilization--the U-6 measure, which includes not only the unemployed but also   people working part time who would like full-time employment and those who would   like a job but are not actively looking--has retraced nearly all of the steep run-up that   occurred as a result of the recession.2    Other indicators also support the view that the labor market has largely recovered   from the severe downturn that occurred in the wake of the financial crisis.  As illustrated   by the red dashed line in figure 2, the quits rate--an indicator of workers’ confidence   about leaving an existing job to pursue new opportunities--is nearly back to its pre-  recession level.  And some indicators, such as small businesses’ assessments of the   difficulty of hiring, shown by the solid black line, as well as the average length of time it   takes firms to fill vacancies and the job openings rate, even suggest that the labor market   is a bit tighter than before the financial crisis.  Of course, both the labor force   participation rate and the employment-to-population ratio are still much lower than they   were a decade ago.  But the cyclical element in these declines looks to have largely   disappeared, and what is left seems to mostly reflect the aging of the population and other   secular trends.3  Based on this array of labor market indicators, I judge labor utilization to   be reasonably close to its normal longer-run level while also recognizing that estimates of                                                               1 The sustainable longer-run pace of payroll employment growth depends on a number of a factors, such as  the growth rate of the working-age population, trend movements in labor force participation, and the  prevalence of self-employment and multiple job holdings, so it cannot be predicted with precision.  2 The normal level of the U-6 measure may now be somewhat higher than it was prior to the financial crisis  because of a trend toward greater reliance on part-time workers in many sectors.  See Golden (2016).  3 See Aaronson and others (2014).    - 3 -     the sustainable levels of the unemployment rate and the employment-to-population ratio   are inherently imprecise.4     In the coming months, I expect some further strengthening in labor market   conditions as the economy continues to expand at a moderate pace--a view that is shared   by most of my colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).5  Overall   economic growth has been driven by consumer spending, which has been bolstered by   substantial gains in household income and wealth.  Business investment, in contrast, has   been soft.  But recent readings on business sentiment and new orders for equipment are   consistent with the view that capital spending will likely strengthen modestly this year;   another positive factor is that oil drilling, which plummeted after oil prices fell sharply   back in late 2014, has recently begun to pick up.  As we look to broader trends, gross   domestic product (GDP) growth has been restrained in recent years by a variety of forces   depressing both supply and demand, including slow labor force and productivity growth,   weak growth abroad, and lingering headwinds from the financial crisis.  Although I am   cautiously optimistic that some of these forces will abate over time, I anticipate that they   will continue to restrain overall growth over the medium term, likely holding down the   level of interest rates consistent with stable labor market conditions.     Turning to inflation, we are now much closer to the FOMC’s 2 percent objective   than we were just a year ago.  Prices, as measured by the index for personal consumption   expenditures (PCE), rose nearly 1-1/2 percent in the 12 months ending in November, as                                                               4 In addition, a persistently strong labor market could potentially lead some firms to rely less on part-time  workers, or might encourage some people to rejoin the labor force who would otherwise sit on the  sidelines.  However, evidence on these sorts of endogenous supply-side effects is rather limited, as I noted  in a recent speech (see Yellen, 2016).    5 A summary of the projections submitted by Committee participants for the December 2016 FOMC  meeting can be found at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcprojtabl20161214.htm.    - 4 -     compared with only 1/2 percent during 2015.  Moreover, core PCE inflation--a better   indicator of the underlying inflation trend--picked up 1/4 percentage point, to a little over   1-1/2 percent.  This rise in inflation was anticipated and largely represents a fading of the   effects of earlier declines in energy prices and the prices of non-energy imports.  In   addition, slack in labor and product markets is no longer placing downward pressure on   inflation, in contrast to the situation only a few years ago when the unemployment rate   was still quite elevated.  Barring future major swings in oil prices and the foreign   exchange value of the dollar, inflation is likely to move up to 2 percent over the next   couple of years, aided by a strong labor market.     In light of the progress that has been achieved toward our employment and   inflation objectives and the Committee’s assessment of the outlook, the FOMC raised the   target range for the federal funds rate at its December meeting by 25 basis points, to   between 50 and 75 basis points.  The Committee judges, however, that the stance of   monetary policy remains modestly accommodative, and so policy should support some   further strengthening in labor market conditions and thus the return of inflation to our 2   percent goal.    Maintaining Sustainable Growth in a Context of Price Stability    With the unemployment rate near its longer-run normal level and likely to move a   bit lower this year, a natural question is whether monetary policy has fallen behind the   curve.  The short answer, I believe, is “no.”  It is true that many employers report   difficulties in finding qualified workers in selected occupations, and that more workers   are comfortable quitting jobs to take or look for better positions.  But this is to be    - 5 -     expected in a healthy labor market and not evidence that the economy as a whole is   experiencing a serious worker shortage.     The recent behavior of wages provides additional evidence pertaining to the   degree of labor market slack.  As shown in figure 3, increases in average hourly earnings,   the employment cost index, and compensation per hour remain subdued, picking up only   modestly of late.6  Again, these data do not seem consistent with an overheated labor   market.  Moreover, signs of overheating in the broader economy are also scarce.  For   example, capacity utilization in the manufacturing sector is well below its historical   average.  Most importantly, although core inflation is rising gradually from a low level,   this increase mainly reflects the waning of the effects of earlier movements in the dollar,   not upward pressure from resource utilization.   Of course, even if the labor market is not overheated currently, one might worry   that overheating could rapidly emerge as labor market conditions strengthen further,   causing inflation to surge.  I consider this unlikely for several reasons.  First, the pace of   labor market improvement has slowed appreciably in the past couple of years:  For   example, average payroll gains moderated from 250,000 per month in 2014 to 180,000   last year, and the unemployment rate declined 1-3/4 percentage points cumulatively over                                                               6 An exception to this pattern is the Atlanta Fed’s Wage Growth Tracker (WGT), which does show a  noticeable acceleration in hourly wages as self-reported in the Current Population Survey.  Like average  hourly earnings, the WGT excludes benefits costs and so is less comprehensive than the ECI or business- sector compensation per hour (CPH).  In addition, the WGT is based on a smaller sample than the measures  shown in Figure 3 and it only covers a sub-set of the workforce--specifically, employed individuals who  were also employed a year ago, and whose earnings are less than $150,000 per year.  Finally, because  average hourly earnings and business-sector CPH are measured as total wages divided by total hours, an  increase in wages for high earners has a larger effect in those measures than a similarly proportioned  increase for lower-wage workers, and this is not so for the WGT.    - 6 -     2014 and 2015, compared with only 1/4 percentage point last year.7  Second, economic   growth more broadly seems unlikely to pick up markedly in the near term given the   ongoing restraint from weak foreign demand and other factors that I mentioned,   particularly in an environment in which monetary policy is likely to become gradually   less accommodative.  Finally, figure 4 illustrates the relationship over the past several   decades between labor market pressures and core inflation.  Note that during periods   when the unemployment rate fell below the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate of its   normal long-run level, shown by the yellow shaded regions, core inflation, the solid red   line, rose little, if at all.  This stability is especially marked since inflation expectations   became anchored during the mid-to-late 1990s.8      That said, I think that allowing the economy to run markedly and persistently   “hot” would be risky and unwise.  Waiting too long to remove accommodation could   cause inflation expectations to begin ratcheting up, driving actual inflation higher and   making it harder to control.  The combination of persistently low interest rates and strong   labor market conditions could lead to undesirable increases in leverage and other   financial imbalances, although such risks would likely take time to emerge.9  Finally,                                                               7 Many other labor market indicators also improved more slowly in 2016 relative to the pace seen in the  prior two years, including the U-6 measure of labor utilization, the rates of job openings, hiring and quits,  survey readings on net hiring plans and the difficulty of filling vacancies, and the average duration of  unemployment.  A notable exception to this general pattern is the labor force participation rate, which  declined fairly steadily from 2007 through 2015 but then flattened out last year despite continuing  downward pressure from the aging of the population and other factors.  However, improvements in labor  market conditions along this dimension arguably reflect an increase in potential output, and so they are  probably not a source of inflationary pressures.   8 During the late 1960s through the 1970s, however, inflation did rise noticeably whenever the  unemployment rate moved below its longer-run normal level, primarily because the Federal Reserve did  not adequately check persistent movements in inflation by tightening monetary policy, thereby allowing  inflation expectations to drift.  This experience illustrates the importance of keeping inflation expectations  anchored through systematic policy actions.  9 The Federal Reserve closely monitors a wide range of indicators of financial stability, which currently  provide little evidence of significant increases in leverage or rapid growth in credit.  However, some asset    - 7 -     waiting too long to tighten policy could require the FOMC to eventually raise interest   rates rapidly, which could risk disrupting financial markets and pushing the economy into   recession.  For these reasons, I consider it prudent to adjust the stance of monetary policy   gradually over time--a strategy that should improve the prospects that the economy will   achieve sustainable growth with the labor market operating at full employment and   inflation running at about 2 percent.      Evaluating the Appropriate Stance of Monetary Policy   Achieving these goals could prove challenging, however, even if the economy   manages to avoid being hit with adverse shocks over the next few years.  To sustain a   strong job market with inflation at our 2 percent objective, policy must gradually shift   toward a neutral stance, where “neutral” is defined as a level of the federal funds rate that   is neither expansionary nor contractionary when the economy is operating near its   potential.  But what level of the federal funds rate is neutral at the present time?  How   quickly should the funds rate target move up to this neutral level? And how will the   neutral rate itself evolve over time?       To help answer such questions, the FOMC considers a voluminous amount of   information concerning many factors, including financial markets and credit availability,   labor market conditions and overall economic activity, wages and prices, and foreign   economic developments.  The FOMC also evaluates forecasts from a range of economic   models, assessments of key risks to the outlook, and detailed analyses of how different   monetary policy strategies would affect projected outcomes and risks.  Among the                                                               valuations, particularly for commercial real estate, are high.  With regard to the linkages between labor  utilization and financial stability, my interpretation of the historical evidence is that undesirable increases in  leverage or the emergence of asset bubbles are not the inevitable consequence of tight labor markets per se.    - 8 -     strategies routinely considered by the Committee are the recommendations of a variety of   simple monetary policy rules.  In addition, FOMC participants prepare individual   projections on a quarterly basis of the most likely paths of key macroeconomic variables   under their own assessments of “appropriate monetary policy,” together with their   estimates of the normal longer-run values of the federal funds rate, the unemployment   rate, and GDP growth.10  Armed with this wealth of information, the Committee as a   whole then decides on the most appropriate policy action to adopt at each of its meetings.    Such a comprehensive, forward-looking approach to policymaking is similar to that   employed at other central banks.11   Figure 5 shows a plot of FOMC participants’ most recent assessments of the   appropriate path for the federal funds rate through 2019.  The black solid lines show the   median value of the federal funds rate at the end of each year.  To understand the   considerations that likely underlay these judgments, I will contrast participants’   assessments with the recommendations of some simple policy rules commonly used to   help gauge the appropriate stance of policy.  As I noted, the Committee routinely reviews   policy recommendations from a variety of benchmark rules, and I believe that their   prescriptions can be helpful in providing broad guidance about how the federal funds rate   should be adjusted over time in response to movements in real activity and inflation.    That said, I will emphasize that the use and interpretation of such prescriptions require                                                               10 These individual projections are published quarterly in the Summary of Economic Projections that  accompanies the release of the minutes from the March, June, September and December meetings of the  FOMC.  11 The FOMC’s procedures share many of the features of forecast targeting, an approach to monetary  policymaking advocated by Svensson (2005), among others.  However, while the Committee publishes  participants’ projections--including policy paths--in the SEP, it does not publish a “consensus” forecast, in  contrast to some other central banks.     - 9 -     careful judgments about both the measurement of the inputs to these rules and the   implications of the many considerations the rules do not take into account.   Consider first the well-known Taylor rule, which embodies key principles of good   monetary policy.  The rule calls for systematic adjustments in the federal funds rate   relative to its expected longer-run neutral level in response to movements in inflation and   the output gap, defined as the percentage difference between actual output and the   economy’s productive potential.12  To implement the rule, one must decide on the   appropriate definition and measurement of its inputs.  Should inflation be defined using   the latest noisy quarterly reading on headline PCE inflation or a measure intended to   smooth through transitory price movements?  What technique should be used to   approximate the output gap, given that different approaches often yield materially   different estimates?  And what assumption should be made about the neutral value of the   federal funds rate in the longer run?     The Taylor rule is often implemented by assuming that the real, or inflation-  adjusted, value of the longer-run neutral interest rate--which I will call R* for                                                               12 Formally, the rule originally published by Taylor (1993) can be written as 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋∗) + 0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 , where R is the federal funds rate, R* is the level of the real federal funds rate that on  average is expected to be consistent with sustaining maximum employment and stable inflation in the  longer run, π is current inflation, π* is the central bank’s inflation objective (2 percent, in the case of the  Federal Reserve), and Y is the output gap, defined as the difference between the current level of real GDP  and what it would be if the economy was operating at maximum employment.  Importantly, the rule  embodies three key principles that central banks take into account when setting policy to stabilize inflation  and the overall economy.  First, a persistent movement in inflation requires a more than one-for-one  response of the policy rate to stabilize inflation.  Second, monetary policy should raise real interest rates  above their normal longer-run level whenever inflation is above its desired level and resource utilization is  higher than normal, and lower them when the opposite holds.  (Note that implementing this latter principle  requires estimates of both the economy’s productive potential and the longer-run level of the real policy  rate that would be consistent with keeping the economy operating on an even keel.)  And, finally,  policymakers should respond in a systematic manner to changes in economic conditions in order to help  financial market participants and others better understand how policy is likely to respond over time to  current and future events, thereby influencing expectations in a way that promotes economic stability.    - 10 -     convenience--is equal to 2 percent, roughly the average historical value of the real federal   funds rate prior to the financial crisis.  For inflation, we can use the 12-month change in   core PCE prices, a measure of the current underlying rate of inflation.  And the output   gap can be reasonably approximated as twice the difference between the estimated   longer-run normal rate of unemployment and the actual unemployment rate.13  The   dashed red line in figure 5 shows the resulting recommendations for policy over the   medium term, based on the medians of the unemployment and inflation projections   submitted by FOMC participants in December but assuming--in contrast to the median of   participants’ December assessments--that R* equals 2 percent.  As figure 5 shows, this   version of the Taylor rule prescribes a much higher path for the federal funds rate than   the median of participants’ assessments of appropriate policy.   One important factor explaining this divergence is the FOMC’s growing   recognition that the longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate has likely   declined below 2 percent, contrary to what is often assumed in implementations of the   Taylor rule.  As illustrated by the left-hand panel of figure 6, since 2000, both FOMC   participants and respondents to the Blue Chip survey have markedly reduced their   projections of the level of real short-term interest rates expected to prevail in the longer   run.  Presumably, these revisions were made in response to accumulating evidence that   lower real interest rates than those seen on average in the past would be needed   permanently to keep the economy operating on an even keel.  In addition, the right-hand   panel shows considerable changes over time in estimates of the normal longer-run rate of                                                               13 Historically, percent deviations of real GDP from statistical estimates of its long-run trend are roughly  twice as large on average as deviations of the unemployment rate from its estimated long-run value--a  relationship known as Okun’s law.       - 11 -     unemployment, with corresponding implications for estimates of the economy’s   productive potential and the output gap.  Such revisions would imply shifts in the level of   the Taylor rule’s prescriptions by as much as 1-1/4 percentage points, holding other   factors constant.14  Clearly, sensible implementation of policy rules requires adjustments   to take such changes into account, as a failure to do so would result in poor monetary   policy decisions and poor economic outcomes.15   Figure 7 illustrates the policy implications of alternative revised assessments of   the longer-run neutral real rate of interest.  As before, the short-dashed red line shows the   prescriptions of the Taylor rule using the standard 2 percent assumption for R*.  The   solid red line, however, shows the rule’s prescriptions with R* equal to 1 percent, the   median of the longer-run projections of the real federal funds rate made by FOMC   participants last month.  This adjustment appreciably reduces the rule’s policy   prescriptions.    Even with this downward adjustment of the longer-run neutral rate, however, the   Taylor rule’s prescriptions are arguably still too restrictive.  The problem is that the rule   ignores the likelihood that it will likely take many years before the forces now restraining                                                               14 Additional complications arise in the measurement of economic slack because the difference between the  unemployment rate and its estimated normal level is not always a complete gauge of overall labor  utilization.  Such was the case in the current expansion until recently because the labor force participation  rate was unusually low and involuntary part-time employment unusually high, given the level of the  unemployment rate.  Moreover, although movements in resource utilization for the economy as a whole are  generally proportional to changes in labor utilization, the relationship varies somewhat over time. Partly as  a result, contemporaneous estimates of the output gap can deviate markedly from subsequent estimates for  the same period calculated using revised data.  For example, in early 2010, the Congressional Budget  Office (CBO) estimated that the output gap in 2009:Q2 was negative 7.7 percent, but the CBO has since  lowered it to negative 6.3 percent--a large revision with important implications for assessments of the  deviation of actual policy from the prescriptions of simple policy rules.     15 If monetary policy persistently followed the prescriptions of a Taylor rule that assumed that R* was  2 percent when it was in fact 1 percent, then employment would run persistently below its maximum  sustainable level and inflation would run persistently below 2 percent.  Under such circumstances, inflation  expectations might begin to fall, creating a risk of deflation.       - 12 -     the economy dissipate to the degree envisioned in participants’ estimates of the longer-  run normal level of the real federal funds rate.  Because overall growth has been quite   moderate over the past few years despite an accommodative stance of monetary policy,   some recent estimates of the current value of the neutral real federal funds rate stand   close to zero.16  If the neutral rate were to remain quite low over the medium term, as   would be expected if the global economy does not materially strengthen and productivity   growth remains anemic, then the appropriate setting for R* in the Taylor rule would   arguably be zero, yielding a yet lower path for the federal funds rate, as shown by the   long-dashed red line.  These considerations illustrate that there is now no obvious “right”   setting for R* because we do not know how rapidly the forces restraining the economy   will abate, and there is a significant risk that it could be very slow.  When the economy   has been hit with unusually persistent shocks, the Taylor rule, for this reason, provides a   problematic benchmark.     Simple policy rules also typically neglect information with potentially important   implications for the economic outlook because they focus only on where conditions are   today.  For example, simple rules ignore such important factors as fiscal policy, trends   affecting global growth, structural developments influencing the supply of credit, and   overall financial conditions.  One special factor at the moment pertains to the Federal   Reserve’s balance sheet.  The downward pressure on longer-term interest rates that the   Fed’s asset holdings exert is expected to diminish over time--a development that amounts                                                               16 For example, see Holston, Laubach, and Williams (2016).      - 13 -     to a “passive” removal of monetary policy accommodation.  Other things being equal,   this factor argues for a more gradual approach to raising short-term rates.17     Lastly, simple rules ignore important risk-management considerations that have   influenced the Committee’s decisions in recent years.  With the federal funds rate still   near zero, the Committee recognizes that, should the economy unexpectedly weaken in   the next year or two, there would likely be only limited scope to respond by lowering   short-term rates.  But if the economy instead began to overheat, threatening to push   inflation to an undesirably high level, the FOMC would have ample scope to respond   through tighter monetary policy.  Such asymmetric risks arguably call for a more gradual   path of rate increases than indicated by the prescriptions of a simple policy rule.   The academic literature on policy rules has studied many alternatives to the   Taylor rule, and the FOMC regularly reviews a number of them.18  These rules embed   differing but valuable perspectives, and there is no consensus among central bankers or   academics about the relative utility of various rules.  One such alternative is the   “balanced approach” rule, illustrated by the purple short-dashed line in figure 8.  This   rule differs from the Taylor rule by being twice as responsive to movements in resource                                                               17 Based on estimates generated using the term-structure model developed by Li and Wei (2013) and the  procedure discussed in Ihrig and others (2012) and extended by Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015),  the Federal Reserve’s holdings of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities continue to  put considerable downward pressure on longer-term interest rates.  However, this pressure is estimated to  be gradually easing as the average maturity of the portfolio declines and the end-date for reinvestment  draws closer.  Over the course of 2017, this easing could increase the yield on the 10-year Treasury note by  about 15 basis points, all else being equal.  Based on the estimated co-movement of short-term and long- term interest rates, such a change in longer-term yields would be similar to that which, on average, has  historically accompanied two 25 basis point hikes in the federal funds rate.    18 For example, prescriptions from seven different rules, calculated using forecasts of economic activity and  inflation from different sources, are regularly posted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland at  https://www.clevelandfed.org/our-research/indicators-and-data/simple-monetary-policy-rules.aspx.    - 14 -     utilization.19  The prescriptions of the balanced-approach rule in this figure, as with the   solid red Taylor-rule plot, assume that R* equals 1 percent, consistent with the medians   of the latest FOMC projections.  Because participants on average anticipate a modest   undershooting of the unemployment rate below its estimated longer-run level, the   balanced-approach rule calls for a slightly faster pace of tightening over the next several   years than the Taylor rule.     Figure 8 also reports results for a “change” rule, shown as the green long-dashed   line.  As its name implies, this rule does not prescribe a particular level of the federal   funds rate at a given time but rather how the existing rate should change from quarter to   quarter based on two gaps--the difference between inflation and its desired level as well   as the difference between the unemployment rate and its longer-run normal level.20  In   contrast to the other two rules, the change rule does not take a stand on the value of the   longer-run neutral level of the real federal funds rate, thus avoiding a potential source of   error.  Instead, it moves interest rates up and down until both gaps close, an approach that   in theory enables it to perform well when the true value of R* is unknown.  Because both   gaps are relatively modest at the moment and are projected to remain so, the change rule   calls for fairly gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy over the next few   years given the current outlook.                                                               19 The balanced-approach rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 𝜋𝜋∗) + 1.0𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where all terms are defined as in  the Taylor rule.  (See note 12 for details.)  As noted by Taylor (1999), research suggests that this rule may  do a better job than the Taylor rule in stabilizing real activity and inflation.  20 The change rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡−1 + 1.2(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 2) + 2.0(𝑈𝑈∗ − 𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡), where R is the federal funds rate, π is four- quarter rate of core PCE inflation, U* is the projected longer-run unemployment rate, and U is the current  unemployment rate.  In computing the prescriptions for the change rule shown in figure 8, the midpoint of  the target range for the federal funds rate prior to the December 2016 FOMC meeting, 0.38 percent, is used  as the starting point.  For a discussion of this rule (and of policy rules in general), see Taylor and Williams  (2010).      - 15 -     The FOMC, for reasons that I have discussed, does not base its decisions on the   prescriptions of any specific policy rule.  Nevertheless, the three benchmarks I have   described--the Taylor rule, the balanced-approach rule, and the change rule, appropriately   calibrated--have historically provided useful guidance about appropriate adjustments in   the general direction of monetary policy over time.  This guidance is illustrated by   figure 9, which compares the path of the federal funds rate since 2000 with the   prescriptions of the three rules, based on the actual rates of inflation and unemployment   observed at each point in time, along with contemporaneous Blue Chip projections of the   longer-run unemployment rate and R*.     As the figure shows, the rules clearly signaled that a major reduction in the   federal funds rate was appropriate in 2008 given the marked deterioration in economic   conditions.  In addition, all three rules signaled that monetary policy needed to provide   more stimulus during the recession and the subsequent recovery than could be provided   by keeping short-term interest rates near zero.  For this reason, the Committee turned to   asset purchases to help make up for the shortfall by putting additional downward pressure   on longer-term interest rates.  The FOMC also sought to compensate for its inability to   push the federal funds rate below zero by indicating that the funds rate would need to stay   unusually low for longer than would otherwise be expected and simple policy rules   would prescribe.21  Under this “make up” strategy, and taking into account the reasons   for deviating from the Taylor rule that I discussed a moment ago, the Committee kept the                                                               21 For example, the FOMC advised in the statement released after its December 2012 meeting that  conditions would likely warrant keeping the funds rate near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate  was above 6-1/2 percent--a threshold that was not passed until mid-2014.  As discussed by Reifschneider  and Williams (2000), Werning (2012), and Woodford (2012), this type of lower-for-longer guidance can  help compensate for the constraint on monetary policy created by the zero lower bound on nominal interest  rates.  Engen, Laubach, and Reifschneider (2015) find that the FOMC’s guidance, together with its asset  purchases, provided significant economic stimulus in the years following the financial crisis.    - 16 -     federal funds rate near zero for longer than two of the rules would have prescribed.  But   as labor market conditions continued to improve over time, the rising trajectories for the   federal funds rate prescribed by all three rules signaled that the time was drawing near to   begin gradually reducing monetary accommodation.  Consistent with this advice, the   FOMC suspended its asset purchase program in mid-2014 and began raising the federal   funds rate in late 2015.22     To sum up, simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks to help assess how   monetary policy should be adjusted over time.  However, their prescriptions must be   interpreted carefully, both because estimates of some of their key inputs can vary   significantly and because the rules often do not take into account important   considerations and information pertaining to the outlook.  For these reasons, the rules   should not be followed mechanically, since doing so could have adverse consequences   for the economy.   Conclusion    My remarks have focused on the policy trajectory that the Committee now   considers likely to be appropriate to sustain the economic expansion while keeping   inflation close to our 2 percent goal.  In concluding, it is important to emphasize the   considerable uncertainty that attaches to such assessments and the need to constantly   update them.       In particular, the path of the neutral federal funds rate, which plays an important   role in determining the appropriate policy path, is highly uncertain.  For example,   productivity growth is a key determinant of the neutral rate, and while most forecasters                                                               22 For a closer look at the FOMC’s policy actions in 2016 and their relationship to previous forecasts and  subsequent changes in economic conditions, see Nechio and Rudebusch (2016).    - 17 -     expect productivity growth to pick up from its recent unusually slow pace, the timing of   such a pickup is highly uncertain.  Indeed, there is little consensus among researchers   about the causes of the recent slowdown in productivity growth that has occurred both at   home and abroad.23  The strength of global growth will also have an important bearing on   the neutral rate through both trade and financial channels, and here, too, the scope for   surprises is considerable.  Finally, I would mention the potential for changes in fiscal   policy to affect the economic outlook and the appropriate policy path.  At this point,   however, the size, timing, and composition of such changes remain uncertain.24    However, as this discussion highlights, the course of monetary policy over the next few   years will depend on many different factors, of which fiscal policy is just one.                                                                23 To sample some of the different views about the sources of the recent slowdown in productivity growth  and the prospects for faster growth in the future, see Gordon (2016), Fernald and Wang (2015),  Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014), and Decker and others (2016, forthcoming).  24 A related source of uncertainty is the limited ability of economists to predict the effects of specific  changes in tax policy or government spending on the overall economy.  In part, this uncertainty arises  because the net effect depends to some extent on the response of financial markets; in addition, estimates  vary considerably on the economic effects of changes in marginal tax rates or different types of spending.      - 18 -     References     Aaronson, Stephanie, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher   Smith, and William Wascher (2014).  “Labor Force Participation:  Recent  Developments and Future Prospects,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity,  Fall, pp. 197-255, www.brookings.edu/wp- content/uploads/2016/07/Fall2014BPEA_Aaronson_et_al.pdf.
