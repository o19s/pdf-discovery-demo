Yellen     Chair     Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System     at     “The New Normal Monetary Policy,” a research conference   sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco     San Francisco, California    March 27, 2015       I would like to thank President Williams for his kind introduction and the Federal   Reserve Bank of San Francisco for inviting me to what promises to be a very stimulating   and important conference.   As you know, last week the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) changed   its forward guidance pertaining to the federal funds rate.  With continued improvement in   economic conditions, an increase in the target range for that rate may well be warranted   later this year.  Of course, the timing of the first increase in the federal funds rate and its   subsequent path will be determined by the Committee in light of incoming data on labor   market conditions, inflation, and other aspects of the current expansion.     In my remarks today I will discuss some factors that will likely guide our   decisions as we adjust the stance of monetary policy over time.  I will also discuss why   most of my colleagues and I believe the return of the federal funds rate to a more normal   level is likely to be gradual.  In doing so, I will address three questions.  First, why does   the Committee judge that an increase in the federal funds rate target is likely to become   appropriate later this year?  Second, how are economic and financial considerations likely   to shape the course of monetary policy over the next several years?  And, finally, are   there special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take into account in   the current environment?   Current Economic Conditions and the Outlook   Before turning to these questions, however, let me first review where the   economy is now and where it’s likely headed--a necessary backdrop for understanding   why, after more than six years of maintaining a near-zero federal funds rate and   accumulating a large portfolio of longer-term securities, the Committee is now giving     - 2 -   serious consideration to beginning to reduce later this year some of the extraordinary   monetary policy accommodation currently in place.   Although the recovery of the labor market from the deep recession following the   financial crisis was frustratingly slow for quite a long time, progress has been more rapid   of late.  The unemployment rate has fallen markedly over the past few years and now   stands at 5.5 percent, down from 10 percent at its peak.  Payroll gains have averaged   275,000 per month over the past year, well above the pace needed to sustain further   declines in the unemployment rate.  Of course, we still have some way to go to reach our   maximum employment goal.  The unemployment rate has not yet declined to the 5.0 to   5.2 percent range that most FOMC participants now consider to be normal in the longer   run.  Involuntary part-time employment remains high by historical standards.  Labor   force participation is still somewhat lower than I would expect after accounting for   demographic trends.1  And wage growth continues to be quite subdued.  But I think we   can all agree that the recovery in the labor market has been substantial.   I am cautiously optimistic that, in the context of moderate growth in aggregate   output and spending, labor market conditions are likely to improve further in coming   months.  In particular, and despite the somewhat disappointing tone of the recent retail   1 For a discussion of the influence of demographics and other factors on the labor force participation rate in  recent years, see Stephanie Aaronson, Tomaz Cajner, Bruce Fallick, Felix Galbis-Reig, Christopher Smith,  and William Wascher (2014), “Labor Force Participation:  Recent Developments and Future Prospects,”  Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Washington:  Brookings Institution, Fall),  www.brookings.edu/about/projects/bpea/papers/2014/labor-force-participation-recent-developments-and- future-prospects.  In addition, for evidence that the labor force participation rate is currently unusually low  from a cyclical perspective, see Robert E. Hall (2014), “Quantifying the Lasting Harm to the U.S. Economy  from the Financial Crisis,” in Jonathan Parker and Michael Woodford, eds., NBER Macroeconomics  Annual 2014, vol. 29 (Chicago:  University of Chicago Press); and Council of Economic Advisers (2014),  “The Labor Force Participation Rate since 2007:  Causes and Policy Implications” (Washington:  CEA,  July), www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/docs/labor_force_participation_report.pdf.         - 3 -   sales data, I think consumer spending is likely to expand at a good clip this year given   such robust fundamentals as strong employment gains, boosts to real incomes from lower   energy prices, continued increases in household wealth, and a relatively high level of   consumer confidence.  Of course, not all sectors of the economy are doing as well:  dollar   appreciation appears to be restraining net exports, low oil prices are prompting a cutback   in drilling activity, and the recovery in residential construction remains subdued.  But   overall, I anticipate that real gross domestic product is likely to expand somewhat faster   than its potential in coming quarters, thereby promoting further gains in employment and   declines in the unemployment rate.   In assessing the actual strength of the labor market and the broader economy, we   must bear in mind that these very welcome improvements have been achieved in the   context of extraordinary monetary accommodation.  While the overall level of real   activity now appears to be much closer to its potential than it was a year or two ago, the   economy in an “underlying” sense remains quite weak by historical standards, for the   simple reason that the increases in hiring and output that have been achieved thus far   have required exceptionally low levels of short- and longer-term interest rates, reflecting   a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy.  Interest rates have been, and remain,   very low, and if underlying conditions had truly returned to normal, the economy should   be booming.  As I will discuss shortly, this assessment concerning the underlying   strength of real activity has important policy implications.   While there has been considerable progress on the maximum employment leg of   our dual mandate, progress on the price stability leg has been notably absent.  Inflation as   measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures has been running     - 4 -   below the FOMC’s longer-run goal of 2 percent for a number of years, and on a   12-month basis is currently 1/4 percent.  Some of the weakness in inflation likely reflects   continuing slack in labor and product markets.  However, much of this weakness stems   from the sharp decline in the price of oil and other one-time factors that, in the FOMC’s   judgment, are likely to have only a transitory negative effect on inflation, provided that   inflation expectations remain well anchored.     In this regard, I take comfort from the continued stability of survey measures of   longer-run inflation expectations.  And although market-based measures of inflation   compensation have declined appreciably since last summer and bear close watching, I   suspect that these declines are primarily driven by changes in risk premiums and market   factors that I expect to prove transitory.  On balance, I therefore think it is appropriate for   monetary policy to remain accommodative for some time, fostering an environment of   tightening labor and product markets that, together with stable inflation expectations, will   help move inflation up to 2 percent over the medium term.     Why Might an Increase in the Federal Funds Rate Be Warranted Later This Year?     The Committee's decision about when to begin reducing accommodation will   depend importantly on how economic conditions actually evolve over time.  Like most of   my FOMC colleagues, I believe that the appropriate time has not yet arrived, but I expect   that conditions may warrant an increase in the federal funds rate target sometime this   year.  So let me spell out the reasoning that underpins this view.    I would first note that the current stance of monetary policy is clearly providing   considerable economic stimulus.  The near-zero setting for the federal funds rate has   facilitated a sizable reduction in labor market slack over the past two years and appears to     - 5 -   be consistent with further substantial gains.  A modest increase in the federal funds rate   would be highly unlikely to halt this progress, although such an increase might slow its   pace somewhat.   Second, we need to keep in mind the well-established fact that the full effects of   monetary policy are felt only after long lags.  This means that policymakers cannot wait   until they have achieved their objectives to begin adjusting policy.  I would not consider   it prudent to postpone the onset of normalization until we have reached, or are on the   verge of reaching, our inflation objective.  Doing so would create too great a risk of   significantly overshooting both our objectives of maximum sustainable employment and   2 percent inflation, potentially undermining economic growth and employment if the   FOMC is subsequently forced to tighten policy markedly or abruptly.  In addition,   holding rates too low for too long could encourage inappropriate risk-taking by investors,   potentially undermining the stability of financial markets.  That said, we must be   reasonably confident at the time of the first rate increase that inflation will move up over   time to our 2 percent objective, and that such an action will not impede continued solid   growth in employment and output.    An important factor working to increase my confidence in the inflation outlook   will be continued improvement in the labor market.  A substantial body of theory,   informed by considerable historical evidence, suggests that inflation will eventually begin   to rise as resource utilization continues to tighten.2  It is largely for this reason that a   2 For recent evidence on the relationship between labor market slack and wages, see Anil Kumar and Pia  Orrenius (2014), “A Closer Look at the Phillips Curve Using State Level Data,” Working Papers 1409  (Dallas:  Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas),  www.dallasfed.org/assets/documents/research/papers/2014/wp1409.pdf; and Daniel Aaronson and Andrew  Jordan (2014), “Understanding the Relationship between Real Wage Growth and Labor Market  Conditions,” Chicago Fed Letter No. 327 (Chicago:  Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, October),  www.chicagofed.org/publications/chicago-fed-letter/2014/october-327.  The price Phillips curve is       - 6 -   significant pickup in incoming readings on core inflation will not be a precondition for   me to judge that an initial increase in the federal funds rate would be warranted.  With   respect to wages, I anticipate that real wage gains for American workers are likely to pick   up to a rate more in line with trend labor productivity growth as employment settles in at   its maximum sustainable level.  We could see nominal wage growth eventually running   notably higher than the current roughly 2 percent pace.  But the outlook for wages is   highly uncertain even if price inflation does move back to 2 percent and labor market   conditions continue to improve as projected.  For example, we cannot be sure about the   future pace of productivity growth; nor can we be sure about other factors, such as global   competition, the nature of technological change, and trends in unionization, that may also   influence the pace of real wage growth over time.  These factors, which are outside of the   Federal Reserve’s control, likely explain why real wages have failed to keep pace with   productivity growth for at least the past 15 years.  For such reasons, we can never be sure   what growth rate of nominal wages is consistent with stable consumer price inflation, and   this uncertainty limits the usefulness of wage trends as an indicator of the Fed’s progress   in achieving its inflation objective.       I have argued that a pickup in neither wage nor price inflation is indispensable for   me to achieve reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to 2 percent over time.    That said, I would be uncomfortable raising the federal funds rate if readings on wage   discussed extensively in the literature; for instance, see Robert J. Gordon (2013), “The Phillips Curve Is  Alive and Well:  Inflation and the NAIRU during the Slow Recovery,” NBER Working Paper Series 19390  (Cambridge, Mass.:  National Bureau of Economic Research, August).  In addition, the apparent lack of  disinflationary pressure seen during the recent recession is not necessarily a puzzle for the New Keynesian  Phillips curve, as shown in Marco Del Negro, Marc P. Giannoni, and Frank Schorfheide (2015), “Inflation  in the Great Recession and New Keynesian Models,” American Economic Journal:  Macroeconomics,  vol. 7 (January), pp. 168-96.         - 7 -   growth, core consumer prices, and other indicators of underlying inflation pressures were   to weaken, if market-based measures of inflation compensation were to fall appreciably   further, or if survey-based measures were to begin to decline noticeably.     Under normal circumstances, simple monetary policy rules, such as the one   proposed by John Taylor, could help us decide when to raise the federal funds rate.3    Even with core inflation running below the Committee's 2 percent objective, Taylor’s   rule now calls for the federal funds rate to be well above zero if the unemployment rate is   currently judged to be close to its normal longer-run level and the “normal” level of the   real federal funds rate is currently close to its historical average.  But the prescription   offered by the Taylor rule changes significantly if one instead assumes, as I do, that   appreciable slack still remains in the labor market, and that the economy’s equilibrium   real federal funds rate--that is, the real rate consistent with the economy achieving   maximum employment and price stability over the medium term--is currently quite low   by historical standards.4  Under assumptions that I consider more realistic under present   circumstances, the same rules call for the federal funds rate to be close to zero.5    3 For the original exposition of the Taylor rule, see John B. Taylor (1993), “Discretion Versus Policy Rules  in Practice,” Carnegie-Rochester Conference Series on Public Policy, vol. 39, pp. 195-214.  For a  discussion of policy rules in general, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust  Rules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of  Monetary Economics, vol. 3B (San Diego:  Elsevier), pp. 829-59.      4 The equilibrium real rate is typically viewed as the level of the short-term interest rate, less inflation,  estimated to be consistent with maximum employment and stable inflation in the long run, assuming no  future disturbances to the economy.  Accordingly, the equilibrium real rate is usually thought of as  independent of the cyclical disturbances that routinely buffet the economy, on the assumption that the  influences of such disturbances on real activity and inflation fade away after a few years.  In the aftermath  of the financial crisis, however, the U.S. economy has been subject to various adjustment processes that are  unusually drawn out by historical standards, such as the ongoing repair of household balance sheets and  other persistent headwinds.  These atypical processes imply that, in determining the appropriate stance of  monetary policy over time, policymakers in the current environment need to take account of slow-moving  influences on both aggregate demand and supply that were not important factors during previous tightening  episodes.  For this reason, it is useful to think of the equilibrium real rate in present circumstances as not  only time-varying but also having a predictable element that evolves over the medium term.  5 For example, the Taylor rule is 𝑅𝑅𝑡𝑡 = 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅∗ + 𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 + 0.5(𝜋𝜋𝑡𝑡 − 2) + 0.5𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡, where R denotes the federal funds  rate, RR* is the estimated value of the equilibrium real rate, π is the current inflation rate (usually measured       - 8 -   Moreover, I would assert that simple rules are, well, too simple, and ignore important   complexities of the current situation, about which I will have more to say shortly.      The FOMC will, of course, carefully deliberate about when to begin the process   of removing policy accommodation.  But the significance of this decision should not be   overemphasized, because what matters for financial conditions and the broader economy   is the entire expected path of short-term interest rates and not the precise timing of the   first rate increase.  The spending and investment decisions the FOMC seeks to influence   depend primarily on expectations of policy well into the future, as embedded in longer-  term interest rates and other asset prices.  More important than the timing of the   Committee’s initial policy move will be the strategy the Committee deploys in adjusting   the federal funds rate over time, in response to economic developments, to achieve its   dual mandate.  Market participants’ perceptions of that reaction function and the   implications for the likely longer-run trajectory of short-term interest rates will influence   the borrowing costs faced by households and businesses, including the rates on corporate   bonds, auto loans, and home mortgages.       How Are Economic and Financial Considerations Likely to Shape the Course of   Monetary Policy over the Next Several Years?     Let me therefore turn to the second question I posed earlier:  How are economic   and financial considerations likely to shape the course of monetary policy over the next   using a core consumer price index), and Y is the output gap.  The latter can be approximated using Okun’s  law, 𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 = −2(𝑈𝑈𝑡𝑡 − 𝑈𝑈∗), where U is the unemployment rate and U* is the natural rate of unemployment.  If  RR* is assumed to equal 2 percent (roughly the average historical value of the real federal funds rate) and  U* is assumed to equal 5-1/2 percent, then the Taylor rule would call for the nominal funds rate to be set a  bit below 3 percent currently, given that core PCE inflation is now running close to 1-1/4 percent and the  unemployment rate is 5.5 percent.  But if RR* is instead assumed to equal 0 percent currently (as some  statistical models suggest) and U* is assumed to equal 5 percent (an estimate in line with many FOMC  participants’ SEP projections), then the rule’s current prescription is less than 1/2 percent.        - 9 -   few years?  Let me first be clear that the FOMC does not intend to embark on any   predetermined course of tightening following an initial decision to raise the funds rate   target range--one that, for example, would involve similarly sized rate increases at every   meeting or on some other schedule.  Rather, the actual path of policy will evolve as   economic conditions evolve, and policy tightening could speed up, slow down, pause, or   even reverse course depending on actual and expected developments in real activity and   inflation.  Reflecting such data dependence, as well as some historically unusual policy   considerations that I will discuss shortly, the average pace of tightening observed during   previous recoveries could well provide a highly misleading guide to the actual course of   monetary policy over the next few years.  Our goal in adjusting the federal funds rate   over time will be to achieve and sustain economic conditions close to maximum   employment with inflation averaging around 2 percent, responding, as best we can, to the   inevitable twists and turns of the economy.   Keeping in mind the all-important proviso that policy is never predetermined but   is always data dependent, what can we say about the appropriate path of policy, assuming   the most likely outcomes for real activity, inflation, and related factors?  The answer is   that it depends, of course, on one’s outlook for the economy.  Today I will focus on the   modal outlook presented by FOMC participants’ submissions to the March Summary of   Economic Projections (SEP), which assumes that no further unanticipated disturbances   buffet the economy.  As I noted at my press conference after last week’s FOMC meeting,   participants generally project that the unemployment rate will continue to fall through   late 2017 to levels at or somewhat below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level,   accompanied by growth in real gross domestic product that runs somewhat above its     - 10 -   estimated longer-run trend with inflation moving up to around 2 percent.  This solid   economic performance is projected to be consistent with a gradual normalization of   monetary policy:  The median funds rate projection in the March SEP increases   a percentage point per year on average through the end of 2017.     The projected combination of a gradual rise in the nominal federal funds rate   coupled with further progress on both legs of the dual mandate is consistent with an   implicit assessment by the Committee that the equilibrium real federal funds rate--one   measure of the economy’s underlying strength--is rising only slowly over time.  In the   wake of the financial crisis, the equilibrium real rate apparently fell well below zero   because of numerous persistent headwinds. These headwinds include tighter underwriting   standards and restricted access to some forms of credit; the need for households to reduce   their debt burdens; contractionary fiscal policy at all levels of government after the initial   effects of the fiscal stimulus package had passed; and elevated uncertainty about the   economic outlook that made firms hesitant to invest and hire, and households reluctant to   buy houses, cars, and other discretionary goods.     Fortunately, the overall force of these headwinds appears to have diminished   considerably over the past year or so, allowing employment to accelerate appreciably   even as the level of the federal funds rate and the volume of our asset holdings remained   nearly unchanged.6  Stated differently, the economy’s underlying strength has been   6 Although the FOMC suspended its asset purchase program last October, the stimulus provided by this  type of unconventional monetary policy action depends primarily on the stock of longer-term assets held by  the Federal Reserve, not the flow of securities bought.  Because the FOMC has held the size of the Federal  Reserve’s balance sheet constant since October while continuing to keep the federal funds rate near zero,  the overall stance of monetary policy is thus little changed over this period.  However, the downward  pressure on long-term interest rates from the Federal Reserve’s asset holdings should decline over time,  particularly after the FOMC suspends its current reinvestment policy, because the average duration of the  assets held in the portfolio will be steadily falling and because the relative size of the portfolio to the stock  of publicly held debt will be shrinking.       - 11 -   gradually improving, and the equilibrium real federal funds rate has been gradually   rising.  Although the recent appreciation of the dollar is likely to weigh on U.S. exports   over time, I nonetheless anticipate further diminution of the headwinds just noted over   the next couple of years, and as the equilibrium real funds rate continues to rise, it will   accordingly be appropriate to raise the actual level of the real federal funds rate in   tandem, all else being equal.7  At present, the equilibrium real federal funds rate, which   by some estimates is currently close to zero, appears to be well below the longer-run   normal levels assessed by the FOMC.  The median SEP estimate of this longer-run   normal rate--that is, the long-run projection of the nominal funds rate less 2 percent   inflation--stood at 1-3/4 percent in the FOMC's recent projections.8  Provided that   inflation shows clear signs over time of moving up toward 2 percent in the context of   continuing progress toward maximum employment, I therefore expect that a further   tightening in monetary policy after the first increase in the federal funds rate will be   warranted.  Should incoming data, however, fail to support this forecast, then the actual   path of policy will need to be adjusted appropriately.    7 If resource utilization was at a normal level and inflation was equal to 2 percent, policymakers would  presumably opt to set the real federal funds rate equal to the equilibrium real rate in order to maintain those  conditions.  Accordingly, if the equilibrium rate is rising over time, the “neutral” setting of monetary policy  should be rising in tandem.  8 For example, the estimate of the equilibrium real rate from the Laubach-Williams model for 2014:Q4 is  negative 0.16.  For information on the model, see Thomas Laubach and John C. Williams (2003),  “Measuring the Natural Rate of Interest,” Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 85 (November),  pp. 1063-70; updated estimates of the baseline model are available on the Federal Reserve Bank of San  Francisco website at www.frbsf.org/economic-research/economists/john- williams/Laubach_Williams_updated_estimates.xlsx.  Another recent study, however, concludes that the  equilibrium real rate is probably in the range of 1 to 2 percent while also emphasizing that estimates in this  area are quite imprecise; see James D. Hamilton, Ethan S. Harris, Jan Hatzius, and Kenneth D. West  (2015), “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate:  Past, Present, and Future,” working paper (San Diego:   University of California at San Diego, March), http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~jhamilto/USMPF_2015.pdf.  Note that the concept of the equilibrium real rate used in the latter study is explicitly long-run in nature and  so excludes the effects of forces that have persistently restrained the pace of the current expansion but are  expected to eventually fade away, such as household balance sheet repair; for this reason, the paper’s  estimate is higher than the medium-run concept of the equilibrium real rate discussed in the speech.       - 12 -   Are There Special Risks and Other Considerations That Policymakers Should Take   into Account in the Current Environment?   As I noted, my FOMC colleagues and I generally anticipate that a rather gradual   rise in the federal funds rate will be appropriate over the next few years, conditional on   our baseline forecasts for real activity, inflation, and other aspects of the economy’s   performance.  So far in my remarks, I have emphasized one key rationale for such a   judgment--namely, that the equilibrium real federal funds rate is at present well below its   historical average and is anticipated to rise only gradually over time as the various   headwinds that have restrained the economic recovery continue to abate.  If incoming   data support such a forecast, the federal funds rate should be normalized, but at a gradual   pace.   Several additional factors reinforce this conclusion, and that brings me to my third   question:  Are there special risks and other considerations that policymakers should take   into account in the current environment?  Keeping in mind that the actual course of   monetary policy in the future will primarily depend on events as they unfold, I see three   additional considerations that are relevant.9     The first, which is closely related to my expectation that the headwinds holding   back growth are likely to continue to abate gradually, pertains to the risk that the   equilibrium real federal funds rate may not, in fact, recover as much or as quickly as I   9 In principle, the three considerations--uncertainty about the value of the equilibrium real federal funds  rate, the asymmetric risks associated with the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, and the potential  benefits of allowing the unemployment rate to temporarily undershoot its sustainable longer-run rate-- should influence both the timing of the onset of policy normalization and the subsequent pace at which that  normalization proceeds.  And in fact, I view all three considerations as helping to explain why the FOMC  has held the federal funds rate near zero for so long.  I also view such considerations as consistent with a  likely increase in the target federal funds rate later this year, because such an increase would be part of a  broader strategy for only gradually reducing accommodation over time (subject, of course, to adjustments  in response to incoming information on real activity, inflation, and other factors).       - 13 -   anticipate.  Substantial uncertainty surrounds all estimates of the equilibrium real interest   rate, and, as I will discuss momentarily, market participants appear to be fairly   pessimistic about the odds that it will rise significantly over time.  Moreover, some recent   studies have raised the prospect that the economies of the United States and other   countries will grow more slowly in the future as a result of both demographic factors and   a slower pace of productivity gains from technological advances.  At an extreme, such   developments could even amount to a type of “secular stagnation,” in which monetary   policy would need to keep real interest rates persistently quite low relative to historical   norms to promote full employment and price stability, absent a highly expansive fiscal   policy.10     Such a risk has important implications for monetary policy in the near term, when   the ability of the economy to adjust to significant rate increases will be especially   uncertain.  The experience of Japan over the past 20 years, and Sweden more recently,   demonstrates that a tightening of policy when the equilibrium real rate remains low can   result in appreciable economic costs, delaying the attainment of a central bank’s price   stability objective.  International experience therefore counsels caution in removing   accommodation until the Committee is more confident that aggregate demand will   10 The concept of “secular stagnation” was first coined back in the late 1930s; see Alvin H. Hansen (1938),  “The Consequences of Reducing Expenditures,” Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science, vol. 17  (January), pp. 60-72; and Alvin H. Hansen (1939),  “Economic Progress and Declining Population  Growth,” American Economic Review, vol. 29 (March), pp. 1-15.  This possibility, and its applicability to  the United States and other developed economies in coming years, has received considerable attention of  late; see Robert J. Gordon (2014), “The Demise of U.S. Economic Growth:  Restatement, Rebuttal, and  Reflections,” NBER Working Paper Series 19895 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic  Research, February); Robert E. Hall (2014), “Quantifying the Lasting Harm to the U.S. Economy from the  Financial Crisis,” in Jonathan Parker and Michael Woodford, eds., NBER Macroeconomics Annual, vol. 29  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press); and Lawrence H. Summers (2014), “U.S. Economic Prospects:   Secular Stagnation, Hysteresis, and the Zero Lower Bound,” Business Economics, vol. 49 (April),  pp. 65-73.  For a more skeptical assessment of the secular stagnation hypothesis, see Hamilton and others,  “The Equilibrium Real Funds Rate,” in note 8.       - 14 -   continue to expand in line with its expectations--a view that is also supported by the   research literature.11    A second reason for the Committee to proceed cautiously in removing policy   accommodation relates to asymmetries in the effectiveness of monetary policy in the   vicinity of the zero lower bound.  In the event that growth in employment and overall   activity proves unexpectedly robust and inflation moves significantly above our 2 percent   objective, the FOMC can and will raise interest rates as needed to rein in inflation.  But if   growth was to falter and inflation was to fall yet further, the effective lower bound on   nominal interest rates could limit the Committee’s ability to provide the needed degree of   accommodation.  With an already large balance sheet, for example, the FOMC might be   concerned about potential costs and risks associated with further asset purchases.     Research suggests that, the higher the probability of monetary policy becoming   constrained by the zero lower bound in the near future because of adverse shocks, and the   more severe the attendant consequences for real activity and inflation, the more current   policy should lean in accommodative direction.12  In effect, such a strategy represents   insurance against the zero lower bound by aiming for somewhat stronger real activity and   11 A number of studies have shown, using model simulations, that policymakers can improve  macroeconomic performance by adjusting the stance of monetary policy more cautiously in response to  changes in economic conditions when the economy’s equilibrium real interest rate is uncertain.  For a  survey of the literature on this issue, see John B. Taylor and John C. Williams (2010), “Simple and Robust  Rules for Monetary Policy,” in Benjamin M. Friedman and Michael Woodford, eds., Handbook of  Monetary Economics, vol. 3B (San Diego:  Elsevier), pp. 829-59.  12 For example, see Klaus Adam and Roberto M. Billi (2007), “Discretionary Monetary Policy and the Zero  Lower Bound on Nominal Interest Rates,” Journal of Monetary Economics, vol. 54 (3), 728-52; Taisuke  Nakata (2013), “Optimal Fiscal and Monetary Policy with Occasionally Binding Zero Bound Constraints,”  Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-40 (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System, April), www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201340/201340pap.pdf; Taisuke Nakata  (2013), “Uncertainty at the Zero Lower Bound,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2013-09  (Washington:  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, December 2012),  www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2013/201309/201309pap.pdf; and Charles Evans, Jonas Fisher, Francois  Gourio, and Spencer Krane (forthcoming), “Risk Management for Monetary Policy Near the Zero Lower  Bound,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity (Washington:  Brookings Institution).       - 15 -   a faster rise in inflation under the modal outlook.  Given the modal outlook envisioned in   FOMC participants’ recent forecasts, with headwinds continuing to diminish, the   equilibrium real rate rising, and inflation moving back up to 2 percent over the next few   years, the risk that the funds rate would need to return to near zero should be declining   appreciably.  Consistent with this assessment, almost all FOMC participants now view   the risks to the outlook for real activity as largely balanced, although some also see   inflation risks as weighted to the downside.   That said, it is sobering to note that many market participants appear to assess the   risks to the outlook quite differently.  For example, respondents to the Survey of Primary   Dealers in late January thought there was a 20 percent probability that, after liftoff, the   funds rate would fall back to zero sometime at or before late 2017.13  In addition, both the   remarkably low level of long-term government bond yields in advanced economies and   the low prevailing level of inflation compensation suggest that financial market   participants may hold more pessimistic views than FOMC participants concerning the   risks to the global outlook.  Since long-term yields reflect the market’s probability-  weighted average of all possible short-term interest rate paths, along with compensating   term and risk premiums, the generally low level of yields in advanced economies   suggests that investors place considerable odds on adverse scenarios that would   necessitate a lower and flatter trajectory of the federal funds than envisioned in   participants’ modal SEP projections.14    13 See Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Markets Group (2015), Responses to Survey of Primary Dealers  (New York:  FRBNY, January), www.newyorkfed.org/markets/survey/2015/January-result.pdf.  14 Of course, low long-term yields in the United States may not reflect investor pessimism about U.S.  economic prospects but instead an expectation that weak economic performance abroad may result in  persistent upward pressure on the dollar, thereby putting downward pressure on U.S. net exports,  employment, inflation, and thus short-term interest rates.  On a closely related issue concerning evidence  that investors’ perceptions of the likelihood of high inflation versus low inflation have shifted noticeably in       - 16 -   A final argument for gradually adjusting policy relates to the desirability of   achieving a prompt return of inflation to the FOMC’s 2 percent goal, an objective that   would be advanced by allowing the unemployment rate to decline for a time somewhat   below estimates of its longer-run sustainable level.  To a limited degree, such an outcome   is envisioned in many participants’ most recent SEP projections.  A tight labor market   may also work to reverse some of the adverse supply-side developments resulting from   the financial crisis.  The deep recession and slow recovery likely have held back   investment in physical and human capital, restrained the rate of new business formation,   prompted discouraged workers to leave the labor force, and eroded the skills of the long-  term unemployed.15  Some of these effects might be reversed in a tight labor market,   yielding long-term benefits associated with a more productive economy.  That said, the   quantitative importance of these supply-side mechanisms are difficult to establish, and   the relevant research on this point is quite limited.      Of course, taking a gradualist approach is not without risks.  Proceeding too   slowly to tighten policy could have adverse consequences for the attainment of the   Committee’s inflation objective over time, especially if it were to undermine the FOMC’s   inflation credibility.  Inflation could, for example, exhibit nonlinear dynamics in which   high levels of unemployment place relatively little downward pressure on inflation, but   tight labor markets generate marked upward pressure.  If so, a decline in unemployment   recent months, see Justin Wolfers (2015), “A Prediction Market for Inflation, or Deflation,” The Upshot,  New York Times, March 6.  This piece relies heavily on work by Yuriy Kitsul and Jonathan H. Wright  (2013), “The Economics of Options-Implied Inflation Probability Density Functions,” Journal of Financial  Economics, vol. 110 (December), 696-711.  15 For a discussion of these effects, see Dave Reifschneider, William Wascher, and David Wilcox (2015),  “Aggregate Supply in the United States:  Recent Developments and Implications for the Conduct of  Monetary Policy,” IMF Economic Review advance online publication, March 17, doi:  10.1057/imfer.2015.1.       - 17 -   below its natural rate could cause inflation to quickly rise to an undesirably high level.    Rapid increases in short-term interest rates to arrest such an unwelcome development   could, in turn, have adverse effects on financial markets and the broader economy.   Proceeding too cautiously could also have undesirable effects on financial   stability.  An environment of prolonged low short-term rates could prompt an excessive   buildup in leverage or cause underwriting standards to erode as investors take on risks   they cannot measure or manage appropriately in a reach for yield.16  At this point the   evidence indicates that such vulnerabilities do not pose a significant threat, but the   Committee is carefully monitoring developments in this area.17  Moreover, in my view,   macroprudential regulatory and supervisory tools should serve as our first line of defense   in addressing these risks.18    Conclusion   To conclude, let me emphasize that in determining when to initially increase its   target range for the federal funds rate and how to adjust it thereafter, the Committee’s   decisions will be data dependent, reflecting evolving judgments concerning the   implications of incoming information for the economic outlook.  We cannot be certain   about the underlying strength of the expansion, the maximum level of employment   consistent with price stability, or the longer-run level of interest rates consistent with   16 Jeremy C.

Policy must adjust as our understanding of these factors   changes.  However, if conditions do evolve in the manner that most of my FOMC   colleagues and I anticipate, I would expect the level of the federal funds rate to be   normalized only gradually, reflecting the gradual diminution of headwinds from the   financial crisis and the balance of risks I have enumerated of moving either too slowly or   too quickly.  Nothing about the course of the Committee’s actions is predetermined   except the Committee’s commitment to promote our dual mandate of maximum   employment and price stability.     ",
